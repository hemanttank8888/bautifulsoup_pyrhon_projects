"12 Quiet Habits of Enormously Successful Humans|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/12-quiet-habits.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| May your actions speak louder than your words. May your life preach louder than your lips. May your success be your noise in the end. The result of enormous success is often pretty noisy — lots of people talking, writing, and sharing stories about it. The actual process of achieving enormous success, on the other hand, is far more discreet. But it’s this process that happens quietly, behind-the-scenes, that makes all the difference in the world. Marc and I are fortunate enough to know a number of enormously successful human beings. Regardless of lifestyle, industry or profession, they share many of the same quiet habits. And that’s precisely what I want to discuss with you today. Here are twelve key things the most successful people we know do quietly and diligently: Too many books and courses on personal success act like we’re robots, and completely overlook the enormous power of our emotions. The less frenzied emotions we have at the start of the day, the less we will have all day. Because when we start the day in a calm and mindful state, it’s easier to focus and get the right things done. But when we wake up and stress is already upon us — phones ringing, emails and texts dinging, fire alarms going off — you spend the whole day reacting instead of being proactive. This means you’re not in the driver’s seat working on your priorities — the things that drive success. You’re simply responding to what gets thrown at you, whether it’s important or not. Try to have the first hour of your day vary as little as possible. A trusted routine can be extremely effective in helping you feel in control and non-reactive, which reduces anxiety and stress, and therefore makes you more mindful and competent. The bottom line is that how you start the day has an enormous effect on your overall effectiveness. At some point we all wonder, “Why is it so impossible to get everything done?” But the answer is stunningly simple: We’re doing too many of the wrong things. Every book ever written on productivity has shown that people never get more done by blindly working more hours on everything that comes up. Instead, they get more done when they follow careful plans that measure and track key priorities and milestones. So if you want to be more successful and less stressed, don’t ask how to make something more efficient until you’ve first asked, “Do I need to do this at all?” Simply being able to do something well does not make it the right thing to do. I think this is one of the most common problems with a lot of time-management advice; too often productivity gurus focus on how to do things efficiently, but a lot of things people do efficiently should not be done at all. If you think about it, it’s actually kind of ironic that we complain we have so little time, and then we prioritize like time is infinite. So do your best to focus on what’s truly important, and not much else. (Read “Getting Things Done”.) While everyone else is talking about it, successful people are quietly doing it. Remember, it doesn’t matter if you have a genius IQ and a PhD in Quantum Physics, you can’t change anything or make any sort of real-world progress without taking action. There’s a huge difference between knowing how to do something important and actually doing it. Knowledge and intelligence are mostly useless without action. It’s as simple as that. Successful people know that a good plan executed today is better than a perfect plan executed someday. They don’t wait for the “right time” or the “right day” or the “right (impossible) circumstances”, because they know these ideals are based on a fear and almost nothing more. They take action here and now, today — because that’s where real progress happens. Many of the most iconic novels, songs, and inventions of all time were inspired by gut-wrenching pain and heartbreak. Therefore the silver lining of these great challenges is that they were the catalyst to the creation of epic masterpieces. In fact, an emerging field of psychology called Post-Traumatic Growth has suggested that many people are able to use their hardships and traumas for substantial creative and intellectual development. Specifically, researchers have found that moderate trauma can help people grow in the areas of interpersonal relationships, contentment, gratitude, personal strength, and resourcefulness. When our view of the world as a safe place, or as a certain type of place, has been shattered, we are forced to reboot our perspective on things. We suddenly have the opportunity to look out to the periphery and see things with a new, fresh set of beginner’s eyes, which can be very conducive to personal growth and long-term success. (Note: Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Adversity” chapter of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.) You learn best when you’re stretching yourself beyond your previous level of comfort. Sure, getting into a routine is important. “Flow” is great too. But neither is the best way to learn. You want to be stretched to the edge of your ability sometimes too. It needs to be hard and uncomfortable for a little while because that’s how your brain grows. We learn when we’re in our discomfort zone, with boundaries. When you’re struggling to make something good happen, that’s often when you’re growing stronger and smarter. In other words, it’s better to spend an extremely high quality ten minutes growing, than it is to spend a mediocre hour running in place. You want to practice at the point where you are on the edge of your ability, stretching yourself slightly, over and over again, making little mistakes, stumbling, learning from those mistakes, and stretching yourself just slightly farther. Intuition is very real and something that is never wise to ignore, because it comes from deep within your subconscious and is derived from your previous life experiences. If someone else is telling you “yes” but your gut is telling you otherwise, it’s usually for a good reason. When faced with difficult decisions, seek out all the information you can find, become as knowledgeable as you possibly can, and then evaluate this information with your God-given instincts. Successful people know that trusting your intuition is equivalent to trusting your true self; and the more you trust your true self, the more control you have of making your goals and dreams come true. As described in the bestselling book “The Happiness Advantage”, recent scientific studies have shown that doctors who are put in a positive mood before making a diagnosis consistently experience significant boosts to their intellectual abilities than doctors in a neutral state, which allows them to make accurate diagnoses almost 20% faster. The same studies then shifted to other vocations and found that optimistic salespeople outsell their pessimistic counterparts by over 50%. Students primed to feel happy before taking math tests substantially outperform their neutral peers. So it turns out that our minds are literally hardwired to perform at their best not when they are negative, or even neutral, but when they are generally positive. Of course, that’s not to say that successful people never get upset, but your effectiveness in all walks of life will fare better if you’re able to mindfully accept and let go of negative emotions, rather than dwelling on them. Think a little less about managing your problems and a little more about managing your mindset. Keep it generally positive. You want to get in shape, but when you’re tired it’s easy to rationalize that you’ll start exercising and eating healthier tomorrow. You want to build a more profitable business, but when you’re caught up in the daily grind it’s easy to just do what’s familiar instead of what’s required for growth. You want to nurture your closest relationships, but when you’re busy it’s easy to rationalize that you really need to work on that client proposal instead. In other words, few good things come easy, and when the going gets tough we often take the easy way out — even though the easy way takes us the wrong way. To combat this, many successful people create tangible reminders that pull them back from the brink of their weak impulses. A friend of ours who has paid off over $100K of debt in the past five years has a copy of her credit card balance taped to her work computer’s monitor; it serves as a daily reminder of both the progress she has made and debt she still wants to pay off. Another friend keeps a photo of herself when she was 90 pounds heavier on her refrigerator as a reminder of the unhealthy lifestyle she never wants to go back to. And another fills his office bulletin board with family photos, both because he loves looking at them and because, when work gets really tough, these photos remind him of the people he is ultimately working for. Think of moments when you are most likely to give in to impulses that take you farther away from your ultimate goals. Then use visual reminders of those goals to interrupt the impulse and keep you on track. Taylor Swift keeps a journal. Oprah keeps a journal. Eminem keeps a journal. Enormously successful people typically track their progress, set goals, reflect, and learn from their mistakes. And they often use some kind journal to accomplish this. If you want to get somewhere in life, you need a map, and your journal is that map. You can write down what you did today, what you tried to accomplish, where you made mistakes, and so forth. It’s a place to reflect. It’s a place to capture important thoughts. It’s a place to be able to track where you’ve been and where you intend to go. And it’s one of the most underused, yet incredibly effective tools available to the masses. (Note: Marc and I build the small yet life-changing habit of journaling with our readers in “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts & Reflections to Start Every Day”.) Regardless of what you’re trying to achieve, you can’t do it completely alone. It can be hard to learn actionable skills from books, and sometimes the internet makes it difficult to separate truth from fiction. You need someone who has been where you want to go, and you need them to show you the way — you need a mentor. Sure, 10,000 hours of diligent practice can make you an expert at something, but what makes you dedicate 10,000 hours to something in the first place? The answer is having a great mentor or two. If you study the lives of enough successful people, it becomes obvious that most world-class performers in all fields — athletes, musicians, entrepreneurs, etc. — had incredible mentors, coaches or role models who made the activity of practice worthwhile and rewarding. And sometimes just observing a mentor works wonders too. When we observe someone we want to learn from and we have a crystal clear idea of what we want to create for ourselves, it unlocks a tremendous amount of motivation. Human beings are socially inclined, and when we get the idea that we want to join some elite circle up above us, that is what really motivates us to achieve greatness. “Look, they did it. I can do it too!” It may sound overly simplistic, but spending time studying people who are great can be one of the most powerful things you can do for your success. “To avoid criticism say nothing, do nothing, be nothing.” That’s what Aristotle said, and obviously he was being facetious. If you are being criticized for doing, saying or thinking something that’s a bit out of the ordinary, that could be really good news. Because it just might mean you’ve taken a stand for something sometime in your life recently, which is a huge part of being successful. Truth be told, you simply can’t base your idea of success and happiness on other people’s opinions and expectations. Follow in the footsteps of enormously successful people by learning to effectively process the criticism you receive. Hateful and negative criticism should be received, assessed, and then let go, while constructive criticism should be evaluated and acted upon. Solicit feedback from people whose opinions you value — people who have been where you want to go. And remember to be gracious when receiving feedback too, so the people around you feel heard, and will therefore be more likely to give you their support in the future. (Read The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.) Last but not least… To admit they made a mistake. To say they are sorry. To know that they can’t possibly know it all. To have big dreams without rigid expectations. To admit they owe their success to others too. To poke fun at themselves from time to time. To ask for help when they need it. To fail big, and to try again willingly… Most successful people know there are no permanent jobs or absolutes on this planet. We are all just interning and exploring here. So learn from everyone, remain humble, and swallow your pride when you must. It’s not giving up, it’s growing up and learning the way on the way. That’s what successful people do. Yes, it’s your turn to start putting the points above into action, one small and quiet step at a time. And if I were going to make a recommendation, I’d say start with just these two words: “Stretch” and “Observe.” Finally, remind yourself that you will never make real progress or change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret to your success is always found in your daily habits. And before you go, please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay. Your feedback is important to us. 🙂 Which one of the points above resonated the most today?

What you ultimately do in life comes out of who you believe you are. You have to practice believing in yourself and ignoring the naysayers. Because while you may not be able to control the impolite and unfair things some people say and do, you can press forward and decide not to be endlessly derailed by them. Of course, I know that’s all much easier said than done, but you must remind yourself that it can be done! How? Start by leveraging the right daily affirmations. After all, it’s not what others say about you, and it’s not what you broadcast to everyone else that determines the trajectory of your life. It’s what you whisper to yourself behind closed doors that has the greatest power and influence. A good friend of mine, who graduated with honors from Cal Berkley several years ago, is now the co-founder and CEO of a successful start-up in Silicon Valley. Throughout grade school she struggled with reading and writing disabilities. She spent kindergarten all the way through 12th grade in English “special education” classes. During a parent-teacher conference when she was a freshman in high school, two teachers collectively informed her mom that it was highly unlikely she would ever graduate. So how did she do it? How did she push through and overcome the odds? “Affirmations,” she told me with a serious smile when I interviewed her recently for a side-project I’m working on. “I literally told myself that they were wrong about me. I told myself exactly what I needed to hear, every single day, to move my life forward. It may sound like a cliché to some people, but it’s not. It’s powerful stuff!” I love her sentiment and I agree with her 100%. In fact, there’s a good reason why training our minds with affirmations works wonders like this. Just like every muscle in the body, the mind needs to be exercised to gain strength. It needs to be worked consistently to grow and develop over time. If you haven’t pushed your mind in hundreds of little positive ways over time, of course it’ll crumble on the one day that things get really challenging. A mind well trained with affirmations has the right thoughts queued up and ready for retrieval at a moment’s notice. If you’d like to begin (or enhance) this practice in your own life, here’s a selection of calming affirmations I often suggest to our coaching clients and live event attendees as starting point: And remember that the goal in the days and weeks ahead is to cope effectively — to gradually grow stronger on the inside — so that almost nothing on the outside can affect your inner wellness without your conscious permission… How you cope with unexpected stress and frustration can easily be the difference between living a good life and living an unhealthy one. My friend’s life story that I mentioned earlier is a great example of this. She chose healthy coping through affirmations, and you’d be wise to follow in her footsteps. But if you choose unhealthy coping mechanisms like avoidance or denial instead, you can quickly turn a tough situation into a tragic one. And sadly this is a common mistake many people make. When you find yourself facing a disheartening reality, your first reaction might be to deny the situation, or to avoid dealing with it altogether. But by doing so you’re inadvertently holding on even tighter to the pain that you wish to let go of — you’re, in effect, sealing it up inside you. Let’s imagine someone close to you has grown ill, and supporting this person through his or her illness is incredibly painful. You might not want to deal with the pain, so you cope by avoiding it, by finding ways to numb yourself with alcohol and unhealthy eating. And consequently, you grow physically ill too while the pain continues to fester inside you. Obviously that’s not good. If you notice yourself doing something similar, it’s time to pause, admit to yourself that you’re coping by avoiding, and then shift your focus to a more effective and healthier coping mechanism, like using the affirmations listed above to help calm your mind and open it up. When you face struggles with a calm attitude of openness — open to the painful feelings and emotions you have — you find out that it’s not comfortable, but you can still be fine and step forward. Openness like this means you don’t instantly decide that you know this is only going to be a horrible experience — it means you admit that you don’t really know what the next step will be like, and you’d like to understand the whole truth of the matter. It’s a calm learning stance, instead of one that frantically assumes the worst. Coping certainly isn’t an easy practice, and I’m not suggesting that it is. What I am suggesting is that it’s worth your while. With practice, effective coping allows you to find better ways of managing life’s continuous stream of unexpected and uncontrollable circumstances. For example… And of course, we’ve merely just scratched the surface of a deep pool of possibilities for effective coping. The key thing to understand is that by learning to internally cope more effectively, you are better equipped to handle anything life throws your way. Because in the end, the world is as you are inside — what you think, you see, and you ultimately become. Yes, it’s your turn to calm your mind and cope with life effectively.

Photo by: Peeratam Tangtua 10 Daily Habits that Often Drain 90 Percent of Our Joy|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-steal-your-happiness.jpg?resize=500%2C332&ssl=1| You ultimately become what you repeatedly do. If your habits aren’t helping you, they’re hurting you. Here are some fairly common and widespread examples of the latter that will drain all your joy if you let them: Try to use frustration and inconvenience to motivate you rather than annoy you. You are in control of the way you look at life. Instead of getting angry, find the lesson. In place of envy, feel admiration. In place of worry, take action. In place of doubt, have faith. Remember that your response is always more powerful than your present circumstance. A small part of your life is decided by completely uncontrollable circumstances, while the vast majority of your life is decided by your responses. Where you ultimately end up is heavily dependent on how you play the hands you’ve been dealt. Be selective with your energy today. If you can fix a problem, fix it. If you can’t, then accept it and change your thoughts about it. Whatever you do, don’t attempt to invest more energy than you have, tripping over something behind you or something that only exists inside your head. Truth be told, some of the most powerful moments in life happen when you find the courage to let go of what can’t be changed. Because when you are no longer able to change a situation, you are challenged to change yourself — to grow beyond the unchangeable. And that changes everything. You’re not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or even a week ago. You’re always learning and growing, and life is always evolving. Again, even though you can’t control everything that happens, you can control your attitude about what happens. And in doing so, you will gradually master change rather than allowing it to master you. So be humble today. Be teachable. The world is often bigger than your view of the world. There’s always room for a fresh idea or a next step. But first you must accept the fact that things may never go back to how they used to be, and that this ending is really a new beginning. Forgive yourself for the bad decisions you’ve made in the past, for the times you lacked understanding, for the choices that accidentally hurt others and yourself. Forgive yourself, for being young and reckless. These are all vital lessons. And what matters most right now is your willingness to grow from them. (Note: Marc and I discuss this further in the “Adversity” chapter of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.) There are thousands of people who live their entire lives on the default settings, never acknowledging the fact that they can customize everything. Don’t be one of them — don’t settle for the default settings on a daily basis. Don’t hide behind indecision or laziness either. And forget popularity! Just do your thing with passion, humility, and honesty. Do what you do, not for an applause, but because it’s what’s right. Pursue it a little bit each day, no matter what anyone else thinks. That’s how dreams are achieved. To make real progress in the long run you must let go of the assumption that you already have all the answers. So don’t stop learning! Don’t stop investing in yourself. Research. Read. Devour books. Engage with people, including those who think differently. Ask questions. Listen closely. And don’t just grow in knowledge. Be a person who gives back. Use what you’re learning to make a real and lasting difference. (Note: “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts and Reflections to Start Every Day” is a great tool for noticing and keeping track of all your lessons learned.) There are two variations of contentment in life — fleeting and enduring. The fleeting type is derived from instants of material comfort, while the enduring type is attained through the gradual growth and progress on matters that are truly important to you. At a quick glimpse it might be difficult to decipher one from the other, but as time rolls on it becomes vividly obvious that the latter is far superior. So just remember, if it entertains you now but will hurt or bore you someday, it’s a distraction. Don’t settle. Don’t exchange what you want most for what you kinda want at the moment. Study your routines. Figure out where your time goes, and remove distractions. It’s time to focus more on what matters in the long run. Don’t be so satisfied with the success stories of others and how things have gone for them, that you forget to write your own. Unfold your own tale and bring it to life on a daily basis. You have everything you need to become what you are capable of becoming. Incredible change happens when you decide to make yourself a priority. And remember, you won’t always be a priority to others, and that’s why you have to be a priority to yourself. Learn to respect yourself, take care of yourself, and become a daily part of your own support system. This means consuming less and creating more. It means refusing to let others do your thinking, talking, and deciding for you. It means learning to embrace and use your ideas and instincts to write your passage, one day at a time. Sometimes we literally have to fail dozens of times to succeed. And no matter how many mistakes you make or how slow you progress, you are still way ahead of everyone who isn’t trying. So don’t get so hung up on a few failed attempts that you miss the opening for a hundred more opportunities. All of your ideas that don’t work are simply stepping stones to the one idea that does. And remember, failure is not falling down; failure is staying down when you have the choice to get back up. Always get back up! Oftentimes good things fall apart in the near term so better things can fall together in the end. (Read Stumbling on Happiness.) Don’t buy into the myth of the perfect moment. Moments aren’t perfect, they’re what you make of them. So many people wait around for the stars to align to do what they’re here to do. The perfect moment, the perfect opportunity, the perfect state of being, etc. Wake up! Don’t “wait” away the vast majority of your life! Remind yourself that too many people wait all day for 5pm, all week for Friday, all year for the holidays, all their lives for happiness. And you don’t be one of them. Ultimately, you will come to succeed not by finding a perfect moment, but by learning to see and use life’s imperfections as stepping stones. If you feel a like you’ve wasted too much time and joy on one or more of the points above, this quick actionable closing exercise is for YOU. Choose any area in your life that you want to improve, and then: Yes, it’s your turn to not fall back into your old patterns of living simply because they’re more comfortable and easier to access. It’s your turn to remember that you’re leaving certain habits and situations behind for a reason: to improve your life — because you can’t move forward if you keep going back. And it’s undoubtedly your turn to reclaim your joy and make your time count going forward! But before you go, please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay.

Most of us are distracted from the get-go every morning. Trivial activities like checking social media, watching TV, and worrying about things we can’t control often set the tone of the day. And that means we waste our most well-rested time on things that don’t matter, while gradually losing touch with the significant, controllable parts of our lives that actually do matter. We simply forget that the morning hours are enormously important — they form the foundation from which the day is built. We forget that how we choose to spend these hours can be used to predict the kind of days we’re going to have, and ultimately the kind of lives we’re going to live. So if you feel like you’ve been getting a rough start lately, and stumbling through your days with diminished intention and focus, it’s time to consider some shifts… Before we get to the rituals, I’d be shocked if you haven’t been told to do these things in the past (I know Angel and I have preached about them numerous times in our weekly email newsletter). The problem is most of us slack off on the things we need to do for ourselves even though we know better. And Angel and I used to be just as unintentional with our morning hours as anyone else. We used to awake in a hurry and then move through our mornings at the mercy of whatever came up, stumbling into work and errands and client meetings in a fog. It was awful, but it was our morning routine. We didn’t know any different, so we didn’t think we could change things. Thankfully we were wrong. Angel and I gradually implemented the three morning rituals covered below and everything changed. Our mornings are now solid foundations from which we consistently yield positive results, and we’ve been going strong now for nearly two decades. In addition, we’ve helped hundreds of course students, coaching clients, and live event attendees implement these rituals in their lives too, and many of them have come back to us later to say, “Thank you!” My hope is that YOU find value in them as well. And please note how I mentioned “gradually” above. If you aren’t doing any of these things right now, start with just the first one, then add the second in a couple weeks, and then the third a few weeks after that… You are eating the most important meal of the day, right? Good. Now you can leverage your breakfast to strengthen your self-discipline. And self-discipline is a vital skill to be honed. It is the ability to overcome distractions and get the important things done. It involves acting according to what you know is right, instead of how you feel in the moment (perhaps tired or lazy or distracted by something else), which typically requires sacrificing immediate ease for what matters most in life. A lack of self-discipline for most of us is often the result of a lack of focus. In other words, we tell ourselves we are going to do something, but then we don’t. One of the easiest and most effective ways to build and maintain daily self-discipline? Start small every morning. Very small… Simply wash your dishes after breakfast. Yes, I mean literally washing your dishes with your own two hands. It’s just one tiny step forward every morning: When you eat your oatmeal, wash your bowl and spoon. When you finish drinking your morning coffee, rinse the coffee pot and your mug. Don’t leave any dirty dishes in the sink or on the counter for later. Wash them immediately. Form this ritual one dish at a time, one morning at a time. Once you do this consistently for a few weeks, you can start making sure the sink has been wiped clean too. Then the counter. Then make your bed. Pack yourself a healthy lunch. Start doing a few sit-ups. Meditate for a few minutes. And so forth (more on the latter two — exercise and meditation — below). Do one of these at a time each morning, and you’ll start to build a healthy ritual of self-discipline, and finally know yourself to be capable of doing what must be done, and finishing what you start. But, again, for the next few weeks, just wash your dishes after breakfast. Mindfully, with a smile. Exercise is the simplest and fastest way to change your life, not only because it strengthens your body, but because it also strengthens your mind. It’s a self-initiated activity that imposes a necessary level of mental and physical effort to fuel growth. And it almost instantaneously instills a positive sense of self-control into your subconscious, even when other circumstances in your life seem chaotic. In a vast world that is often well beyond your control, exercise becomes a personal space where you are able to train and regain mastery over your world. Only you can move your body. Only you can put one foot in front of the other. Only you get to decide how far you will push yourself. When you start your day like this — grounded and in control — the wider world is far easier to navigate. Furthermore, a consistent daily exercise ritual literally changes the physical inner-workings of your brain. In the bestselling book, Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain, Dr. John Ratey discusses data he collected through years of researching the neurological changes exercise causes in the brain. Exercise physically elevates a specific protein in the brain that Dr. Ratey calls “Miracle-Gro for the brain.” He states, “Exercise is the single most powerful tool you have to optimize your brain function. Aerobic activity has a dramatic effect on adaptation, regulating systems that might be out of balance and optimizing those that are not — it’s an indispensable tool for anyone who wants to reach his or her full potential.” Angel and I have come to very similar, although less scientific, conclusions on our own too. With over 15 years of experience working one-on-one (or two-on-one) with our course students and coaching clients, we have found that exercise truly is a universal medicine to nearly all human mental ailments. It drastically reduces mild and moderate depression, lowers anxiety, counterbalances the negative effects of being overstressed, and more. And the best part is that exercise is obviously not just a mental workout, but a physical one as well — you’re hitting two birds with one stone. So if exercise is that wonderful, why am I recommending only 15 minutes of it each morning? Because in the beginning that’s enough without being too much. Starting small is important. I’m sure you’ve heard this before, but again, so many of us forget to follow good advice. Start with a morning ritual of exercise that lasts 15 minutes or less. If you feel incredible resistance and fail at 15 minutes, drop it to 10 minutes, or 7 minutes, and then stick to it for at least a full month before increasing the duration again. The same principle of starting small that we just discussed above applies here as well. With that said however, a morning meditation ritual of only 15 minutes is no easy feat for most beginners. During the first several attempts at meditation, most novice meditators tend to find it near impossible to quiet their mind. Because of this, many of us try meditation once or twice and do not see the value in it — it does not immediately instill the same sense of control over that exercise does. But with practice and patience meditation can be far more powerful. And that’s why Angel and I meditate every morning for 15 minutes. Meditation is indeed a vital morning ritual in our lives, and in the lives of hundreds of students and clients we’ve worked with over the years. While it may not as easily instill the level of control that exercise does, meditation provides a deeper level of control which ultimately brings out of us what has been stuck inside — it connects us with our truest selves by allowing us to access all the areas of our mind and body that we are usually distracted and disconnected from. Details aside, the most basic and practical benefits of meditation are twofold: And when we bring a more relaxed presence into our morning hours — into the foundation of our day — it makes everything that happens from there much easier to deal with. Because we take the next step more mindfully — without pent-up resistance — fully aware and accepting of the tenseness in our shoulders, the little bubble of hope in our heart, or maybe even the haze of sadness in the back of our mind. And with this awareness and acceptance we find better solutions, healthier ways to cope, and a general sense that people are friendlier and cats purr louder. On the contrary, when we are stressed out and distracted in the morning hours, our mind is split and frayed. One part is firmly focused on whatever is pressing in upon us, while the other part is giving minimal attention to whatever tasks need to be done quickly in the meantime. Let me give you an example (from my own past life) to make things clear. Imagine that you are late for work and you’re rushing around your house in preparation to leave. If a loved one starts telling you something important about what they are going to do today, how much of your attention is going to be focused on what they are telling you? Not much. But when we become more present — when we gradually establish more awareness and acceptance of the present moment through meditation — we stop being as distracted and preoccupied. In the space that opens for a moment, we can breathe deeply and listen deeply. For a moment, stress slips off our shoulders. And with practice we can learn to have more and more moments like this in our life. A course student of ours recently wrote (shared with permission): “Every moment is a new opportunity. The next one is as fresh and full of promise as the thousand before that you missed, and it is completely empty of any judgment whatsoever. Nothing is carried over that you take with you. You don’t have to pass a good-person exam before you enter, it is totally unconditional. It’s as if it is saying… ‘Okay, so you missed me the last 10,000 moments, but look! Here I am again… and again… and again!’ And you are welcomed with open arms.” Here’s how to establish presence through morning meditation (note that there are many meditation techniques, this is the one Angel and I are presently practicing): Sit upright in a chair with your feet on the ground and your hands resting comfortably on your lap, close your eyes, and focus on your breathing for 15 minutes (or less in the beginning if 15 minutes feels like too much). The goal is to spend the entire time focused only on the feeling of your chest inhaling and exhaling, which will prevent your worried mind from wandering and overthinking. This sounds simple, but again, it’s challenging to do for more than a couple minutes, especially when you’re just starting out with this ritual. And it’s perfectly fine if random thoughts sidetrack you — this is sure to happen, you just need to bring your focus back to your breathing. Remember that the three morning rituals above mean nothing if they are not acted upon consistently. One morning of cleaning your dishes, exercising, and meditation by itself won’t cut it. It is the compound effect of simple, seemingly mundane actions over time that leads to life-altering, positive results. For example, there’s nothing exciting about putting one foot in front of the other every day for weeks, but by doing so, many normal human beings have climbed over 29,000 feet to the top of the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest… And there is nothing exciting about cleaning dishes, exercising, or sitting quietly in meditation for a short time every morning, but by doing so, Angel and I (and hundreds of students and clients we’ve worked with) have drastically better lives. Just like every muscle in the body, the mind needs to be trained to gain strength. It needs to be worked consistently to grow and develop over time. Which is exactly what the three morning rituals in this post allow you to do. If you don’t proactively push yourself in little ways every morning, of course you’ll crumble later on in the day when something doesn’t go your way. You have a choice! Choose to clean your dishes when it would be easier to leave them in the sink. Choose to exercise when it would be easier to sleep in. Choose to meditate when it would be easier to distract yourself with something else. Prove to yourself, in little ways every morning, that you have the power to take control of your day and your life! (Note: Angel and I also build tiny, actionable, life-changing daily rituals with our readers in our New York Times bestseller, “Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs”.) Yes it’s your turn to focus on the tiny morning rituals that can help you grow. And before you go, please leave Angel and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay.

And likewise, as we age we are often guilty of being so busy-brained that we forget what it was like to be young. Spending time with my young son helps me tap into my younger mind — he keeps me on my toes. For that I am grateful, but I still struggle as a parent. I struggle to be present. I struggle to be patient. I struggle to remember. Almost every single day. Truth be told, every parent battles with parenthood in their own way. Because parenting is not easy. What helps me is journaling about the lessons parenthood is gradually teaching me, and then referring back to what I’ve learned when I’m struggling and forgetful. Today, I want to share some quotes from my parenting journal with you. Perhaps they will assist you someday, the way they have assisted me again this morning… I want to end this post with a famous quote by Walt Disney that I’ve always loved: “Children are people, and they should have to reach to learn about things, to understand things, just as adults have to reach if they want to grow in mental stature. Life is composed of lights and shadows, and we would be untruthful, insincere, and saccharine if we tried to pretend there were no shadows. Most things are good, and they are the strongest things; but there are evil things too, and you are not doing a child a favor by trying to shield him or her from reality. The important thing is to teach a child that good can always triumph over evil.” Marc and I would love to hear from YOU before you go. Please leave us a comment below to let us know what you think of this post and its advice. Did you have a favorite quote or point? Anything else to share about parenting?

"16 Life Choices You Shouldn’t Have to Justify to Anyone Else|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/16-justify-anyone.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| You don’t need to justify anything. You don’t need to change just so someone will like you. Be your best self and the right ones will love the real you. Your life is yours alone. Others can try to persuade you, but they can’t decide for you. They can walk with you, but not in your shoes. So make sure the path you decide to walk aligns with your own intuition and desires, and don’t be scared to walk alone and pave your own path when you know it’s the right thing to do. Will the people in your life always support your decisions? No they likely won’t. But you need to remember that life is not about justifying yourself — it’s about creating yourself. So make this your lifelong motto: “I respectfully do not care.” Say it to anyone who passes unfair judgment on something you strongly believe in or something that makes you who you are. People will inevitable judge you at some point anyway, and that’s OK. You affected their life; don’t let them affect yours. And when you need a quick reminder or a dose of encouragement, refer to this quick reference list of life choices you shouldn’t have to justify to anyone else: During a television interview back when she was the First Lady, Michelle Obama was asked if she thought it was at all selfish that she openly admits to making herself her first priority. The First Lady smiled and replied, “No, not at all. It’s practical… a lot of times we just slip pretty low on our own priority list because we’re so busy caring for everyone else. And one of the things that I want to model for my children is investing in themselves as much as they invest in others.” Like her or not, that’s spot on advice if you ask me! There are only a few people in this world who will stay 100% true to you, and YOU should be one of them. Prioritize your own needs into your daily to-do’s. Never apologize for being sensitive or emotional. There’s no reason to be ashamed of feeling something or expressing it if it’s real to you. Showing your emotions is characteristic of a truly alive and compassionate human being, and yet it’s too often perceived as a sign of being weak or broken. Truly, it’s not the emotionally sensitive person who is broken, it’s society’s understanding that is oftentimes dysfunctional and emotionally incapacitated. Truly, there is zero shame in expressing your authentic feelings. Those who are at times described as being “too emotional” or “complicated” are the very fabric of what keeps the dream alive for a more thoughtful, caring, humane world. Let your feelings, smiles, and tears shine a light in this world! We are all weird in some way. What sets you apart may seem like a burden, but it’s not. Most of the time it’s what makes you so incredible. So where’s your will to be weird? Where’s your resolution to be real? Celebrate your individuality and do not be embarrassed of it. If you’re lucky enough to have something that makes you different from everybody else, don’t be ashamed and don’t hide it. Own it! (Read The Gifts of Imperfection.) We are never more alive than when we are being brave, and we can’t be brave unless we are willing to take off our masks and be ourselves. It’s about finding the courage to be imperfectly yourself. When perfectionism of any kind is driving us, shame is always riding shotgun and fear is the backseat driver. Don’t do this to yourself. Let go of that subconscious pull to be “perfect” in the eyes of others, and just be exactly who you are today. No apologies required. You may not be able control all the rude things people say and do, but you can decide not to be controlled by them. Make that decision for yourself. There is great freedom in leaving others to their opinions. And there is a huge weight lifted when you take things less personally. Of course, some people may tell you it’s best to stand up tall for yourself and fight back hard, but the best offense is usually a good defense. Defend yourself from others by not putting yourself at the center of their inner conflicts. Truth be told, if you take everything personally, you will remain offended for the rest of your life. What other people do is mostly because of them, not you. Forgive others, not because they deserve forgiveness, but because you deserve peace. Free yourself of the burden of being an eternal victim. For the most part, grudges are for those who insist that they are owed something. Forgiveness on the other hand is for those who are wise enough to focus on what they can control in the present. In order to move forward, you must know why you felt the way you did, and why you no longer need to feel that way. It’s about accepting the past, setting healthy boundaries, and lifting your spirit with positive steps forward. Although it’s perhaps conceivable that you may lie on your deathbed someday regretting that you didn’t work harder and check every little thing off your to-do list, it’s doubtful that your work and to-dos will be your biggest concerns. What’s more likely, however, is that you will wish you could have one more romantic night with your spouse, another long, heartfelt talk with your sister or brother, and one last laugh with your best friend. The bottom line is that life is too short to be too busy for the people you love. You are not behind. You are exactly where you need to be. Every step is necessary. Don’t judge or berate yourself for how long your journey is taking. We all need our own time to travel our own distance. In fact, two of the most amazing couples I know didn’t meet each other until they were in their late 30’s. One of these couples just had their first child in their early 40’s. The lesson here is simple: Great things in life don’t happen when society tells you they’re supposed to happen — they happen when the time and conditions are right. So remember, you don’t have to make excuses about why you aren’t married right now, or working a traditional 8-5 job, or making a certain amount of money, etc. Our lives are not all meant to be scripted the same exact way. In those moments when you find yourself standing face to face with an issue you battled before — one bearing a lesson you were sure you’d already learned — remember, repetition is not failure. Ask the waves, ask the leaves, ask the wind. Repetition is required to evolve and grow. And repetition allows you to fail forward. We learn the right way on the way. Truly, failures are opportunities to begin again smarter than before. If you’ve heard differently, forget what others have told you. Fail often, fail fast, clean it up, learn from it, move on, and then repeat. Just because things didn’t work out for you today, doesn’t mean there’s not something big in store for you tomorrow. Rest easy and get ready. Don’t waste your energy justifying your next step to the naysayers. I don’t entirely approve of some of the things I’ve done in my life. But I am who I am. And I would not be me if I hadn’t learned along the way. The same is true for you. Don’t be ashamed of who you had to be to get to where you are today. Forgive yourself for those times when you lacked clarity, for those foolish decisions you made that caused needless stress. Forgive yourself for being human, young, and reckless. Your journey has many vital lessons. And what matters most now is your willingness to grow from them. Angel and I have helped hundreds of coaching clients overcome self-esteem issues, and physical appearance almost always has something to do with it. As a client we coached this morning put it, “Whenever I leave the house looking anything less than airbrushed and fashionable and then run into someone I know, I tend to feel the need to apologize for not looking a certain way.” That’s ludicrous! You don’t have to apologize to everyone for not looking a certain way. You could apologize to yourself though, for feeling like you had to in the first place. Too often our culture associates healthy eating habits with fad diets and weight loss marketing schemes. But there’s also something called healthy eating as a means to actual good health, not weight loss, not some crazy diet, or anything else. Why do we need to stand up for ourselves when we choose to eat healthy? Because for some reason some people tend to be skeptical that a person would actually just want to treat their body right and not be perpetually concerned with their shape and size. Eat healthy because it’s good for your health. Ignore the critics! When people try to inspire you, they’ll often tell you all kinds of well-meaning and heartfelt things like: “Follow your dreams. Listen to your heart. Find your inner voice and let it sing. In fact, dream and don’t stop dreaming until all of your dreams come true.” And while all of this is fine and dandy, the big problem is a lot of people dream and dream… and that’s all they do. Don’t be one of them! It’s always easier said than done, yet you need to do some hard things to be happy in life. Because the hard things ultimately build you up and move you forward. They make the difference between existing and living, between knowing the path and walking it, between a lifetime of empty dreams and a life filled with gratitude for how far you’ve come. Positivity does not mean ignoring the negativity around you, it means overcoming the negativity within you. There is a big difference between the two. The peace, happiness, and effectiveness of your life greatly depends on the quality of your thoughts. Of course, not every day will be good, but there will be something good about every day. Do your best to notice it. None of us know the exact paths we will travel or the trials that will come our way. The secret is to find some goodness on the daily journey. Making the best of each step you take is the smartest choice. Your positivity will gradually help you realize that many of the inconvenient things that happen in your life are on the same path to the best possible things that could ever happen to you. (Note: Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Adversity” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. I couldn’t agree more. We all do a lot of talking about the importance of the first two, but don’t forget to nurture your hope too. And remember, hope isn’t the belief that life will always give you what you want; it’s the belief that life will gradually reveal what’s right for you. You don’t need a standing ovation or a bestseller or a promotion or a million bucks. You are enough right now. You have nothing to justify. Care less about who you are to others and more about who you are to yourself. You will have fewer heartaches and disappointments the minute you stop seeking from others the justification only YOU can give yourself. Bottom line: Constantly trying to justify yourself to everyone else forces you to miss out on the beauty of simply being yourself, with your own unique ideas, desires, and life experiences. If you are led through life only doing and being what you’ve come to believe is expected of you, then, in a way, you cease to live… you merely exist. Do more than exist! We all exist. The question is: How do you want to live today? (Note: This is a question Angel and I ask ourselves every morning, and it’s one of 365 thought-provoking prompts included in our newest publication via Penguin Random House, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts & Reflections to Start Every Day”.) Yes, it’s your turn to get out there and live today! (No justifications needed.) But before you go we would love to hear from YOU. Which point mentioned above resonates with you the most right now?

I chose to interview my dad. He was 53 at the time and he gave me 18 pieces of advice. I had completely forgotten about all of this until last week when I was visiting my parents. My mom had me clean out a few old boxes stored in the attic. In one of these boxes I found the original “Advice for a Younger Generation” assignment dated April 22nd, 1996. I read through it and was admittedly blown away — there’s lots of solid wisdom within. Even though my dad’s advice is generally relevant to a person of any age, my 41-year-old self can relate to it in a way my 14-year-old self didn’t quite grasp at the time. In fact, the first thought that went through my head was, “Wow, my dad was right!” Here are his 18 pieces of advice for a younger generation, transcribed with his permission. Adults are just older children. When you get older you won’t feel as old as you imagine you will. For the most part, you still feel exactly the way you feel right now, just a little wiser and more confident. You’ve had time to establish your place in the world and figure out what’s important to you. Don’t fear growing up. Look forward to it. It’s awesome! Part of living and growing up is experiencing unexpected troubles in life. People lose jobs, get in car accidents, and sometimes die. When you are younger, and things are going pretty well, this harsh reality can be hard to visualize. The smartest and oftentimes hardest thing we can do in these kinds of situations is to be tempered in our reactions. To want to scream obscenities, but to be wiser and more disciplined than that. To remember that emotional rage only makes matters worse. And to remember that tragedies are rarely as bad as they seem, and even when they are, they give us an opportunity to grow stronger. Making one person smile can change the world. Maybe not the whole world, but their world. So start small and start now. Be patient. Be present. Be kind. Compliment people. Magnify their strengths, not their weaknesses. This is how to make a difference, in your own life above all, and in all the lives you touch. Everyone and everything seems normal from a distance, or at a glance. The 10th, 20th, or even the 50th impression is when you start to truly understand someone else for who they truly are. Be patient and present. Pay attention to their habits and rituals. We are what we habitually do. Concentrate your efforts on smaller and smaller areas. Specialize. When your efforts are diffused over a wide area they won’t have much of an impact. So focus on smaller areas and your efforts will be felt more fully. It could take time for growth to happen, but keep that focus narrow and the results will come in time. Strive to be the “you” you want to be. Nourish your mind and body. Don’t stop learning. Educate yourself every day until you die. Study. Read. Devour new ideas. Engage with people, including those who think differently. Ask questions. Listen. And don’t just grow in knowledge. Be a person who gives back too. Put your uncertainty and fears aside for a second and ask yourself this: “If I try and I don’t get it right the first time, what will I have lost and what will I have gained?” The answer is: You will have lost nothing but a little bit of your time while gaining an important lesson that will help you get it right the second or third time. People rarely get it right the first time. In fact, usually the only people who ever get it right are those who continue going for it even when they’ve come up short numerous times before. Supporting, guiding, and making contributions to other people is one of life’s greatest rewards. Almost everything you do comes back around in some way. Let your actions create positive ripples in your life. If you can avoid it, don’t fight. Step back from arguments with your spouse, family members, or neighbors. When you feel anger surging up and you want to yell that vulgar remark on the tip of your tongue, just close your mouth and take a break. Sleep on it. Give yourself space. Let calmness be your superpower, and then revisit the situation if you must. You don’t have to be right or win an argument immediately. Purposely impressing people is an act that brings nothing but a momentary ego boost. Be real with people instead. Connect with fewer people on a level that is deeper and more profound. Fun is way underrated! With all of life’s responsibilities, fun will sometimes seem like an indulgence. It shouldn’t be. It should be a requirement. Make time for fun and casual play. Schedule it in until the day you die! There is a world of magnificence hidden in simplicity. Identify the five most important things in your life now and focus on those things in your free time. Let the other stuff go. Stop the senseless busyness most people fill their lives with, so you can enjoy what’s truly important to you. So pay attention to them. Like watching your child sleep. Preparing a holiday meal with your family. Sharing a great laugh with an old friend. This is the real stuff life is made of. Tune in. Most people don’t need lots of advice, they need to live. I’ve seen young, rocky relationships develop into wonderful marriages, and I’ve seen fleeting inspirations ignite a lifetime of passion and happiness. Our life stories, like the answers we give to long essay questions, are uniquely ours. What people want to know is already somewhere inside of them. We all just need time to think, be, and continue to explore the imperfect journeys that will eventually help us find our long-term direction. Your situation and environment is ever changing, so be careful not to confuse things that are urgent with things that are important. Evaluate your obligations on a monthly basis and be willing to make necessary shifts. And remember that good, admirable obligations, like volunteering at church, will sometimes need to be put on hold temporarily for something else. And that’s OK. You can’t do it all. Don’t buy stuff you don’t need.  Don’t spend more than you make.  Don’t spend to impress people. Don’t let your money manage you in the long run. Financial stability is peace of mind when you get older. While you may not use the specifics of every classroom lesson, every lesson does expand the core thought process of your mind. Over time you will develop problem-solving skills that are universally applicable. No single classroom lesson can teach this, and no single classroom lesson is more important. Don’t dream about it anymore. Start doing it a little bit every day. In 40 years from now, what is it that you will regret not having accomplished, appreciated, or attempted? Do it, appreciate it, and attempt it starting NOW! My dad is 80-years-old now, and although he says he generally agrees with all of his younger self’s advice, I’m sure he’s learned a few new tricks over the past twenty-seven years. So earlier today as I was transcribing this, I asked him if he would share a few of these new tricks with us. He said he will in the near future, so sign up for our email updates and stand by for a new article from him. 🙂 But in the mean time, he told me to tell you to read his three favorite personal development books: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, The Millionaire Next Door, and 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently (yes, he shamelessly plugged our book, but he actually re-reads it for daily self-reflection, so it’s legitimate). Finally, before you go, please leave my dad (and Angel and me) a comment below to let us know what you think of this article and its advice. Your feedback is truly important to us. Photo by: Alex Proimos 12 Empowering Reminders We Need to Read Every Morning for the Rest of the Year|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/12-morning-reminders.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| 5 Brutal Lessons that Ultimately Make Life Beautiful|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-make-life-beautiful.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| The most common reason for our collective suffering on an average day is our resistance to the truth. Sometimes it’s brutally hard to accept life’s greatest lessons, and yet we must. Because it’s lessons like these that ultimately make our lives beautiful, by showing us how to thrive even through the toughest of times: You can never read all the books you want to read. You can never train yourself in all the skill sets you want to have. You can never be all the things you want to be and live all the lives you want to live. You can never spend all the time you want with the people you love. You can never feel every possible temperature, tone, and variation of emotion in a given situation. You are incredibly limited, just like everyone else. In the game of life, we all receive a unique set of unexpected limitations and variables in the field of play. The question is: How will you respond to the hand you’ve been dealt? You can either focus on the lack thereof or empower yourself to play the game sensibly and resourcefully, making the very best of every outcome as it arises, even when it’s heartbreaking and hard to accept. In the end, what matters most is to focus on what matters most. By doing so you get to truly experience the various sources of beauty and opportunity in your life while each of them lasts. Let’s take a moment and revisit the notion of being limited by the reality of not being able to spend all the time you want with someone you love. When someone you love passes away too soon, that’s undoubtedly one of the most heartbreaking limitations to cope with, and the general principles for coping with this kind of tragic limitation is universally applicable to less severe situations too… Imagine a person who gave meaning to your life is suddenly no longer in your life (at least not in the flesh), and you’re not the same person without them. You have to change who you are — you’re now a best friend who sits alone, a widow instead of a wife, a dad without a daughter, or a next-door neighbor to someone new. You want life to be the way it was, before death, but it never will be. Marc and I have dealt with the loss of siblings and best friends to illness, so we know from experience that when you lose someone you can’t imagine living without, your heart breaks wide open. And the bad news is you never completely get over the loss – you will never forget them. However, in a backwards way, this is also the good news. You see, death is an ending, which is a necessary part of living. And endings are necessary for beauty too — otherwise it’s impossible to appreciate someone or something, because they are unlimited. Limits illuminate beauty, and death is the definitive limit — a reminder that you need to be aware of this beautiful person or situation, and appreciate this beautiful thing called life. Death is also a beginning, because while you’ve lost someone special, this ending, like every loss, is a moment of reinvention. Although sad, their passing forces you to reinvent your life, and in this reinvention is an opportunity to experience beauty in new, unseen ways and places. And finally, of course, death is an opportunity to celebrate a person’s life, and to be grateful for the priceless beauty they showed you. Eventually, most of us end up settling in some part of our life. We let go of certain ideals and dreams, we compromise, and we make trade-offs. We gradually learn that we can’t have everything we want, because not every outcome in life can be perfectly controlled. But if we pay close attention, we also learn that we can make the best of every outcome, and still get a lot of what we want in life, if we manage our time, energy and attitude appropriately. And these realizations collectively lead to an interesting question: When should you settle, or compromise, and when should you continue fighting hard for what you ideally want to achieve? There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, but when you encounter a situation that forces you to choose between compromise and fighting forward against the opposition, it might help to also ask yourself: “Do I really need this, or do I just kinda want it?” Being able to distinguish needs from wants is essential in every walk of life. Never let go of an outcome you truly need in your life, but be reasonably flexible on the outcomes you want but could live fine without. In other words, choose your battles wisely, and don’t let ‘perfect’ become the enemy of ‘great.’ Remind yourself that what you pay attention to grows. So focus on what really matters and let go of what does not. Don’t give up 50% of your life working 50-hour weeks at a day job that makes you absolutely miserable. Don’t abandon your sanity for the wrong reasons. Don’t neglect lifelong goals and dreams that have withstood the tests of time, and still bring incredible meaning into your life. If you really need something, fight hard for it! But for everything else, let go a little. Loosen your grip, compromise… settle. Settle on less of the unessential, to get more of what you really need and want in life. Most people want the reward without the risk. The shine without the grind. But you can’t have a destination without a journey. And a journey always has costs – at the very least, you have to invest your time and energy into it every step of the way. So, instead of thinking about what you want, first ask yourself: “What am I willing to give up to get it?” Or, for those inevitably hard days: “What is worth suffering for?” Seriously, think about it… If you want the tight and sexy abs, you have to want the sore muscles, the sweaty clothes, the mornings or afternoons of exercise, and the healthy meals. If you want the successful business, you have to also want the longer days, the stressful business deals and decisions, and the likelihood of failing a few times to learn what you need to know to succeed in the long run. But if you catch yourself wanting something day in and day out, month after month, yet you never take action and thus you never make any progress, then maybe you don’t really want it after all, because you’re not willing to suffer through the effort and work it’s going to take to achieve it. But if you decide that you DO want it, then take a long, hard look at your daily routines and rituals, and ask yourself another question: “Based on my daily routines and rituals, where can I expect to be in a year from now?” This question can be helpful because if you have an idea about what you want the next chapter of your life to look like, you have to consistently DO things that support this idea. An idea, after all, isn’t going to do anything for you until you do something productive with it. In fact, as long as that great idea is just sitting around in your head it’s doing far more harm than good. Your subconscious mind knows you’re procrastinating on something that’s important to you. The required work that you keep postponing causes stress, anxiety, fear, and usually more procrastination — a vicious cycle that continues to worsen until you interrupt it with positive ACTION. “I don’t think others like me. They like versions of me that I have somehow spun for them… versions of me that they have invented in their minds… versions of me with only the characteristics that are easy to like. But that’s not who I really am. And it scares me. After all, who’s going to like the girl that can’t stop second-guessing herself? The girl that cries? The girl that’s losing control? The girl that hides from her problems? The girl that keeps pushing everyone away? Who’s going to like the weakness in me… who’s going to like the real me?” I wrote those lines in my journal fifteen years ago when I was struggling through a mild bout of depression. What gradually healed me was my willingness to own my truth and be openly vulnerable about it. Doing so, of course, isn’t easy. Being vulnerable means accepting who you are and having the courage to share it with the world. To show up, not as who you think you should be or who you want people to think you are, but as the real YOU, and to be open and welcoming to however the world responds. It’s risky, but not nearly as hazardous as giving up on true love and honesty and acceptance — the priceless experiences that make us the most vulnerable. Only when we are brave enough to explore the dark corners of ourselves will we discover the hidden power of our inner light. So please remember, no matter what age, race or sex you are, underneath all your external decorations you are a pure, beautiful being. You have light to shine, and missions to accomplish. Celebrate being different, off the beaten path, a little on the weird side, your own special creation. If you find yourself feeling like a fish out of water, by all means find a new stream to swim in. But don’t deny yourself — embrace yourself! Be YOU in a world that’s trying to influence every move you make. Take the road less traveled when it feels right under your feet. Do more than just exist. We all exist. The question is: Do you live? Own your truth. Learn from it. And LIVE! (Note: Marc and I build actionable rituals for truly LIVING with our students in the “Happiness & Positive Living” module of the Getting Back to Happy Course, and we also explore this theme through the power of journaling in our newest publication with Penguin Random House, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts & Reflections to Start Every Day”.) “It was just a mistake,” he said. But the really painful thing was, it felt like the biggest mistake was mine, for trusting him. Can you relate in any way? I’m sure you can. Eventually, every one of us suffers from some kind of heart-wrenching betrayal. And in a backwards way, it’s what unites us. When it happens to you, the key is to not let one person’s despicable decisions destroy your trust in everyone else. Don’t let them take that from you. Trust is essential to building and maintaining deep and meaningful connections — it’s the foundation for all healthy relationships. Rebuilding trust after betrayal though is rarely easy, and sometimes not even appropriate with the person who betrayed you. But regardless of the details and what you ultimately decide to do with that particular relationship, the most important decision is who YOU decide to be after a betrayal. Do your best to be resourceful. Remind yourself that distancing yourself from someone who keeps giving you negative vibes or unhealthy energy is self-care. Stepping back from situations where you feel unappreciated or disrespected is self-care. Choose to honor your feelings and boundaries, respectfully. In the end, people will come in and out of your life for different purposes and periods of time. Every one of them can be a teacher if you are willing to learn. Some lessons are far more painful than others, but all have the power to add to your strength of character. By processing a betrayal resourcefully, you are mining that experience for the pearls it holds so you can let go of the rest gradually over time. The bottom line is that some people will only be there for you as long as you have something they need. When you no longer serve a purpose to them, they will leave. The good news is, if you tough it out, you’ll eventually weed these people out of your life and be left with some great people you can count on. So just keep doing your best to spend time with nice people who are smart, driven and like-minded. Relationships should help you, not hurt you. Surround yourself with people who reflect the person you want to be. Choose friends who you are proud to know, people you admire, who love and respect you— people who make your day a little brighter simply by being in it. (Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) If you only remember two words from this whole article, let them be: “Learn” and “Believe.” Learn: As in… learn through experience. Learn from others. Remain humble, open-minded, and teachable. Put yourself out there and let it all sink it. Then gently push yourself to the edge of your comfort zone, so you can expand it and grow a little more confident every day. Believe: As in… believe in yourself and your ability to succeed. Believe in your intuition, especially when you have to choose between two good paths. Believe that the answers are out there waiting. Believe that life will surprise you again and again. Believe that the journey is the destination. Believe that it’s all worth your while. Believe that you are confident enough to see it through. Yes, it’s your turn to learn and believe today! But before you go, please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this post.

"12 Simple Ways to Love Yourself Again in the Year Ahead|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/16-love-yourself.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| 10 Quotes and Notes You Need to Read 10 Times a Day Until You Feel Stronger|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-notes-to-self.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| Happiness doesn’t start with a relationship, a vacation, a job, or money. It starts with your thinking and what you tell yourself on a daily basis. The best lessons we learn in life are the lessons we learn over and over again. The human mind needs lots of reminders — lots of practice — to operate effectively. For example, deep down we know it’s OK to… Yet, we often seek the exact opposite when life gets stressful and we’re under pressure. We do the wrong things even when we know better. Because, the human mind has weaknesses. It becomes forgetful and insensible when it’s stressed. And the only way to conquer these weaknesses is to practice conquering them. Remember, the mind is like a muscle, and just like every muscle in the human body, it needs to be exercised to gain and maintain strength. It needs to be trained daily to grow and develop gradually over time. If you haven’t pushed the mind in lots of little, positive ways over the course of time, of course it’ll crumble on the inevitable days that get overwhelmingly stressful. The easiest strategy to practice strengthening the mind? It’s all about keeping the right thoughts at the top of your mind every day, so they’re readily available on those inevitable days when you need them most. For Angel and me, that means pausing every day, as often as necessary, and reflecting on precisely what we need to remember.  We write ourselves important visual reminders — our “notes to self” — like the ones below and then we place them where we can easily see and reference them throughout the day (my notes are taped on the wall directly in front of my desk, and then I have one as the wallpaper background on my phone). Some people call them affirmations, or quotes, or prayers, on convictions, but in any case, these “notes to self” keep us on track by keeping our minds empowered with positive, peaceful trains of thought, even when life gets utterly hectic. Through this daily training — this visual practice — Angel and I have ultimately learned that peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble, or hard realities to deal with; peace means to be in the midst of all those things and still be capable of maintaining a calm, collected mind. To an extent, I know you’ve learned something similar over the years from your own life experiences. But just like us, you often forget. And that’s precisely why we have our “notes to self.” So my challenge to YOU is to start practicing alongside us today. To get started, steal our “notes to self” below — perhaps just the ones that resonate most — and place them somewhere you can see them. Then, whenever you catch yourself feeling overly stressed out, pause for a minute and quietly read them to yourself. See how doing so gradually changes the way you think through life’s twists and turns and potholes. (Note: For the sake of not being tediously redundant, I only wrote “NOTE TO SELF” as a precursor on the first note below. But you can use this precursor on all your notes if you like — some of our course students and live event attendees have told us they find the precursor to be a helpful visual hook, especially when they have their notes spaced out in different physical or digital locations.) 1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  8.  9.  10.  Written “notes to self” like the ones above are powerful, but they merely scratch the surface of possibilities for beneficial visual reminders. For instance, I have my laptop’s desktop background set to a photo of my family, both because I love looking at them and because, when work gets really tough, these photos remind me of the people I am ultimately working for. It’s so simple, but it helps. I also know dozens of other people who successfully use similar visual reminders on a daily basis. A student of ours who has paid off nearly $100K of debt in the past five years has a copy of his credit card balance taped to his computer monitor at home; it serves as a constant reminder of the debt he still wants to pay off. Another student keeps a photo of herself when she was 90 pounds heavier on her refrigerator as a reminder of the person she never wants to be again. Think of moments when you are most likely to give in to impulses that keep you stuck and take you farther away from your ultimate goals. Then use written “notes to self” and visual reminders of your goals to interrupt those negative impulses and keep yourself on track. If you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU. Which reminder — or “note to self” — mentioned above resonates with you the most today, and why? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

You don’t need other people to validate you; you are already VALUABLE. Sometimes we try to show the world we are flawless in hopes that we will be liked and accepted by everyone, but we can’t please everyone and we shouldn’t try. The beauty of us lies in our vulnerability, our complex emotions, and our authentic imperfections. When we embrace who we are and decide to be authentic, instead of who we think others want us to be, we open ourselves up to real relationships, real happiness, and real success. There is no need to put on an act. There is no need to pretend to be someone you’re not. You have nothing to prove to anyone else, because… In the long run, it’s better to be loathed for who you are than loved for who you are not. In fact, the only relationships that work well in the long run are the ones that make you a better person without changing you into someone other than yourself, and without preventing you from outgrowing the person you used to be. Ignore the comparisons and expectations knocking at your door. The only person you should try to be better than is the person you were yesterday. Prove yourself to yourself, not others. The RIGHT people for you will love you for doing so, and they will appreciate all the things about you that the WRONG people are intimidated by. Bottom line: Don’t change so people will like you; be patient, keep being your amazing self, and pretty soon the RIGHT people will love the REAL you. Don’t lose yourself in your search for acceptance by others. Walk your path confidently and don’t expect anyone else to understand your journey, especially if they have not been exactly where you are going. You have to take the steps that are right for you; no one else walks in your shoes. Let others take you as you are, or not at all. Speak your truth even if your voice shakes. By being true to yourself, you put something breathtaking into the world that was not there before. You are stunning when your passion and strength shines through as you follow your own path – when you aren’t distracted by the opinions of others. You are powerful when you let your mistakes educate you, and your confidence builds from firsthand experiences – when you know you can fall down, pick yourself up, and move forward without asking for anyone else’s permission. (Read Awaken the Giant Within.) In every situation you have ever been in, positive or negative, the one common thread is you. It is your responsibility, and yours alone, to recognize that regardless of what has happened up to this point in your life, you are capable of making choices to change your situation, or to change the way you think about it. Don’t let the opinions of others interfere with this prevailing reality. What you’re capable of achieving is not a function of what other people think is possible for you. What you’re capable of achieving depends entirely on what you choose to do with your time and energy. So stop worrying about what everyone else thinks. Just keep living your truth. The only people that will fault you for doing so are those who want you to live a lie. When you find yourself trapped between what moves you and what society tells you is right for you, always travel the route that makes you feel alive – unless you want everyone to be happy, except you. No matter where life takes you, big cities or small towns, you will inevitably come across others who think they know what’s best for you – people who think they’re better than you – people who think happiness, success and beauty mean the same things to everyone. They’ll try to measure your worth based on what you have, instead of who you are. But you know better than that – material things don’t matter. Don’t chase the money. Catch up to the ideas and activities that make you come alive. Go for the things of greater value – the things money can’t buy. What matters is having strength of character, an honest heart, and a sense of self-worth. If you’re lucky enough to have any of these things, never sell them. Never sell yourself short. (Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” and “Simplicity” chapters of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Everyone wants to get to the top of the mountain first and shout, “Look at me! Look at me!” But the truth is, all your happiness and growth occurs while you’re climbing, not while you’re sitting at the top. Enjoy the journey by paying attention to each step. Don’t rush through your life and miss it. Forget where everyone else is in relation to you. This isn’t a race. You get there a little at a time, not all at once. Let go of the foolish need to prove yourself to everyone else, and you’ll free yourself to accomplish what matters most to you. Sometimes you have to remind yourself that you don’t have to always be and do what everyone else is being and doing. You are an ever-changing work in progress. You don’t have to always be right, you just have to not be too worried about being wrong. Screwing up is part of the process. Looking like a fool sometimes is the only way forward. If you try too hard to impress everyone else with your “perfection,” you will stunt your growth. You will spend all your time looking a certain way, instead of living a certain way. It’s impossible to live without failing sometimes, unless you live so cautiously that you aren’t really living at all – you’re merely existing. If you’re too afraid of failing in front of others, you can’t possibly do what needs to be done to be successful in your own eyes. You have to remember that it doesn’t matter how many times you fail or how messy your journey is, so long as you do not stop taking small steps forward. In the end, those who don’t care that failure is inevitable are the ones that reach their dreams. YOU can be one of them. (Read The Last Lecture.) Some people will always tell you what you did wrong, and then hesitate to compliment you for what you did right. Don’t be one of them, and don’t put up with them. When you run into someone who discredits you, disrespects you and treats you poorly for no apparent reason at all, don’t consume yourself with trying to change them or win their approval. And be sure not to leave any space in your heart to hate them. Simply walk away and let karma deal with the things they say and do, because any bit of time you spend on these people will be wasted, and any bit of hate and aggravation in your heart will only hurt you in the end. You don’t need a standing ovation or a bestseller or a promotion or a million bucks. You are enough right now. You have nothing to prove. Care less about who you are to others and more about who you are to yourself. You will have less heartaches and disappointments the minute you stop seeking from others the validation only YOU can give yourself.

Photo by: Lali Masriera 40 Quotes that Will Calm Your Mind When You’re at a Crossroads in Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/40-quotes-calm-mind.jpg?resize=500%2C334&ssl=1| It happens to all of us gradually as we live and grow. We discover more about who we are and the way life really is, and then we realize there are some changes we need to make. The lifestyle we’ve been living no longer fits. The environments and relationships we once found comfort in no longer exist, or no longer serve our best interests. So we cherish all the great memories, but find ourselves at a crossroads, choosing to embark on the first stretch of a brand new path. And it’s not easy. It’s painful to give up what’s comfortable and familiar, especially when you have no other choice. Marc and I have struggled through this process many times out of necessity. Over the past decade we’ve had to deal with several significant, unexpected life changes and challenges, including: Those experiences were brutal. Each of them, naturally, knocked us down and off course for a period of time. But once we accepted the truth, by giving up our innocent ideals and letting go of the way things used to be, we pressed forward, stronger, and with a greater understanding and respect for life. Getting to the right state of mind—one that actually allowed us to move forward with our lives—required mindful practice. Because when we were initially faced with each one of those brutal experiences—when we were standing at the forefront of another rocky crossroads in our lives—you better believe our minds were spinning with negative emotions. We had to learn to catch ourselves in that negative state of emotional unrest, and then consciously calm our minds, so we could think straight, and make the best decisions possible with the hand we’d been dealt. The simplest way of doing this? Proactive daily reminders. It’s all about keeping the right thoughts at the top of your mind every day, so they’re readily available on those inevitable days when you need them most. For us, that meant sitting down quietly with ourselves every morning and reflecting on precisely what we needed to remember. We used quotes (many of which are tiny excerpts from our books) like the ones below to do just that. Some people call them affirmations, or mantras, or prayers, or convictions, but in any case these daily reminders kept us on track by keeping calm, peaceful, productive thoughts and perspectives at the top of our minds, even when life got utterly chaotic. We ultimately learned that peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble, or hard realities to deal with—peace means to be in the midst of all those things and still remain calm in your mind. Challenge yourself to choose one of these quotes every morning, and then sit quietly for two minutes while repeating it silently in your mind. See how doing so gradually changes the way you think through life’s twists and turns and crossroads. 1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  8.  9.  10.  11.  12.  13.  14.  15.  16.  17.  18.  19.  20.  21.  22.  23.  24.  25.  26.  27.  28.  29.  30.  31.  32.  33.  34.  35.  36.  37.  38.  39.  40.

This past Saturday, while Angel and I were enjoying a safe and peaceful backyard barbecue at our friend Sara’s house, her 16-year-old foster child, Cody, received an unexpected visit from his biological mother – a woman who has been in and out of prison and rehab her whole life. Although Sara was a bit hesitant about it, she let Cody and his mother talk privately on the front porch. We occasionally eavesdropped from the living room window just to make sure everything was okay. Cody’s mother was extremely rough around the edges and almost immediately started bringing up hurtful memories from the past. About 20 minutes into the conversation, she told him, “I see your anger, and I just wish I could go back in time and raise you again, to change who you are and give you a better upbringing.” Sara was about to walk out onto the porch to interject when Cody calmly replied, “I’m not angry. I’m perfectly fine, thank you. I’m proud of who I am. Maybe you should go even further back in time and change who you are instead.” And then he walked his mother to the front steps of the porch and politely asked her to leave. Cody’s response impressed me on so many levels. It takes a lot of courage, especially at 16 years of age, with a rough upbringing, to tactfully stand up for yourself. And he handled himself with grace. So, whenever you’re dealing with a difficult or hostile person, remember how Cody handled himself. Take a stand! Set some boundaries! This is your life. You may not be able to control all the things people do to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them. You can decide not to let their actions and opinions invade your heart and mind. And above all, you can decide whom to walk beside into tomorrow, and whom to leave behind today. It’s time to… What would you add to the list? What’s one thing you will NOT let others do to you?

When I awake in the morning, my mind gradually gathers, and I begin to move as the early morning light is just starting to seep through the windows.  My family is still sleeping.  It’s a peaceful beginning. I stretch, have a glass of water, start the tea kettle, and practice a gratitude meditation for ten minutes.  Then I enjoy a cup of tea as I read one chapter of a good book.  And finally, I write for an hour before the busyness of the day begins. Once my family awakes, I pause to join them for a short time and we follow some simple morning rituals together too. This is just a rough sketch of my mornings, and they make me happy. It wasn’t always this way though.  I used to awake in a hurry, rushing and cranky before stumbling into work and errands and meetings.  It was awful, but it was my life.  I didn’t know any better, so I didn’t think I could change things.  Thankfully, I was wrong. I’ve changed my mornings, so they work for me and not against me, with just a few simple rituals.  And I’ve shared these morning rituals with thousands of coaching clients/students over the years, and many of them come back to me a month or two later and say, “Thank you!”  Perhaps they will help you as well. If your mornings are chaotic, the simple solution is to get up a little earlier than the chaos.  This, of course, starts the night before by going to bed a bit earlier too. Adjust gradually, wake up just 10 minutes earlier each week for the next 6-9 weeks, and you’ll barely notice the change from day to day.  This extra time will help you avoid stress, speeding tickets, tardiness and other unnecessary headaches. Begin each day with love, grace and gratitude.  When you arise in the morning think of what an incredible privilege it is to be alive – to be, to see, to hear, to think, to love, to have something to look forward to.  Happiness is a big part of these little parts of your life; joy is simply the feeling of appreciating it all. Realize that it’s not happiness that makes us grateful, but gratefulness that makes us happy.  Make a habit of noticing the goodness that’s already yours first thing in the morning, and you will see more goodness everywhere you look throughout the day. Simple, but so often forgotten… stretching your body in the morning has these key benefits: If you’re uncertain about how to stretch properly, you can find hundreds of great tutorials on YouTube.  Choose one that you think will suit you best and practice it for a minute or two every morning.  You will sense a change yourself, guaranteed. Another obvious practice that goes by the wayside… Your body is more than 60% water, and when you’ve been sleeping all night without drinking any water, it gets dehydrated and desperate for hydration.  So quench your thirst with exactly what your body needs.  Avoid drinking coffee, tea or other beverages before you have at least one tall glass of water.  By doing so your body will start to wake up and you’ll naturally feel more energized and alive.  (Read Healthy Habits.) One of my personal mistakes several years ago was trying to fit too much into my mornings.  When I first started waking up early I wanted to workout, meditate, handle household chores, read, write, cook breakfast, reply to work emails, run errands, etc., and it turns out I couldn’t do all those things.  I was waking up early and stressing myself out.  I made my early mornings just as packed as the rest of the day. What has helped me is having a few key things I do early, but not being over-committed to lots of goals and agendas.  I’d rather have space and flexibility, which makes the time much more peaceful and useful.  So the glass of water, stretching, gratitude meditation, tea, reading and writing are the only agendas I have on most mornings, but I’m flexible with those also. Again, DO NOT fill your mornings with things you have to do… but, DO have a few things you can’t wait to get out of bed and get started on.  For me, that goes back to my short list, which includes reading and writing – two of my greatest passions.  For you, perhaps a long meditative walk, yoga, prayer, painting, or simply reading the morning paper. In other words, don’t just have a long list of things you think you should do but don’t really want to do.  Give your early mornings to yourself as a gift. Some of the happiest and most successful people I know read a bit of scripture each morning, some read inspiring books, articles or quotes, while others listen to radio, podcasts or audio programs that move them to get their day started.  The key is having a ritual focused on absorbing small doses of self-improvement content to stretch and nurture your perspective and knowledge base.  It starts the day off on a positive note with positive, productive ideas to guide your day’s journey.  And that’s crucial, because your thoughts guide your reality. So indulge in something positive every morning when you awake, and let it inspire you to do something positive before you go back to sleep at night.  That’s how memorable, manageable days are made.  (Angel and I discuss this in detail in the “Inspiration” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Your early morning moments aren’t just about the things you do; they’re also about the open space between the things.  That means the space itself is something to be appreciated as well. So if you meditate and read, the morning isn’t just valuable because of the meditation and reading… the space around those two activities is also incredible.  The time spent walking over to your meditation mat, or finding your book, or turning the pages, or pouring a cup of tea, or sitting and watching the sunrise… these little open spaces are just as important as anything else. Pace yourself so you’re not hurrying from one thing to the next, but instead noticing and appreciating the spaces in between, too. As human beings we are goal oriented.  We like making progress.  When we accomplish one of our goals, we smile about it.  That’s why the happiest people I know are also some of the most successful people I know. As your early morning winds down, the key is to funnel your attention directly into the right things, not the urgent things.  Because at some point we all wonder, “Why is it so impossible to get everything done?”  And the answer is stunningly simple: We’re doing too many of the wrong things. Several research studies have shown that people never get more done by blindly working more hours on everything that comes up.  Instead, they get more done when they follow careful plans that measure and track key priorities and milestones.  So if you want to be more successful, less stressed, and a lot happier at the end of each day, don’t ask how to make something more efficient until you’ve first asked, “Do I need to do this at all?” Simply being able to do something well does not make it the right thing to do.  I think this is one of the most common problems with a lot of time-management advice; too often productivity gurus focus on how to do things quickly, but the vast majority of things people do quickly should not be done at all. A great morning isn’t something that magically happens – it’s created consciously. You don’t have to implement all these ideas, but I challenge you to try one or two and see how your mornings improve. I bet you’ll begin to enjoy them as much as I do. How do you like to start your mornings?  What helps you start the day off right?  Please let us know by leaving a comment below.

Valente This short article was inspired by an email we received this morning from a new course student: Dear Marc and Angel, I have a big problem.  I’m intelligent, highly educated in my field of study, and have achieved numerous professional accolades while working for large corporations over the years, but now that I’ve branched out on my own as an entrepreneur I’m stuck in a rut.  I have dozens of good ideas that I can easily execute on, but every time I rev up and start taking massive action, I get overwhelmed and scared.  I start second-guessing my choices and myself.  Or I start worrying about and obsessing over all the possibilities for both success and failure, until everything comes to a halt and I’m utterly exhausted.  There’s so much I want to achieve, and I know I’m capable if I could just get beyond this.  What do you recommend? Sincerely, An Overwhelmed Student Dear Overwhelmed Student, It’s time for a quick story about life… Once upon a time there was a woman who had been lost in the desert for three whole days without water.  Just as she was about to collapse, she saw what appeared to be a lake just a few hundred yards in front of her.  “Could it be?  Or is it just a mirage?” she thought to herself. With the last bit of strength she could muster, she staggered toward the lake and quickly learned that her prayers had been answered: it was no mirage – it was indeed a large, spring-fed lake full of fresh water – more fresh water than she could ever drink in her lifetime.  Yet while she was literally dying of thirst, she couldn’t bring herself to drink the water.  She simply stood by the water’s edge and stared down at it. There was a passerby riding on a camel from a nearby desert town who was watching the woman’s bizarre behavior.  He got off his camel, walked up to the thirsty woman and asked, “Why don’t you have a drink, ma’am?” She looked up at the man with an exhausted, distraught expression across her face and tears welling up in her eyes.  “I am dying of thirst,” she said, “But there is way too much water here in this lake to drink.  No matter what I do, I can’t possibly finish it all.” The passerby smiled, bent down, scooped some water up with his hands, lifted it to the woman’s mouth and said, “Ma’am, your opportunity right now, and as you move forward throughout the rest of your life, is to understand that you don’t have to drink the whole lake to quench your thirst.  You can simply take one sip.  Just one small sip… and then another if you choose.  Focus only on the mouthful in front of you, and all your anxiety, fear and overwhelm about the rest will gradually fade.” Sincerely,Marc and Angel Challenge yourself today to focus solely on the sip (task, step, etc.) you’re actually taking. Honestly, that’s all life is – small, positive actions that you take moment by moment, and then one day when you look back it all adds up to something worthwhile – something that’s often far better, and different, than what you had imagined when you started. So please leave a comment below and let us know: What’s the one small, positive action you are going to focus on today?

"30 Regrets You Don’t Want to Have in 30 Years|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/40-regrets-40-years.jpg?resize=500%2C379&ssl=1| “If only…” These two words paired together create one of the saddest phrases in the English language. Today is my late grandfather’s birthday. He was a great man and he would have been 101. So I want to acknowledge him right now by re-sharing a bittersweet story with you — a story that continues to remind me to acknowledge myself, and what matters most in life. In the final decade of his life, my grandfather woke up every single day at 7AM, picked a fresh wild flower on his morning walk, and took it to my grandmother. One morning I decided to go with him to see her. And as he placed the flower on her gravestone, he looked up at me and said, “I just wish I had picked her a fresh flower every morning when she was alive. She really would have loved that.” As you can imagine, my grandfather’s words touched a nerve in me. And over the years I’ve often reflected on what he said that morning, and how his sentiment relates to everyone and everything I care about. God willing, in 30 years when I’m in my mid-70’s, I don’t want to rest with unnecessary regrets. I don’t want to wish I had done things differently, especially something as simple and meaningful as picking wild flowers for the love of my life. Don’t you agree? Regardless of your age or where you are in your life right now, perhaps you will generally resonate with my thoughts here – some little things I don’t want to regret down the road… Angel and I have mentioned this in previous articles, but I figured it was worth reiterating here because regrets sometimes sneak up on us. As alluring as the idea of living a regret-free life sounds, it’s rarely an easy feat. Oftentimes before we even realize it, our minds are dwelling on missed opportunities and mistakes. Yes, even when we know better we regret things. And we do so simply because we worry that we should have made different decisions in the past. We should have done a better job, but didn’t. We should have given a relationship another chance, but didn’t. We should have started that business, but didn’t. We compare the real outcomes of our past decisions to an ideal fantasy of how things “should” be. The problem of course is that we can’t change our past decisions, because we can’t change the past. Yet we resist this truth to no end — we keep over-analyzing and comparing the unchangeable past reality to our ideal fantasy until we’ve wasted days of our lives in utter misery. But why? If we logically know better, why can’t we just let all our ideals and fantasies GO? Because we identify personally with these ideals and fantasies. We all have this vision in our minds of who we are — our great intentions, our intelligence, our social impact, etc. Even if you struggle with certain self-esteem issues, you probably still identify with yourself as being a decent and respectful human being. And so when someone says something about us that contradicts the vision of ourselves that we identify with — when they insult our intentions, our intelligence, our status, etc. — we take offense. We feel personally attacked and we have a hard time letting it go. Something very similar happens when we believe we did something — made a mistake for example — that contradicts that same vision of ourselves that we identify with. We take offense! And in some cases we implode on ourselves — we berate ourselves for making the mistake. “How could I have done this?” we think. “Why couldn’t I have been smarter and made a better decision?” And again, we have a hard time letting it go — we have a hard time coming to grips with the fact that we aren’t always as good as the vision we have of ourselves. So in a nutshell, our ideals and fantasies about ourselves tend to cause us lots of misery. The key is to gradually practice letting go of these ideals and fantasies, and focus instead on making the best of your present reality. The truth must be embraced… Of course, all of this is easier said than done, but whenever you find yourself regretting a past decision, you can 1) acknowledge that you’re falling into this pattern, 2) realize that there’s some ideal or fantasy you’re comparing your decisions or yourself to, and 3) gradually let go of this ideal or fantasy by making peace with what’s behind you, so you can focus more on what’s directly in front of you. I challenge you to put the reminders in this article to good use. And I challenge you to give yourself some credit right now for the fact that you’re already doing a pretty good job with at least some of the 30 points above… Yes, let’s flip the concept of this article around for a second, and instead of sharing something you don’t want to regret down the road, tell me this: What have you done lately that you know you will NOT regret down the road? Please leave a comment below and share your thoughts and insights. Photo by: Hartwig HKD 7 Simple Yet Powerful Metaphors that Will Change the Way You Think|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-simple-metaphors.jpg?resize=500%2C332&ssl=1| 7 Calming Quotes that Will Stop You from Taking Things Personally|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-mantras-personally.jpg?resize=500%2C334&ssl=1| In most cases you can’t calm the storm. What you can do is calm yourself, and the storm will gradually pass. So breathe when stress or negativity surrounds you today. Let calmness be your superpower. The ability to not overreact or take things personally always gives you the upper hand. Remind yourself that people are hard to be around when they believe everything happening around them is a direct assault on them, or is in some way all about them. Don’t fall into this trap. What people say and do to you is much more about them, than you. People’s reactions to you are about their perspectives, wounds, and experiences. Whether people think you’re amazing or believe you’re the worst, again, is more about the storms they are going through and how they view the world. Now, I’m not suggesting we should be self-indulged narcissists and ignore all the opinions and commentary we receive from others. I’m simply saying that incredible amounts of hurt, disappointment, and sadness in our lives come directly from our tendency to take things too personally. In most cases it’s far more productive and healthy to let go of other people’s good or bad opinions of you, and to operate with your own intuition and wisdom as your guide. The underlying key is to… When something stressful happens in a social situation, what’s your response? Some people jump right into action, but oftentimes this immediate action can be harmful. Others get angry or sad. Still others start to feel sorry for themselves — perhaps victimized — and left thinking: “Why can’t people behave better?” Although enforcing your boundaries is important, again, on an average day rash responses like these are rarely healthy or helpful. The bottom line is you’re not alone if you struggle with taking things too personally. We all make this mistake sometimes. If someone does something we disagree with, we tend to interpret it as a personal attack… Some people even think life itself is personally against them. But the truth is, almost nothing in life is personal — things happen, or they don’t, and it’s rarely all about anyone specifically. People have emotional issues they’re dealing with, and it makes them defiant, rude, and thoughtless sometimes. They are doing the best they can, or they’re not even aware of their issues. In any case, you can learn not to interpret their behaviors as personal attacks, and instead see them as non-personal encounters (like a dog barking in the distance, or a bumblebee buzzing by) that you can either respond to with a calm mindset, or not respond to at all. Here’s what you need to remember… Like you, I’m only human, and I sometimes still take things personally when I’m in the heat of the moment. So I’ve implemented a simple strategy to support the practice of watching my response. In a nutshell, I proactively remind myself NOT to take things personally. Anytime I catch myself doing so, I pause and read a few of the following quotes — my little notes to self — to myself. Then I take some fresh deep breaths… Some of the quotes above potentially require a willingness to cordially deal with people who yell at us, interrupt us, cut us off in traffic, talk about terribly distasteful things, etc. These people violate the way we think people should behave. And sometimes their behavior deeply offends us. But if we let these people get to us, again and again, we will be upset and offended far too often. So what else can we do beyond reading calming quotes and reminders to ourselves? There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution, but here are three general strategies Marc and I often recommend to our coaching clients and course students: Try one of these strategies next time you begin to notice that someone is getting under your skin. And re-read a few of the quotes above too. Then smile in serenity, armed with the comforting knowledge that there’s no reason to let someone else’s behavior turn you into someone you aren’t. How has “taking things personally” affected your life and relationships? Do you have any additional thoughts or insights to share? Marc and I would love to hear from YOU. Please leave a reply below.

Photo by: Bless Her Heart 5 Things You Forget About the Precious Little Time You Have Left|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/5-little-time-we-have-left.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| May you truly live every day of your life. Alyssa was my best friend. She was a talented musician, a graceful gymnast, a brilliant writer, and a deeply passionate human being. She cared about people. Love bled from every facet of her being. When she spoke, her eyes were as sincere as her words. And she always wanted to understand what was wrong so she could strive to make it better. But Alyssa woke up one day during her senior year in college with a strange pain in her chest. The on-campus doctors didn’t understand why, so they referred her to a specialist. After several MRIs and blood tests, they determined that she had a rare escalated case of Hodgkin’s lymphoma — a form of cancer. She spent the next three years suffering through varying degrees of pain and sickness as multiple doctors treated her with radiation and chemotherapy. And although these doctors were initially hopeful, Alyssa’s condition worsened, and she eventually succumbed to her cancer, dying on her 25th birthday. Ethan was also my friend. Although not as multi-talented as Alyssa, he was incredibly smart, particularly when it came to money and business tactics. But sadly, he didn’t care about people one bit. I eventually learned, just before ending our 10-year friendship, that he ripped people off for a living. He primarily targeted elderly folks who had a relatively small life savings. “They’re all suckers,” he told me. And he felt no remorse because, he continued, “they’ll all be dead soon anyway.” Today, at the age of 40, Ethan is a multi-millionaire. And although we haven’t spoken in years, I’ve heard from others that he still hasn’t gotten into any legal trouble — largely, I think, because of the calculated legal threats I’ve heard he makes to anyone he suspects might have a good conscience. I hear, also, that he doesn’t suffer from any major health problems, and that he, his complicit wife, and his two healthy sons live in a mansion somewhere in Los Angeles. These are real stories, and yet they’re old stories — familiar stories. The people and circumstances differ slightly for everyone who tells them, but the core lessons remain the same: Life is short and it isn’t fair. Bad things do happen to good people. And good things do happen to bad people. Tragically, these stories and lessons often fuel the excuses many of us use when we choose not to follow our hearts. And they fuel the excuses many of us use when we choose to treat ourselves and each other without dignity and respect. “Why care?” we argue, “when the Alyssa’s of the world suffer and die young while the Ethan’s of the world sip wine at five-star resorts well into their eighties.” But for some of us, Alyssa and Ethan are the reason we do follow our hearts. His story is the reason we live to make the world a little brighter, and to make people a little happier. And her story is the reason we use all of the strength we have right now. Because we know we may not have the same strength tomorrow… Because a world with no guarantees requires us to make the best of the precious little time we have left. You have to admit, you know deep down that life is short and precious, and yet you often forget to act accordingly. You act like a healthy 85 years is guaranteed even though you know better. And you aren’t alone either. The truth is, we all forget, again and again… So what’s the secret to staying on track? The secret is no secret. When you forget, remind yourself, forgive yourself, and begin again… The biggest key, Angel and I have discovered, is consistently keeping the right thoughts and intentions at the top of our minds. Over the past 15 years we’ve written various reminders like the ones I’ve listed below, and then we’ve placed them where we can easily see and reference them (for example, a couple of these reminders are printed out and taped up on the wall in our home office right now). These “notes to self” help us stay on track, by empowering us to make the best and most effective use of our time. We’ve passed these same reminders on to our course students, coaching clients, and live seminar attendees in the past too, and many of them have taken the time to personally thank us for doing so. I hope YOU find value in them today, too: Some people wait all day for 5pm, all week for Friday, all year for the holidays, all their lives for happiness. Don’t be one of them. Life is just too short. Time is flying. Don’t wait until your life is almost over to realize how good it has been, or how much potential you have. Truly, the secret to more happiness and progress is letting today be what it is, instead of what you think it should be, and then making the very best of it. Because if you don’t allow yourself to gradually move through life’s challenges — what happened, what was said, what was felt — you will look at your present and future with the same dirty lens. So keep reminding yourself: What you do today always matters a little bit more than what happened yesterday. Focus your energy not on fixing and fighting yesterday, but on building and growing something new right now. There are hundreds of people in every town on Earth who live their entire lives on the default settings, never realizing they can customize everything. Don’t be one of them. Don’t settle for the default settings in life. Find your loves, your talents, your passions, and embrace them. Don’t hide behind other people’s decisions. Don’t let others tell you what you want, or what you are capable of. Explore the unknowns! Test the limits! Design YOUR journey every step of the way. In other words, forget popularity. Just do your thing with passion, humility, and honesty. Do what you do, not for an applause, but because it’s what’s right. Pursue it a little bit each day, no matter what anyone else thinks. That’s how dreams are achieved. If you want a job, be ready to work. If you want a relationship, be ready to work. If you want a family, be ready to work. If you want happiness, be ready… to learn and earn and give and grow, NOT just want and have and take and show. Truth be told, one of the most important abilities you can develop in life is the willingness to accept and grow through life’s challenges and discomforts. Because the best things are often hard to come by, at least initially. And if you shy away from hard work and discomfort, you’ll miss out on them entirely. Mastering a new skill is hard. Building a business is hard. Writing a book is hard. A marriage is hard. Friendship is hard. Parenting is hard. Staying healthy is hard. But all are amazing and worth every bit of effort you can muster. (NOTE: Angel and I discuss this further in the “Success” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Some people will be kind to you. Some won’t. Be kind either way. Through kindness you have the ability to make a profound difference in every life you touch, including your own. When you guide somebody who is lost and confused, when you hold somebody who is sad and grieving, when you hug somebody who has lost all their hope, you too will feel yourself healing and growing stronger. I know it’s not always easy, but just keep reminding yourself that you will end up disappointed if you expect people will always do for you as you do for them. Not everyone has the same to give, or the same inner strength and resolve as you. So no matter what has happened, or what happens today, be kind to people. Smile. Compliment them. Magnify their strengths, not their weaknesses. It’s truly a more peaceful way to live day by day, and a beautiful legacy to leave behind in the long run. Nothing lasts. Everything changes. Day to day is a winding road. As human beings we are constantly outgrowing what we once thought we couldn’t live without, and falling in love with what we didn’t even know we wanted. Life literally keeps leading us on journeys we would never go on if it were up to us. Don’t be afraid. Have faith. Find the lessons. Trust the journey. You will gradually learn that nobody gets too far without losing somebody they love, something they need, or something they thought was meant to be. But it is these very losses that make us stronger and eventually move us toward future opportunities. Embrace these opportunities. Enter new relationships and new situations, knowing that you are venturing into unfamiliar territory. Be ready to learn, be ready for a challenge, and be ready to experience something or meet somebody that just might change your life forever. Although it still hurts sometimes, it’s also inspiring to think that, nearly two decades after her passing, fond memories of my friend Alyssa continue to guide many of the decisions Angel and I make on a daily basis. And Alyssa is not our only source of inspiration. Over the years Angel and I have lost several key figures in our lives too soon to death, including Angel’s brother Todd and our mutual best friend Josh. Every single word we write on this blog and in our books, every single live event we host, and every coaching session we hold with a client or student, is done with these people, and the timeless reminders they’ve inspired, in mind. And I’m sure you can relate in some way… Again, to a greater or lesser extent, we all know deep down that life is fleeting, and that our mortality — our inevitable demise — will catch up to each and every one of us eventually. And yet we are infinitely surprised when it catches up to somebody we know. It’s like walking up a long flight of stairs with a distracted mind and miscalculating the final step. You expected there to be one more stair than there is, but there isn’t, and so you find yourself off balance, tripping over yourself for a while, until your mind shifts back to the present moment and the reality of how life truly is. Let’s take a deep breath right now and take this to heart. Let’s make the best of the precious little time we have left, together. . . . And if you’re feeling up to it, I’d love to know what you think of this post. Which point resonated the most? What’s on your mind right now? Please leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

Think about that question for a moment. Let it sink in. You ultimately become what you repeatedly do. The acquisition of knowledge doesn’t mean you’re growing — growing happens only when what you know changes how you live on a daily basis (most people miss the second part). And isn’t it funny how day by day nothing changes, but when you look back everything is different? That’s the power of daily rituals. Now it’s time think about your rituals — the little things you do every day. Because these little things define you. All the results in your life come from these little things. Regardless of your unique life circumstances, or how you define success, you don’t suddenly become successful. You become successful over time based on your rituals. Failure occurs in the same way. All your little daily failures (that you don’t learn and grow from) come together and cause you to fail… Then one day you wake up and your business has failed. It was all the little things you did or didn’t do on a daily basis — your rituals — not just one inexplicable, catastrophic event. Think about how this relates to your life. Your life is your “business!” And your rituals make or break you, one day at a time. Even the seemingly insignificant rituals you engage in can produce ripples of consequence, for better or worse. So how have you been managing your rituals, and thus your life? Are the little things you’re doing every day working for you or against you? If you think the answer might be the latter, you will find value in the tiny daily rituals listed below. Each of them gradually strengthens common weak points we’ve seen plaguing hundreds of our course students, coaching clients, and live event attendees over the past 15 years (these weak points are little negative patterns of behavior that almost all of us struggle with at some point). And remember, this article is about making tiny, sustainable changes in your routine behavior. That means practicing each one of these rituals gradually — one at a time, one day at a time, and then letting them build on one another. Go from zero to six over the course of six months, or maybe less, but certainly not all at once. Yes, I literally mean washing your dishes. It’s just one small step forward: When you eat your oatmeal, wash your bowl and spoon. When you finish drinking your morning coffee, rinse the coffee pot and your mug. Don’t leave any dirty dishes in the sink or on the counter for later. Wash them immediately. Form this small ritual one dish at a time, one day at a time. Once you do this consistently for a couple weeks, you can start making sure the sink has been wiped clean too. Then the counter. Then put your clothes where they belong when you take them off. Then start doing a few sit-ups every morning. Eat a few vegetables for dinner. And so forth. Do one of these at a time, and you’ll start to build a healthy ritual of practicing self-discipline, and finally know yourself to be capable of doing the little things that must be done, and finishing what you start. But again, to start, just wash your dishes. Mindfully, with a smile. Oprah keeps a journal. Taylor Swift keeps a journal. Eminem keeps a journal. Successful people all over the world — those who consistently make positive changes in their lives — reflect daily and learn from their life experiences. And they often use some kind of journal to accomplish this. If you want to get somewhere in life, you need a map, and your journal is that map. You can write down what you did today, what you tried to accomplish, where you made mistakes, and so much more. It’s a place to reflect. It’s a place to capture important thoughts. It’s a place to sort out where you’ve been and where you intend to go. And it’s one of the most underused, yet incredibly effective tools available to the masses. Just this morning, I spent fifteen minutes journaling about some recent events in my life that I’m grateful for, and some that are still troubling me. As I was wrapping up, the idea for the blog post you’re reading now came to me, which was a pleasant surprise since I hadn’t yet decided what I was going to share with you today. I also unearthed some incredibly healthy insights regarding an important relationship that I had been neglecting, which motivated me to immediately send out a text message to someone I care about who I’ve been meaning to reconnect with. We now have a brunch date scheduled for next Sunday. So as you can infer, your time spent focusing inward and journaling doesn’t just help you — your mind is powerful and your thoughts create ripples in the world around you. When you bring clarity into your life, you bring the best of yourself into everything you do — you tend to treat yourself and others better, communicate more constructively, do things for the right reasons, and ultimately improve the world you’re living in. This is why journaling for a short time every day can actually make a significant real-world difference in your life. (Note: If you’re interested in starting a journaling practice sometime soon, check out our upcoming guided journal, “The Good Morning Journal”, which is being published by Penguin Random House.) Be honest… The biggest cost of doing multiple things at once like this (assuming you don’t crash from the occasional texting and driving) is a gradual decline in your productivity and happiness over the long-term. When you get in the habit of persistently dividing your attention, you’re partially engaged in every activity, but rarely focused on any one. And this dizzying lack of focus eventually trips you up and brings you down. Let’s use a quick metaphor to bring this point home: If you hold a magnifying glass over a small pile of dry leaves as the sun shines bright on the hottest afternoon of the whole year, NOTHING will happen… …so long as you keep moving the magnifying glass quickly from one leaf to the next. But as soon as you hold the magnifying glass still and FOCUS the sun’s magnified rays on one single area of one single leaf, the whole pile of leaves will ignite into flames.  That’s the power of focusing on one thing at a time. Your opportunity on a daily basis is to realize that you are the magnifying glass in your own life, and that you can intentionally focus the energy you get from the world on one single leaf at a time. When you do so, you will ignite incredible “flames” that move your projects, your dreams, your relationships, and even the world around you, forward. Most of the things we desperately try to hold on to, as if they’re real, solid, everlasting fixtures in our lives, aren’t really there. Or if they are there in some form, they’re changing, fluid, impermanent, or simply imagined in our minds. Life gets a lot easier to deal with when we understand this. Imagine you’re blindfolded and treading water in the center of a large swimming pool, and you’re struggling desperately to grab the edge of the pool that you think is nearby, but in reality it’s not — it’s far away. Trying to grab that imaginary edge is stressing you out, and tiring you out, as you splash around aimlessly trying to holding on to something that isn’t there. Now imagine you pause, take a deep breath, and realize that there’s nothing nearby to hold on to. Just water around you. You can continue to struggle with grabbing at something that doesn’t exist, or you can accept that there’s only water around you, and relax, and float. On a daily basis, I challenge you to consciously ask yourself: Then imagine the thing you’re trying to hold on to doesn’t really exist. Envision yourself letting go… and floating. (Note: Marc and I guide readers through this process in the “Letting Go” chapter of our daily reminders book, “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.) Some things in life are worth changing. Most things are not. Let that sink in for a moment. Then consider this: “If you want to control the animals, give them a larger pasture.” That’s a quote Marc and I heard at a meditation retreat several years ago in a group discussion focused on the power of changing your attitude about things you can’t change or don’t need to change. I see “the animals” and their “larger pasture” as a form of letting go and allowing things to be the way they are. Instead of trying to tightly control something, you’re loosening up, giving it more space — a larger pasture. The animals will be happier; they will roam around and do what they naturally do. And your needs will be met too; you will have more space to be at peace with the way the animals are. This same philosophy holds true for many aspects of life — stepping back and allowing certain things to happen means these things will take care of themselves, and your needs will also be met. You will have less stress (and less to do), and more time and energy to work on the things that truly matter, and the things you actually can control — like your attitude about everything. This form of letting go is not giving up. It’s about surrendering any obsessive attachment to particular people, outcomes and situations. It means showing up every day in your life with the intention to be your best self, and to do the best you know how, without expecting life to go a certain way. The energy of someone aspiring to create something wonderful, teamed with this kind of surrender, is far more powerful and rewarding than someone determined to create outcomes with a desperate “must-have” mentality. Surrender brings inner peace and calmness, and lest we forget that our outer lives are a reflection of our inner state of being. Overlooking everything that’s wonderful is a tragedy, and a very debilitating one. When you get lost in worried thoughts about a life situation you think you “should” have, you end up missing the beauty of everything you do have. And you will never be happy if you aren’t consciously thankful for the good things in your life. Here’s a super simple, five-minute daily gratitude exercise that has worked wonders for hundreds of our students and coaching clients over the past 15 years: Every evening before you go to bed, write down three things that went well during the day and their causes. Simply provide a short, causal explanation for each good thing. That’s it. We spend tens of thousands of dollars on expensive electronics, big homes, fancy cars, and lavish vacations hoping for a boost of happiness. This is a free alternative, and it works. In a study of this gratitude exercise’s effectiveness by the famed psychologist Martin Seligman, participants were asked to follow those exact instructions for just one week. After one week the participants were measurably 2% happier than before, but in follow-up tests their happiness kept on increasing, from 5% at one month, to 9% at six months. Even more interestingly, the participants were only required to keep this gratitude journal for one week, but the majority of them continued journaling on their own because they enjoyed it. I tried it for myself nearly two decades ago — I set a goal of doing it for just one week, and I’m still doing it today. So I can assure you it’s effective. Renewing your trust in yourself is one of the most significant hidden benefits of practicing the aforementioned daily rituals. In fact, what Marc and I lacked before we learned to implement these kinds of daily rituals was the trust that we were actually capable of achieving positive results in our lives. We went through a very difficult time together when we were in our twenties — both of us were grieving significant losses in our lives, and we repeatedly failed to get back on our feet. As the weeks rolled into months, we had grown so discouraged in ourselves that we started subconsciously choosing procrastination over future attempts to make progress on the promises we made to ourselves, to heal and move forward. In essence, we lost trust in both our abilities and ourselves. It’s kind of like another person constantly lying to you — eventually you stop trusting them. The same holds true with the promises you make to yourself that always end in disappointment. Eventually you stop trusting yourself. And the solution in most cases is the same too: you have to renew your trust gradually, with tiny promises, tiny steps (your daily rituals), and tiny victories. Of course, this process takes time, but it happens relatively fast if you stick to it. And it’s arguably one of the most important, life-changing things you can do for yourself. (Note: Marc and I build and customize tiny, life-changing daily rituals with our students in the “Goals & Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy course.) If you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU. Which ritual discussed above resonates with you the most today? Anything else to share? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

"18 Things I Wish Someone Told Me When I Was 18-Years-Old|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/18-things-at-18.jpg?resize=500%2C331&ssl=1| This morning I was reading a book outside my favorite beachside coffee shop when an 18-year-old kid sat down next to me and said, “That’s a great read, ain’t it?” So we started chatting. He told me he was getting ready to graduate from high school next week and then immediately starting his college career in the fall. “But I have no clue what I want to do with my life,” he said. “Right now I’m just going with the flow.” And then, with eager eyes, he began asking me one question after the next: I answered his questions as best as I could, and tried to give decent advice with the time I had. And after a half-hour conversation, he thanked me and we parted ways. But on the walk home I realized the conversation I had with that 18-year-old was actually quite nostalgic. He reminded me of me when I was his age, more than twenty years ago. I had so many questions back then. So, I started thinking about his questions again, and I began imagining all of the little things I wish someone had told me when I was 18. Then I took it a step further and thought about all the things I would love to tell myself if I could travel back in time to give my 18-year-old self some quick advice about life… After a few more cups of coffee, a couple hours of deliberation, and some quick back-and-forth text discussions with people I respect, here are 18 things I wish someone told me when I was 18: Mistakes teach you important lessons. The biggest mistake you can make is doing absolutely nothing because you’re too scared to make a mistake. So don’t hesitate for too long — don’t doubt yourself. Remember, if you never act you will never know for sure, and you will be left standing in the same spot forever. In life, it’s rarely about getting a chance; it’s about taking a chance. You’ll never be 100% sure it will work, but you can always be 100% sure doing nothing won’t work. Most of the time you just have to go for it! And no matter how it turns out, it almost always ends up just the way it needs to be. Either you succeed or you learn something. Win-Win. For the most part, what other people think and say about you doesn’t matter that much. When I was 18, I let the opinions of my high school and early college peers influence my decisions. And at times they steered me away from ideas and goals I strongly believed in. I realize now, over twenty years later, that this was a foolish way to live, especially when I consider that nearly all of these people whose opinions I cared so much about are no longer a part of my life. Unless you’re trying to make a great first impression (job interview, first date, etc.), don’t let the opinions of others stand in your way. What they think and say about you isn’t that important. What is important is how you feel about yourself. If I could offer my 18-year-old self some real career advice, I’d tell myself not to base my career choice solely on other people’s ideas, goals, and recommendations. I’d tell myself not to pick a major because it’s popular, or statistically creates graduates who make the most money. I’d tell myself that the right career choice is based on one core point: Finding work you appreciate doing. As long as you remain true to yourself, and follow your own interests and values, you can find success in your own way. Perhaps more importantly, you won’t wake up several years later working in a career field you despise, wondering “How the heck am I going to do this for the next 40 years?” So if you catch yourself working long hours and appreciating every minute of it (or at least seeing the value in your efforts), don’t stop. You’re on to something! Bosses. Colleagues. Professors. Classmates. Social club members. Other students outside of your major or social circle. Teaching assistants. Career advisors. College deans. Friends of friends. Everyone! Why? Professional networking. I have worked for three employers since I graduated from college (I eventually left all three employers by choice on good terms, and started my own business), but I only interviewed with the very first employer. The other two employers offered me a job before I even had a formal interview, based strictly on the recommendation of a hiring manager (someone I had networked with over the years). When employers look to fill a position, the first thing they do is ask the people they know and trust if they know someone who would do well in the position. If you start building your professional network early, you’ll be set. Over time, you’ll continue talking to new people you meet through your current network and your network’s reach and the associated opportunities will continue to snowball. When you invest in yourself, you can never lose, and over time you will change the trajectory of your life. You are simply the product of what you know. The more time, energy and money you spend acquiring pertinent knowledge and experience, the more control you have over your life. Your natural human fears of failure and embarrassment will sometimes stop you from trying new things. But you must rise above these fears, for your life’s story is simply the culmination of many small, unique, and sometimes confusing experiences. The more experiences you have, the more new chapters get written, and the more interesting your story gets. So seek as many new life experiences as possible when you’re young, and be sure to share them with the people you care about. Not doing so is missing out. Think in terms of Karate: A black belt seems far more impressive than a brown belt. But does a brown belt really seem any more impressive than a red belt? Probably not to most people. Remember that society elevates experts high onto a pedestal. Hard work matters, but not if it’s scattered in a hundred difference directions. So narrow your focus on learning the intricacies of a specific career/business niche, and then truly master it. People will never know how you feel unless you tell them. Your boss? Yeah, she doesn’t know you’re hoping for a promotion because you haven’t told her yet. That cute guy (or girl) you haven’t talked to yet because you’re too shy? Yeah, you guessed it — he hasn’t given you the time of day simply because you haven’t given him the time of day either. In real life you have to communicate with others. And oftentimes you have to open your vocal cords and speak the first words. You have to tell people what you’re thinking if you’re looking for a response. When we’re young we tend to waste our time waiting for the ideal path to appear. But it never does of course, because paths are made by walking, not waiting. Now is always the time! And no, you shouldn’t feel more confident before you take the next step. Taking the next step is what builds your confidence. Remember that you can’t change anything or make any sort of progress in life by sitting back and thinking about it. There’s a huge difference between knowing how to do something and actually doing it. Knowledge is basically useless without daily action. However good or bad a situation is now, it will change. That’s the one thing you can count on. So embrace change, and realize that change happens for a reason. It won’t always be easy or obvious at first, but in the end it will likely be worth it in some way. And realize too that the most powerful and practical changes happen when you decide to take control of what you do have power over, instead of constantly craving control over what you don’t. How do you build credibility at a young age? It’s not rocket science. Be honest. Follow through. Honor your word. Say sorry. Listen. Be kind and present. Living a daily life of sincerity creates long-term peace of mind, and peace of mind is priceless later in life. Period. Use this time to think, plan, reflect, and dream. Creative and productive thinking flourish in solitude and silence. With quiet space, you can hear your thoughts, you can reach deep within yourself, and you can focus on mapping out what’s worth your time and energy, and what isn’t. Truth be told, most of your stress on an average day comes from the way you rush to respond, not the way life actually is. Adjust your inner response and all that extra stress is gone. Inner calmness among chaos is a superpower that frees you to focus more effectively on the few things that actually matter. But this takes practice to get there. So create some quiet space for yourself every day, and practice. The greatest ‘adventure’ is the ability to inquire, to ask questions, and to navigate the data that surfaces. And oftentimes in the process of inquiry, the search is more significant than the answers themselves. Because many of life’s answers change and evolve in time. Answers come from other people, from the universe of knowledge and history, and from the intuition and wisdom inside yourself. These answers — and perhaps more importantly, the data you gather alongside them — will never surface if you never ask the right questions. Thus, the simple act of asking the right questions on a daily basis is the answer. The average person is usually astonished when they see a person with a significant physical handicap show intense signs of emotional happiness. How could someone in such a limited physical state be so happy? The answer rests in how they use the resources they do have. Stevie Wonder, for example, couldn’t see, so he exploited his sense of hearing into a passion for music, and he now has 25 Grammy Awards to prove it. Think about how this relates to your life and limitations, and how you can exploit the resources you DO have access to, so you can overcome your limitations. Live a comfortable life, not a wasteful one. Do not spend to impress others. Do not live life trying to fool yourself into thinking wealth is measured in material objects. Manage your money wisely so your money does not manage you. Always live well below your means. In life and business, it’s not so much what you say that counts, it’ how you make people feel. So respect your elders, minors, and everyone in between. There are no boundaries or classes that define a group of people that deserve to be respected. Treat everyone with the same level of respect you would give to your grandmother and the same level of patience you would have with your baby brother. Supporting, guiding, and making contributions to other people is one of life’s greatest rewards. In order to get, you have to give. It’s always easier said than done. Yet, you need to do the hard things to be happy. The things others can’t do for you. The things that frighten you. The things that make the difference between a life filled with empty promises and one filled with gratitude for how far you have come. So remind yourself that there’s no point in doing something if you aren’t going to work hard on doing it right. Excel at your work and excel at your hobbies. Develop a reputation for yourself, a reputation for consistent excellence. Follow your intuition on the road of life… and gradually become who you were born to be. Some of us were born to be musicians — to communicate intricate thoughts and rousing feelings with the strings of a guitar. Some of us were born to be poets — to touch people’s hearts with exquisite prose. Some of us were born to be entrepreneurs — to create growth and opportunity where others saw a void. Still, some of us were born to be or do whatever it is, specifically, that moves you. Regardless of what you decide to do in your lifetime, you better feel like you were born to do it on some level — you better be able to identify with it and grow to love it. And whatever you do, don’t waste your whole life fulfilling someone else’s dreams or needs at the expense of your own. Regardless of your age, I hope you found some value in the reminders above. If you are 18 right now, just do your best with each point, one at a time — not all at once. And above all, laugh when you can, apologize when you should, and let go of what you can’t change as everything evolves. Life is short, yet amazing. Enjoy the ride!

Photo by: Taylor McBride 27 Simple Things to Start Doing for Your Happiness this Summer|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/happiness-this-summer.jpg?resize=500%2C424&ssl=1| It only takes one person to make you happy and change your life this summer: YOU. I am endlessly fascinated by the link between the way we choose to live our lives and the happiness we enjoy on a daily basis. There are choices you make every day, some of which seem completely unrelated to your happiness, that dramatically impact the way you feel both mentally and physically. Over the years, through our coaching practice, live events, and coursework, Marc and I have literally spoken with hundreds of people who are struggling to find happiness in their lives. And what we’ve found is that it usually isn’t what you have, where you are, or what you’ve been through that makes you happy or unhappy on the average day, it’s how you think about it all and what you do with it. In our daily lives it’s easy to miss the forest for the trees and completely overlook some of the simple things that can disproportionally affect our levels of happiness and general fulfillment. Luckily, you don’t have to figure it out all by yourself. Marc and I have spent the better part of fifteen years working one-on-one with our clients and finding the right habits and behaviors that support sustained happiness. Below we’ll take a quick look at some of the more actionable tips that can be easily worked into your daily routine this summer (and be sure to start with just one or two that resonate with you — not all 27 at once). When life feels like an emotional roller coaster, steady yourself with simple rituals. Make the bed. Water the plants. Rinse off your own bowl and spoon. Simplicity attracts calmness and wisdom. Be careful about who you give the microphone and stage to in your life. Don’t just listen to the loudest voice every day. Listen to the truest one. A big part of your life is a result of the little choices you make every day. If you don’t like some part of your life, it’s time to start tweaking things and making better choices this summer. There’s a big difference between being busy and being productive. If you’re going to put in the work this summer, don’t confuse motion and progress. A rocking horse keeps moving but never makes any forward progress. In other words… If you only have fifteen minutes today spare, no problem — make those fifteen minutes meaningful. Focus on small daily steps this summer. And even when the struggle is real, remind yourself that it always feels better to be exhausted from taking a small step forward, than it does to be tired of doing absolutely nothing. Do your best to let go. Remind yourself… You are not your bad days. You are not your mistakes. You are not your scars. You are not your past. Be here now and breathe. And also be careful not to dwell so much on creating your perfect future life that you forget to live today. (Read The Untethered Soul.) Most of the things I’ve worried about didn’t happen. Most of the things I’ve hoped for and worked hard for did. The same is true for the happiest and most successful people I’ve talked to and worked with over the years. So keep dreaming and keep DOING. The best way to move away from something negative is to move toward something positive. There are two energies at the core of the human experience on the average day: Love and Fear. Fear pushes what you want away from you. Love draws it in. Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should. Just because it’s easy, doesn’t mean it’s worth your while. Do what’s right, not what’s easiest right now. It’s a less stressful way to live in the long run. Forget what others have and where they are. You’re not walking in their shoes, and you’ll never comfortably walk in your own if you keep comparing yourself to them. So focus on what’s best for YOU and your unique circumstances. What do you need to do next for your own priorities and objectives? Do it! You won’t be distracted by comparison if you’re captivated with purpose. The more beauty you sincerely find in someone else’s journey, the less you’ll want to compare it directly to your own. Remember, love and kindness begets love and kindness in the long run. The way we treat people we disagree with is the best evidence of what we really believe, and what we have truly learned, about love and kindness. We only really lose the arguments our pride insists on winning. When it’s more important to win arguments than love people, we need to start all over again with our faith, grace, and priorities. (Note: Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the Relationships chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) You will end up very disappointed if you expect people will always do for you as you do for them. Not everyone has the same heart, values, or priorities as you. Keep yourself centered. The fact that you can plant a seed and it becomes a flower, share a bit of knowledge and it becomes another’s, smile at someone and give them hope, is proof that generosity works wonders behind the scenes. So… Be kind. Be present. Be the change you want to see. What you give to another person is really what you give to yourself. When you treat others with love, you learn that you are lovable too. So keep doing your thing today with as much kindness, humility, and honesty as possible. Do what you do, not for repayment or an applause, but because it’s what’s right. Forget about popularity, and just focus on goodness and sincerity today. Gadgets are great, but they can get in the way if you aren’t careful. Control them so they don’t control you. In other words, put down the phone. Don’t avoid eye contact. Don’t hide behind a screen 24/7. Ask about people’s stories. Listen. Engage. And smile together sometimes. People who spend all their time trying to make money, oftentimes spend all their money trying to make time. Don’t do this to yourself. Don’t get stuck in an endless cycle. Put first things first this summer. Our closest relationships are vital to our overall wealth and happiness. As we tell those we love that we love them, we must never forget that the highest compliment is not to utter words, but to live by them. Gratitude is simply the awareness of what’s good. Count your blessings, no matter how small, and start with the breath you’re taking now. And remember, the secret to being grateful is no secret. You choose to be grateful. Then you do it again. When you forget, begin again. (Note: Our newest publication via Penguin Random House, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts & Reflections to Start Every Day”, is a great tool for this kind of perspective shift and gratitude practice.) Practice replacing the phrase “I have to” with “I get to” whenever you catch yourself starting to complain. So many activities we complain about are things others wish they had the chance to do. In almost every situation, a little more willingness to acknowledge that there may be something you do not know could change everything. Go somewhere new, and countless opportunities suddenly appear. Do something differently, and all sorts of great new possibilities spring up. Keep an open mind and have fun with life this summer. You can’t let one bad moment spoil a bunch of good ones. Don’t let the silly little dramas of each day get you down. Joy starts on the inside. Practice focusing on what truly matters, and letting go of what does not. Use your frustrations to motivate you rather than annoy you. You are in control of your focus and how you choose to allocate your energy. Don’t force things this summer. Give it your best shot and then let it be. If it’s meant to be, it will be. Don’t hold yourself down with things you can’t control. No book is just one chapter. No chapter tells the whole story. No mistake defines who we are. Keep turning the pages that need to be turned. Everything that happens helps you grow. Oftentimes difficult experiences teach us priceless life lessons we didn’t think we needed to know. If you’re having some problems, that’s not a bad thing. It means you’re attempting things, taking steps, and making progress. The only people with no problems are the ones doing absolutely nothing. You are a work in progress; which means you get there a little at a time, not all at once. You may not be where you want to be yet, but look how far you’ve come — actually track your progress and reflect on it daily — and be grateful that you’re not stuck where you once were. Don’t let not knowing how it’ll end keep you from beginning this summer. If we allow it to, uncertainty chases us out into the open where life’s true magic is waiting… Yes, it’s your turn starting today! I hope you will have a delightful day, that you will dream boldly and dangerously, that you will start making something that didn’t exist before you took action, that you will love and be loved in return, and that you will find the strength to accept and grow from the troubles you can’t change. And, most importantly (because I think there should be more kindness and wisdom in this crazy world), that you will, when you must, be wise with your decisions, and that you will always be extra kind to yourself and others. And before you go, please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay. Your feedback is important to us. 🙂 Which one of the points above resonated the most today?

Don’t be one of them. Don’t wait until your life is almost over to realize how good it has been. The secret to happiness and peace on the average day is letting this moment be what it is, instead of what you think it should be, and then making the very best of it. Go ahead and sing out loud in the car with the windows down, and dance in your living room, and stay up late laughing, and paint your walls any color you want, and enjoy some sweet wine and chocolate cake. Yes, and go ahead and sleep in on clean white sheets, and throw parties, and paint, and write poetry, and read books so good they make you lose track of time. And just keep living and making God glad that he gave life to someone who loves and cherishes the gift… And whatever you do, don’t let the wrong things worry you for too long! Read that bolded line above again. It’s one of the core lessons my grandma shared with me and reminded me of frequently in the final few years before she died in 2008. She did so because she loved me, and because, at 90-years-old, she had lived long enough to know that most of us let the little frustrations, drama, and distractions of each day blind us to the beauty in front of us. We get caught up in our own heads, and literally don’t know our lives to be any better than the few things that aren’t going our way. Other times we talk a big talk about a lot of stuff that really doesn’t matter that much. We scrutinize and dramatize the insignificant until we’re blue in the face, and then we sit back and scratch our heads in bewilderment of how unfulfilling life feels. But the older we grow, the quieter we become and the less pointless drama and chaos we engage in. Life humbles us gradually as we age. We realize how much nonsense we’ve wasted time on. Truth be told, the afternoon always understands what the morning never even suspected. Here are some things I learned from my grandma’s wisdom, that I have also gradually validated for myself over the past couple decades — things we all tend to focus on and worry about when we’re younger, that we eventually realize matter a lot less than we originally thought: 99% of what’s stressing you out today won’t matter a month from now. Sooner or later you will know this for certain. So just do your best to let go of the nonsense, stay positive, and move forward with your life. When you set goals and take calculated risks in life, you eventually learn that there will be times when you succeed and there will be times when you fail, and both are equally important in the long run. We learn the way on the way. Understanding the difference between reasonable striving and perfectionism is critical to letting go of fantasies and picking up your life. Perfectionism not only causes you unnecessary stress and anxiety from the superficial need to always “get it right,” it actually prevents you from getting anything worthwhile done at all. Confidence is that inner inertia that propels us to bypass our empty fears and self-doubts. On the road of life, we come to realize that we rarely have confidence when we begin anew, but as we move forward and tap into our inner and outer resources, our confidence gradually builds. A common mistake many young people make is wanting to feel confident before they start something, whether it’s a new job, a new relationship, living in a new city, etc. But it doesn’t happen like that. You have to step out of your comfort zone, and risk your pride, to earn the reward of finding your confidence. Time teaches us that we keep almost nothing in this life until we first give it away. This is true of knowledge, forgiveness, service, love, tolerance, acceptance, and so forth. Most of the time you have to give to receive. Such a simple point, and yet it’s so easy to forget that the giving of ourselves, without a price tag, has to come FIRST! It’s the giving that opens us up to grace and progress. The internet was a lot younger when my grandma caught me debating people in an online bulletin board. And she reminded me right then that while online is fine, if you truly want to make a difference you have to walk the talk too. So don’t just rant online for a better world today. Love your family. Be a good neighbor. Practice kindness. Build bridges. Embody what you preach. When we’re young it seems like faster is better, but in time we witness the power of “slow and steady” at work. We come to learn that no act of love, kindness or generosity, no matter how small, is ever wasted. The fact that you can plant a seed and it becomes a flower, share a bit of knowledge and it becomes another’s, smile at someone and receive a smile in return, is proof that YOU can make a big difference in life and business, even it can’t be done all at once. The older your eyes grow, the more clearly they can see through the smoke and mirrors of every quick fix or short cut. Honestly, I used to believe that making wishes and saying prayers alone changed things, but now I know that wishes and prayers change us, and WE change things. It’s our daily dedication that paves the road of progress. All details aside, when it comes to making a substantial change in your life — building a business, earning a degree, fostering a new relationship, starting a family, becoming more mindful, or any other personal journey that takes time and commitment — one thing you have to ask yourself is: “Am I willing to spend a little time every day like many people won’t, so I can spend the better part of my life like many people can’t?” Think about that for a moment. We ultimately become what we repeatedly do. The acquisition of knowledge doesn’t mean you’re growing — growing happens when what you know changes how you live on a daily basis. (Note: Our newest publication via Penguin Random House, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts and Reflections to Start Every Day”, is a great tool for this kind of daily self-inquiry and self-reflection.) Don’t jam your life with plans. Leave space. Over time you will learn that many great things happen unplanned, and some big regrets happen by not reaching exactly what was planned. So keep your life ordered and your schedule under-booked. Create a foundation with a soft place to land, a wide margin of error, and room to think and breathe every step of the way. The older we get the more we realize how little we actually control. And there’s no good reason to hold yourself down with things you can’t control. Learn to trust the journey, even when you do not understand it. Oftentimes what you never wanted or expected turns out to be what you need. Have you ever met a happy person who regularly evades responsibility, blames and points fingers and makes excuses for their unsatisfying life? Me neither. On the average day happy people accept responsibility for how their lives unfold. They believe their own happiness is a byproduct of their own thinking, beliefs, attitudes, character and behavior. And although it takes time to fully grasp this, it’s a lesson worth learning. They’ll try to measure your worth based on what you have, instead of who you are. But you know better than that — shiny objects and flashy figures don’t matter that much. Don’t just chase the money. Don’t just chase the numbers. Catch up to the ideas and activities that make you come alive. Go for the things of greater value — the things money can’t buy. What matters is having strength of character, an honest heart, and a sense of self-worth. (Note: Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” and “Simplicity” chapters of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.) Some people will never understand, and it’s not your job to teach or change them. Prioritize your peace today. Seriously, you simply can’t save some people from themselves, so don’t get sucked too deep into their drama. Those who make perpetual chaos of their lives won’t appreciate you interfering with the commotion they’ve created anyway. They want your “poor baby” sympathy, but they don’t want to change, at least not yet — they aren’t ready. And again, it’s not your job to rush them. If you take everything personally, you will inevitably be offended for the rest of your life, and that just isn’t worth it. At some point it becomes crystal clear that the way people treat you is their problem, and how you react is yours. Start taking full advantage of the amazing freedom that comes to you when you detach from other people’s opinions and antics. Don’t define your intelligence or self-worth by the number of arguments you have won, but by the number of times you have confidently told yourself, “This nonsense is just not worth it!” Exit swiftly when you must, because not much is worth fighting about for long. And try not to regret the kindness and respect you have shown to the wrong people — your behavior says everything about you, and their behavior says more than enough about them. Carry on, with grace. We all have days when we’re not our best. And the older we grow, the more we realize how important it is to give others the break we hope the world will give us on our own bad days. Truly, you never know what someone has been through in their life, or what they’re going through today. Just be kind, generous and respectful… and then be on your way. As you grow older, what you look like on the outside becomes less and less of an issue, and who you are on the inside becomes the primary point of interest. You eventually realize that true beauty has almost nothing to do with looks — it’s who you are as a person, how you make others feel about themselves, and most importantly, how you feel about yourself. Your personal wish list for big-ticket physical possessions tends to get smaller and smaller as you age into your sunset years, because the things you really want and need are the little things that can’t be bought. It’s nice to have acquaintances, and it’s great to be friendly. But don’t get carried away and spread yourself too thin. Leave plenty of time for those who matter most. Your time is extremely limited, and sooner or later you just want to be around the few people who make you smile for all the right reasons. As time passes, you naturally have more of it behind you and less of it in front of you. The distant future, then, gradually has less value to you personally. But that doesn’t really matter, because the good life always begins right now, when you stop waiting for a better one. Remember, some people wait all day for 5pm, all week for Friday, all year for the holidays, all their lives for happiness, and you don’t be one of them. Right now if LIFE! Don’t miss it. Yes, it’s your turn to walk in my grandma’s footsteps — to live a life that moves and shakes and makes you laugh out loud. Because you don’t want to get to the end, or to tomorrow, even, and realize that your life is a collection of meetings and “somedays” and errands and receipts and empty promises… So count your blessings today, value the people and things that truly matter, and move on from the drama and distractions with your head held high. And before you go, please leave Angel and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay. Your feedback is important to us. 🙂 Which one of the points above resonated the most today?

When you can no longer think of a reason to continue, you must think of a reason to start over. There’s a big difference between giving up and starting over in the right direction. And there are three little words that can release you from your past and guide you forward to a positive new beginning. These words are: “From now on…” So, from now on… Most things are only a part of your life because you keep thinking about them. Realize this. Positive things will happen in your life when you emotionally distance yourself from the negative things. So stop holding on to what hurts, and make room for what feels right. Do not let what is out of your control interfere with all the things you can control. (Read Learned Optimism.) Life is simple on the average day. Everything happens for you, not to you. Everything happens at exactly the right moment, neither too soon nor too late. For everything you lose, you gain something else; and for everything you gain, you lose something else. You don’t have to like it, but it’s just easier if you do. So pay attention to your outlook on life. You can either regret or rejoice; it’s your choice. Change is like breath — it isn’t part of the process, it is the process. In reality the only thing we can count on is change. And the first step toward positive change is to change your outlook. Prepare for the positive. Prepare for progress and the “new.” Allow the unknown to take you to fresh and unforeseen areas in yourself. Growth is impossible without change. If you cannot change your mind, you cannot change anything in your life. Sometimes all you need to do is look at things from a different perspective. When life’s daily struggles knock you into a pit so deep you can’t see anything but darkness, don’t waste valuable energy trying to dig your way out. Because if you hastily dig in the dark, you’re likely to head in the wrong direction and only dig the pit deeper. Instead, use what energy you have to reach out and pull something good in with you. For goodness is bright; its radiance will show you which way is up, and illuminate the correct path that will take you there. (Note: Marc and I discuss strategies for living true to these words in the Adversity & Self-Love chapters of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.) Strength isn’t about bearing a cross of grief or shame. Strength is about choosing your path, living with the consequences, and learning the way on the way. Sometimes you do your best and end up with a mess. When this happens don’t be discouraged. You tried your best. That’s really all you can ever do. You have not failed — you just learned what not to do. So rest, regroup, and begin again with what you now know. Making a big life change or trying something new can be scary. But do you know what’s even scarier? Regret. So realize that most of your fears are much bigger in your mind than they are in reality. You’ll see this for yourself as soon as you face them, so don’t let them stop you. Live your life so that you rarely ever have to regret the chances you never took, the love you never let in, and the gifts you never gave out. Every person who is at the top of the mountain did not fall there from the sky. Good things come to those who work for them. You gain confidence and grow stronger by every experience in which you truly push yourself to do something you didn’t think you could do. If you are standing in that place of in-between, unable or unwilling to go backwards, but too afraid to move forward, remember that you can’t enjoy the view in the long run without being willing to climb at least a few small steps every day. Just because you have struggled does not mean you are incapable. Every success requires some kind of worthy struggle to get there. Give yourself credit for the lessons learned and how far you have come. You’re not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or even a week ago. You’re always learning and growing from your experiences. So use your disappointments and frustrations to motivate you rather than annoy you. Remember, you are in control of the way you respond to life today. Almost nothing is 100% wrong in life. We learn from nearly every step we take. Whatever you did earlier today was a necessary step to get to tomorrow. So be proud of yourself and notice your progress. Maybe you are not as good as you want to be, or as great as you one day will be; but thanks to all the lessons you’ve learned along the way, you are so much better than you used to be. (Note: Our newest publication via Penguin Random House, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts and Reflections to Start Every Day”, is a great tool for this kind of daily self-reflection.) Let’s take a moment to address an obvious elephant in the room — the fact that the aforementioned points are infinitely easier said than done when tragedy strikes. For example, when someone you love passes away too soon, that’s undoubtedly one of the most difficult and heartbreaking endings to cope with. Although it takes a lot more time and work, the general principles for coping with this kind of tragic ending are applicable. Let’s visualize this together… Imagine a person who gave meaning to your life is suddenly no longer in your life (at least not in the flesh), and you’re not the same person without them. You have to change who you are — you’re now a best friend who sits alone, a widow instead of a wife, a dad without a daughter, or a next-door neighbor to someone new. You want life to be the way it was, before death, but it never will be. Marc and I have dealt with the loss of siblings and best friends to illness, so we know from experience that when you lose someone you can’t imagine living without, your heart breaks wide open. And the bad news is you never completely get over the loss — you will never forget them. However, in a backwards way, this is also the good news. You see, death is an ending, which is a necessary part of living. And endings are necessary for beauty too — otherwise it’s impossible to appreciate someone or something, because they are unlimited. Limits illuminate beauty, and death is the definitive limit — a reminder that you need to be aware of this beautiful person or situation, and appreciate this beautiful thing called life. Death is also a beginning, because while you’ve lost someone special, this ending, like every loss, is a moment of reinvention. Although deeply sad, their passing forces you to reinvent your life, and in this reinvention is an opportunity to experience beauty in new, unseen ways and places. And finally, of course, death is an opportunity to celebrate a person’s life, to be grateful for the priceless beauty they showed you, and to begin again in their honor.

Among these items is an old leather-bound journal that she aptly named her Inspiration Journal. Throughout the second half of her life, she used this journal to jot down ideas, thoughts, quotes, song lyrics, and anything else that moved her. She would read excerpts from her journal to me when I was growing up, and I would listen and ask questions. I honestly credit a part of who I am now to the wisdom she bestowed on me when I was young. Although I’ve shared some of her wisdom in the past here on the blog and with our email subscribers, today is the day she became an angel fifteen years ago. So to honor her, I want to share some of my favorite excerpts from her journal with you. I’ve done my best to sort, copyedit, and reorganize her thoughts into twelve inspiring bullet points. I hope you find value in them. No matter where you are or what you’re going through, always believe that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Never expect, assume, or demand. Just do your best, control the elements you can control, and then let it be. Because once you have done what you can, if it is meant to be, it will happen, or it will show you the next step that needs to be taken. Just choose to focus on one thing at a time. You don’t have to do it all, and you don’t have to do it all right now. Breathe, be present, and do your best with what’s in front of you. What you put into life, life will eventually give you back many times over. (Read The Power of Now.) Speak and walk your truth even if your voice and legs shake. By being yourself, you put something beautiful into the world that was not there before. So walk your path confidently and don’t expect anyone else to understand your journey, especially if they have not been exactly where you are going. You’ve been hurt; you’ve gone through numerous ups and downs that have made you who you are today. Over the years, so many things have happened – things that have changed your perspective, taught you lessons, and forced your spirit to grow. As time passes, nobody stays the same, but some people will still tell you that you have changed. Respond to them by saying, “Of course I’ve changed. That’s what life is all about. But I’m still the same person, just a little stronger now than I ever was before.” Circumstances will direct you, correct you, and perfect you over time. So whatever you do, hold on to hope. The tiniest thread will twist into an unbreakable cord. Let hope anchor you in the possibility that this is not the end of your story – that the change in the tides will eventually bring you to peaceful shores. Don’t just educate yourself to be rich, educate yourself to be happy. That way when you get older you’ll know the true value of things, not the price. You will come to realize that the best days are the days when you don’t need anything extreme or special to happen to make you smile. You simply appreciate the moments and feel gratitude, seeking nothing else, nothing more. That is what true happiness is all about in the end. (Note: Our newest publication via Penguin Random House, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts and Reflections to Start Every Day”, is a great tool for daily gratitude and self-reflection.) Understand that the greater part of your misery or unhappiness is determined not by your circumstances, but by your attitude. So smile at those who often try to begrudge or hurt you, show them what’s missing in their life and what they can’t take away from you. Sometimes when a loved one says, “I’m okay,” they need you to look them in the eyes, hug them tight, and reply, “I know you’re not.” And don’t be too upset if some people only seem to remember you when they need you. Feel privileged that you are like a beacon of light that comes to their minds when there is darkness in their lives. Sometimes you have to let a person go so they can grow. Because, over the course of their lives, it is not what you do for them, but what you have taught them to do for themselves that will make them a successful human being. Sometimes getting the results you crave means stripping yourself of people that don’t serve your best interests. This allows you to make space for those who support you in being the absolute best version of yourself. It happens gradually as you grow. You find out who you are and what you want, and then you realize that people you’ve known forever don’t see things the way you do. So you keep the wonderful memories, but find yourself moving on. It’s usually better to look back on life and say, “I can’t believe I did that,” than to look back and say, “I wish I did that.” In the end, people will judge you in some way anyway. So don’t live your life trying to impress others. Instead live your life impressing yourself. Love yourself enough to never lower your standards for anyone. (Read The Last Lecture.) If you’re looking for a happy ending and can’t seem to find one, maybe it’s time to start looking for a new beginning. Brush yourself off and accept that you have to fail from time to time. That’s how you learn. The strongest people out there — the ones who laugh the hardest with a genuine smile — are the same people who have fought the toughest battles. They’re smiling because they’ve decided that they’re not going to let anything hold them down, they’re moving on to a new beginning. As I’m wrapping up this short tribute to my grandmother, I’m reminded of a poem excerpt by Christian D. Larson that she used to have hanging on her refrigerator when I was a kid. As soon as I was old enough to understand the poem, my grandmother made a photocopy of it for me, and over 30 years later I still have that same photocopy laminated and hanging on my office bulletin board. Although I’ve shared this poem in past blog posts over the years, I wanted to re-share it here, as these are words my grandmother said she strived to live by: “Promise Yourself… To think only the best, to work only for the best,and to do the best you can.To be just as enthusiastic about the success of othersas you are about your own. To forgive the mistakes of the pastand press on to greater achievements in the present.To wear a friendly countenance at all timesand give every living creature you meet a smile. To give so much time to the improvement of yourselfthat you have no time to criticize others.To be too focused for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear,and too at peace to permit the presence of trouble. To think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world,not in loud words but great deeds.To live in faith that the whole world is on your sideso long as you are true to the best that is in you.” (Note: Angel and I discuss strategies for living true to these words in the Happiness & Self-Love chapters of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.)

"5 Painfully Obvious Truths We Tend to Forget When Life Gets Messy|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/5-obvious-truths.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| The truth does not cease to exist when it is forgotten. You know how you can read or hear something dozens of times in dozens of different ways before it finally sinks in? The little truths listed below fall firmly into that category — timeless life lessons that many of us likely learned years ago, and have been reminded of ever since, yet for whatever reason we tend to forget in the heat of the moment. This, my friends, is my attempt at helping all of us, myself included, “get it” and “remember it” once and for all, especially as we collectively cope with all the evolving chaos in our world today… We know deep down that life is short, and that death will happen to all of us eventually, and yet we are infinitely surprised when it happens to someone we know. It’s like walking up a flight of stairs with a distracted mind, and misjudging the final step. You expected there to be one more stair than there is, and so you find yourself off balance for a moment, before your mind shifts back to the present moment and how the world really is. So let that reminder be a wake-up call to LIVE your life TODAY! Don’t ignore death, but don’t be afraid of life either. Be afraid of a life you never lived because you were too afraid to take positive action today. Death is not the greatest loss in life, neither is injury. The greatest loss is what dies inside you while you’re still alive and capable. So even when life gets messy, be bold, be courageous, be a scared to death, and then take the next step anyway. Invest your heart and soul into whatever you have right in front of you. Bring passion into otherwise ordinary moments… Love what you do, until you can do what you love. Love where you are, until you can be where you love. Love the people you’re with, until you can be with the people you love most. This is the way we find more happiness, opportunity, and peace on the average day. Embrace change and realize that, although messy, in many ways it’s necessary. It won’t always be obvious at first, but in the end most forms of change are worthwhile because they force us to grow. So keep yourself in check right now… What you have today may become what you had by tomorrow. You never know. Things change, often spontaneously. People and circumstances come and go. Life doesn’t stop for anybody. It moves rapidly and rushes from calm to chaos in a matter of seconds, and happens like this to people every day. It’s likely happening to someone nearby right now. Sometimes the shortest split second in time changes the direction of our lives. A seemingly innocuous decision rattles our whole world like a meteorite striking Earth. Entire lives have been swiveled and flipped upside down, for better or worse, on the strength of an unpredictable event. And these events are always happening — like all the senseless violence and drama we see in our world today. So just remember, however good or bad a situation is now, it will change. That’s the one thing you can count on. Accept it. Breathe. Be where you are. You’re where you need to be right now. There’s a time and place for everything, and every hard step is necessary. Just keep doing your best, and don’t force what’s not yet supposed to fit into your life. When it’s meant to be, it will be. Have patience with everything that remains imperfect or unfinished in your head and heart. And realize that patience is not about waiting, but the ability to keep a good attitude while working hard to stay true to your intuition and values. This is your life, and it is governed by your choices. May your actions speak louder than your words. May your daily choices preach louder than your lips. May your inner sense of satisfaction be your noise in the end. And if your present life only teaches you one thing, let it be that taking a passionate leap is always worth it. Even if you have no idea where you’re going to land — even when there are so many unknowns — be brave enough to stand up and listen to your heart. Remember that the most powerful moments in life happen when you find the courage to let go of what can’t be changed. Because as Viktor Frankl said, when you are no longer able to change a situation, you are challenged to change yourself — to grow beyond the unchangeable. And that changes everything! (Note: Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Passion and Growth” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Hard times are like strong storms that blow against you. And it’s not just that these storms hold you back from places you are trying to go. They also tear away from you all but the essential parts of your ego that cannot be torn, so that you are left only with the foundation of who you really are. Ultimately you realize you are here to endure these storms, to sacrifice your time and risk your heart. You are here to be bruised by life. And when it happens that you are hurt, or betrayed, or rejected, let yourself sit quietly with your eyes closed and remember all the good times you had, and all the sweetness you tasted, and everything you learned. Tell yourself how amazing it was to live, and then open your eyes and live some more. Because to never struggle would be to never grow. You must let go of who you were so you can become who you are. Again, it is within the depths of the strongest and darkest storms that you often discover within you an inextinguishable light, and it is this light that illuminates the path forward. Accept the feeling of not knowing exactly where you are going, and train yourself to love and appreciate this sensation of freedom. Because it is only when you are suspended in the air, with no destination in sight, that you force your wings to open fully so you can fly. And as you soar around you still may not know where you’re traveling to. But that’s not what’s important. What’s important is the opening of your wings. You may not know where you’re going, but you know that so long as your wings are spread, the winds will carry you forward. Truth be told, some of the greatest outcomes that transpire in your life will be the ones you never even knew you wanted. As long as you keep your mind open to new perspectives and yourself moving forward, there really are no totally wrong turns in life, only paths you didn’t know you were meant to travel. And you never can be certain what’s around the corner.  It could be everything, or it could be nothing. You keep gliding steadily forward, and then one day you realize you’ve come a long way from where you started. All details aside, someday all the pieces will come together. Unimaginably good outcomes will likely transpire in your life, even if everything doesn’t turn out exactly the way you had anticipated. And you will look back at the messy times that have passed, smile, and ask yourself… “How in the world did I get through all of that?” Yes, it’s your turn to forgive yourself for the bad decisions you made, for the times you lacked understanding, for the choices that innocently hurt others and yourself along the way. Forgive yourself for being young and reckless. These are all vital lessons. And what matters most right now is your willingness to get back out there today and grow from them. But before you go, please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay. Your feedback is important to us. 🙂 Which one of the points above resonated the most today?

The Secret Habits of Optimists: 6 Hidden Practices They Live By|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/secrets-be-optimistic.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| Be mindful. Be grateful. Be positive. Be true. Be kind. If the grass looks greener on the other side… Stop staring. Stop comparing. Stop complaining. And START watering the grass you’re standing on… Truly, the most powerful weapon against stress on the average day is our ability to choose one thought or response over another. I was reminded of this today when a reader named Sarah sent me the following in an email (I’m sharing this with permission): “I sat down with my two daughters, ages six and eight, this afternoon to explain to them that we have to move out of our four-bedroom house and into a two-bedroom apartment for a year or two until I can find another job and build our savings back up. It’s a conversation I’ve been avoiding for over a month, as I’ve struggled with the doubts and regrets of not being able to provide a financially stable household for us. But my daughters just looked at each other after I told them, and then my youngest daughter turned to me and asked, ‘Are we all moving into that apartment together?’ ‘Of course,’ I immediately replied. ‘Oh, so no big deal then,’ she said.” Is that not the most mindful, optimistic response imaginable? I hope it inspires you to train your mind to see the good in everything, even when it’s hard. The peace and happiness of your life in the long run heavily depends on the quality of your daily thoughts and responses. Optimism is your choice today. It’s not an inborn trait bestowed on a lucky few — it’s a skill that can be learned and honed. Let those two little girls be your guides, and allow this short read to fill in the gaps… Since there is no one-size-fits-all, step-by-step guide to being more optimistic, I’ve compiled a short list of strategies that we’ve successfully implemented with our course students, coaching clients, and live event attendees over the past 15 years. Here are some little things they now do differently, mostly behind the scenes: Most people get irritated by those who seem “too optimistic,” but this is often just an unfortunate misinterpretation of the difference between an optimist and an idealist. An optimist is really just a positive realist who is neither naive, nor in denial, nor blind to the realities of life. An optimist believes in the optimal usage of all the available options no matter how narrow the supply. As a result, optimistic people are able to better see the bigger picture.  They can more accurately visualize and mange the present possibilities. For comparison’s sake: An idealist focuses only on the absolute best aspects of situations, a pessimist sees no positive possibilities at all, and an optimist strives to see all the possibilities so they can find the best possible option among them. So when picking lemons off a lemon tree, an idealist reaches for the ripest looking lemon and expects it to be the tastiest, a pessimist settles for whichever one is closest, while an optimist picks all the lemons in sight and makes lemonade. (Note: Angel and I further discuss this habit of optimism in the Happiness chapter of our New York Times bestseller, “Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs”.) As a child you impressed and inspired yourself on a daily basis. You ran, jumped, swung, sang, and danced openly without a care in the world — without worrying about what everyone else thought of you. You didn’t need anyone else’s constant approval, because deep down you knew you were amazing. But as you grew into adulthood the pressure from peers, popular media, and society as a whole began to wear on you. You started comparing yourself to everyone around you. You judged and measured your body, your lifestyle, your career, and your relationships against other people’s lives. And when you realized that many of these people have things that you do not, bitterness set in and you gradually stopped appreciating all the great things you do have in your life. Optimists defend themselves against this self-dislike in two primary ways. First, they get back to trusting their own intuition when it comes to their daily activities. They stop asking for everyone else’s approval and simply do what they know in their heart feels right. Second, optimists don’t judge themselves against a set of unrealistic, third-party ideals. They let go of the ideals and instead hold on to the belief that they are always good enough just the way they are, even as they grow into stronger, wiser versions of themselves. In order to be optimistic you have to be generally content with your life. In order to find this contentment, you have to look within yourself. Happiness after all is mostly an inside job. If you constantly look for happiness outside yourself, by tying it to a specific achievement you must reach for example, you have two big problems: Optimists set boundaries and disconnect long-term achievement from daily happiness — they give themselves permission to enjoy each moment without the need for anything more. This isn’t to say that they are complacent. They still set goals, build habits, help others, and grow, but they learn to indulge joyously in the journey, not the destination. In the long run you are only as good as the company you keep, and misery loves company. So do yourself a favor and dodge other people’s negativity as often as you can. Remember that optimism is a learned habit and it is positively contagious. Surround yourself with positive, emotionally supportive friends and family — people who could infect you with their optimism, so you can then pay it forward… How can you pay it forward? Be kind and positive right now, right here, in your own life, in whatever way you can. Just be kind and positive. There’s so much going on that we cannot solve — so many people we can’t help. But your kindness and optimism can make a significant difference, in your own life above all, and in the lives you touch. (Note: Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the Relationships chapter of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.) Just because you’re an optimist doesn’t mean you’re not going to have bad days. You will have plenty of bad days, that’s reality. Life isn’t always rainbows and butterflies. A foundation of realism keeps things in perspective and helps prevent things from being blown out of proportion. Expecting life to be wonderful all the time is wanting to swim in an ocean in which waves only rise up and never come crashing down. However, when you recognize that the rising and crashing waves are part of the exact same ocean, you are able to let go and be at peace with the reality of these ups and downs. It becomes clear that life’s ups require life’s downs. Bottom line: Prepare for the downs but capitalize on the ups; the former makes you sensible and the latter makes you an optimist. (Read Learned Optimism.) It’s not always what happens that determines your mood, but how you express what happens that counts. For instance, when an optimist experiences a bout of success she might say, “That’s just as I had anticipated; I studied hard and my diligence paid off,” while a pessimist might say, “Wow, was I lucky to get such a good grade on that test,” not giving herself any credit and literally snatching her own defeat from the hands of victory. If an optimist encounters a do-it-yourself project she can’t figure out, she’s likely to say something like, “Either the instructions I’m following are unclear, or this project is going to require a bit more effort than I thought… or maybe I’m just having a rough moment here.” In other words, an optimist uses positive self-talk to keep the struggle outside herself (“the instructions”), specific (“more effort”), and temporary (“a rough moment”), while the pessimist would likely get down on herself and interpret the same struggle as internal, widespread, and everlasting. Go ahead and follow in the optimist’s footsteps by speaking to yourself in a more positive way regardless of whether you succeed or fail, and you’ll gradually become more optimistic. Physical body language is also important. Your smile actually influences your mood in a positive way. When you feel down, your brain tells your face that you’re sad, and your facial muscles respond by putting on a frown, which in turn conveys a message back to your brain that says, “Yep, we’re feeling unhappy.” On the average day (when nothing extreme is happening) you can flip the switch on this internal reaction by adjusting your facial muscles into a smile so they don’t correspond to what you’re feeling. This is a clever way of sending a different message back to your brain: “Hey, life is still pretty good and I’m doing OK.” And you’ll actually begin to feel a little better, gradually. Yes, it’s your turn to declare this day a worthy one! So let’s start the rest of the day off right with renewed energy and an attitude that things will keep flourishing and getting better. Let’s be hopeful, optimistic, and focused on staying positive and taking consistent positive action… And before you go, please leave Angel and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay and it’s ideas for creating optimism.

Train yourself to see and be the good in this day. A couple thousand years ago in ancient Greece, the great philosopher Socrates was strolling contemplatively around a community garden when a neighbor walked up to him and said, “You’re never in a million years going to believe what I just heard about our mutual friend…” “Wait,” Socrates interrupted, putting his hand up in the air. “Before you continue with this story, your words must pass the triple filter test?” “The what?” “The triple filter test,” Socrates said. The neighbor just stared at him with a blank expression. Socrates continued, “The first filter is Truth. Are you absolutely sure the story you are about to tell me is true?” “Well, no,” the neighbor said, “I literally just heard it from someone else I know.” “Ah-ha…” Socrates quickly replied, “then let’s move on to the second filter. Is what you are about to share Good in any way, shape or form?” “No… no,” the neighbor said, “This story is actually quite…” Before he could finish his sentence, Socrates interrupted him again, “Ahh, so it may not be true and it is definitely not good.” “That’s right,” the neighbor assured him. “Well, you may still be able to save yourself,” Socrates said. “Is anything about the story you want to share Useful?” The neighbor stared blankly again for a moment and then said, “No, I suppose it’s not really…” “So, you want to tell me something that may not be true, is definitely not good, and is not useful to know?” Socrates asked. The neighbor looked down at the ground and nodded. “Well, you have no good reason to tell me this story, and you have no good reason to believe it yourself,” Socrates added, as the neighbor dolefully walked away. In many ways, not too much has changed since ancient Greece, especially when it comes to the stories we tell ourselves and each other. Every single day we invest valuable time into drama, hearsay, and empty worries. Many of us plug into social media first thing in the morning for reasons that have zero to do with what is true for us, good for us, and useful for those around us. Instead, we do it mostly just to distract ourselves… from ourselves and the good work in front of us. In an expansive universe in which there are abundant opportunities to discover what’s true, what’s good, and what’s useful, when we do the opposite we know it. And while making that compromise is tolerable for a little while, eventually it isn’t anymore. Our negligence catches up to us, and we begin to feel off-center and regretful of the choices we’ve made. Don’t fall into this trap going forward. Instead take Socrates’ advice: simply focus on what is true, good, and useful. It worked well for Socrates a couple thousand years ago, and I assure you it continues to work well for many people today. So when the going gets a little tough, ask… In a very real sense, the stories we tell ourselves change what we see in front of us. When we enter an experience with a story about how life is, that tends to be what we see, even when there’s plenty of evidence to the contrary. I was reminded of this recently by an attendee at our Think Better, Live Better conference’s digital ticket holders… She compared her present marital problems and stress to an old parable in which a group of blind men touch an elephant for the very first time to learn what it’s like. Each one of them feels a different part of the elephant, but only that one part, such as the leg, trunk, side, or tusk. Then the men compare notes and learn that they are in complete disagreement about what an elephant looks like — lots of tension and drama quickly arises between them.  Something similar happens through our wide-ranging, different past experiences. Some of us have been deeply heartbroken. Some of us have lost our parents, siblings, or someone we love to accidents and illnesses. Some of us have dealt with infidelity. Some of us have been fired from jobs we relied on. Some of us have been discriminated against because of our gender or race. And, when we enter a new experience that arouses prominent memories of our own painful story from the past, it shifts our perspective in the present — it drastically narrows it. When a negative past experience narrows our present perspective, it’s mostly just a defense mechanism. Every day of our lives we are presented with some level of uncertainty, and our innate human defense mechanisms don’t like this one bit. So our minds try to compensate by filling in the gaps of information by clinging to the stories we already feel comfortable with. We end up subconsciously trying to make better sense of everything in the present by using old stories as filler. And while this approach works sometimes, other times our stories are completely irrelevant to the present moment, so they end up hurting us and those we love far more than they help. Thus, my challenge for you is this: Whenever you feel a bit off-center, try to bring more awareness to the story you’re telling yourself, and then practice detaching from it. Go deeper into reality. Don’t just look at the surface. Investigate. Observe without presupposing… Can you be absolutely certain the story is true? Think about how you feel and behave when you tell yourself the story. Then consider what else you might see (or experience) in the present moment if you removed the story from your mind. For example, what’s the opposite of the story and is there any truth in the opposite, too? Do your best to think better — to give yourself some healthy perspective — so you can ultimately live better despite the challenges you face. “A 10-year-old patient of mine will be undergoing her 14th surgery in three years’ time to combat a rare and aggressive type of cancer. Even after all the medical procedures and surgeries, I’ve never seen her frown — I’ve never seen her skip a beat. Although the odds continue to work against her, I’m certain her attitude, acceptance and presence are the principal reasons she has lived so well to this point. She’s still positively engaged in living her life to the fullest. She laughs and plays with her friends and family. She has realistic, intelligent goals for the upcoming year that she’s already working on. A kid like her who can go through everything she’s been through and wake up every day with enthusiasm for the life she’s living, is the reason I’m doing my best to focus on the good and better my perspective on life.” That’s the opening paragraph of an email I received recently from a new course student and reader named Michelle. It caught my attention for obvious reasons. (Note: I’m sharing this with permission of course.) Michelle went on to say, “My conversations with this incredible little girl have opened my awareness to all the self-destructive delusions I have in my head. I honestly have it so good — I am incredibly fortunate to be alive and healthy, for example — and yet I sit at home most nights thinking the opposite. I don’t necessarily do this consciously or intensely, but I do it. I think about how my life ‘should’ be different than it is — how everything should be better, easier, more enjoyable, and so forth. And these delusions are slowly spoiling my attitude and my ability to make progress on things that are important to me.” Wow! Talk about a great reminder for all of us to get out of our own heads. And the truth is, most of us come to similar realizations at some point. The older we grow, and the more real-world tragedies and challenges we witness, the more we realize how incredibly blessed we are, and how frequently the delusions in our heads hold us back from our blessings. So today, I challenge you to move through this day and practice seeing and accepting life as it truly is, without any delusions. Do what you have to do without worry and fearing the worst, lamenting about what might happen, or obsessing over how difficult your life is. Be present, take it one step at a time, and do the best you can. If you don’t know where to start, simply look around and focus on a few things that are good right now… The truth is you’re doing better than a lot of people in this world. And while you may not have ALL of the aforementioned right now, you get the idea. So remember to be grateful for the things you DO have. Because in the end, the secret to being grateful is no secret. You choose to be grateful for the little things, again and again. (Read “1,000 Little Tings Happy, Successful People Do Differently“.) To attract better outcomes, you have to become better on both the inside and outside. Your actions matter! You can’t do the same things expect positive change. You can’t blame someone else either. Take full responsibility for the next step. Start transforming your mindset, then start upgrading your habits. Your life is 90% your choice! Think about it… Have you ever told yourself that you’re going to do something useful or make something happen and then nothing happened? All details aside, it’s because you didn’t have the right habits in place — the little things you do every day that build up to something bigger. Your habits truly make or break you. Because in all walks of life you become what you habitually do. You will never make progress or change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret to your success is always found in your daily habits and routines. In other words, regardless of your unique life situation or how you personally define success, you can’t become an overnight success. You become successful over time from all the little things you do one day at a time. Failure occurs in the same way. All your little daily failures (that you don’t learn and grow from) come together and cause you to fail… And then one day you wake up and your business has failed. It was all the little things you did or didn’t do along the way — your daily habits — not just one big catastrophic event. Let this be your wake-up call. Your life is your business! Your habits are your business! If you feel a like you’ve wasted too much time doing things that are NOT useful, this quick actionable exercise is for YOU. Choose any area in your life that you want to improve, and then: (Note: If you appreciated the questions and exercise above, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts and Reflections to Start Every Day” is a great tool for bringing more daily self-inquiry and self-reflection into your routine.) Yes, it’s your turn to not fall back into your old patterns of living simply because they’re more comfortable and easier to access. It’s your turn to remember that you’re leaving certain habits and situations behind for a reason: to improve yourself — because you can’t move forward if you keep going back. And, it’s undoubtedly your turn to ask the questions above, again and again, so you can bring more of what’s TRUE, GOOD, and USEFUL into your life.

"One Simple Perspective Shift that Will Change the Way You See the World|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/simple-perspective-shift.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| As human beings, we subconsciously tell ourselves stories pretty much every waking minute of our lives. And these stories we tell ourselves don’t just change how we feel, they actually change what we see, what we experience, and what we know to be true. This is one of the primary reasons multiple people can go through the same experience, but interpret it differently. Each of us may enter a shared experience with a different story echoing through our mind, and our unique story — our inner dialog — alters the way we feel. So each of us exits this shared experience with a different perspective on what just happened. And sometimes these differences literally make all the difference in the world. If we want to get on the same page with each other, and garner a better understanding of reality, we have to do a little work… In a way, the stories we tell ourselves narrow our perspective. When we enter an experience with a story about how life is, that tends to be all we see. This phenomenon reminds me of an old parable in which a group of blind men touch an elephant for the very first time to learn what it’s like. Each one of them feels a different part of the elephant, but only that one part, such as the leg, trunk, side, or tusk. Then the men eagerly compare notes and quickly learn that they are in complete disagreement about what an elephant looks like.  Something similar happens through our wide-ranging, different past experiences. Some of us have been deeply heartbroken. Some of us have lost our parents, siblings, or children to accidents and illnesses. Some of us have dealt with infidelity. Some of us have been fired from jobs we relied on. Some of us have been discriminated against because of our gender or race. And when we enter a new experience that arouses prominent memories of our own painful story from the past, it shifts our perspective in the present — it narrows it. When a negative past experience narrows our present perspective, it’s mostly just a defense mechanism. Every day of our lives we are presented with some level of uncertainty, and our innate human defense mechanisms don’t like this one bit. So our minds try to compensate by filling in the gaps of information with stories we already feel comfortable with. We end up subconsciously trying to make better sense of everything in the present by using old stories from past experiences as filler. And while this approach works sometimes, other times our old stories and past experiences are completely irrelevant to the present moment, so they end up hurting us far more than they help. This is where a little reframing can work wonders. Over the past decade Angel and I have successfully guided hundreds of our course students through various reframing tools that have been proven to change our thoughts, broaden our perspectives, and shift our story lines in a positive direction. Doing so has helped these students feel better, think better, and gradually get their lives and relationships back on track. Today I want to take a brief look at one of these reframing tools with you… Many of the biggest misunderstandings in life could be avoided if we would simply take the time to ask, “What else could this mean?” And while that question alone can help us reframe our thoughts and broaden our perspectives, using the simple phrase “The story I’m telling myself…” as a prefix to troubling thoughts has undoubtedly created more “aha moments” for our students in recent times. Here’s how it works… “The story I’m telling myself…” can be applied to any difficult life situation, or any circumstance in which a troubling thought is getting the best of you. For example, perhaps someone you love (husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, etc.) didn’t call you on their lunch break when they said they would, and now an hour has passed and you’re feeling upset because you’re obviously not a high enough priority to them. When you catch yourself feeling this way, use the phrase: “The story I’m telling myself is that they didn’t call me simply because I’m not a high enough priority to them.” Then ask yourself: Give yourself the space to think it all through carefully. Mull it over, mindfully. On the average day, I bet your answer to question #1 is “no,” and your answer to #2 is “not very good.” And I hope question #3 gets you doing more of… “I don’t know why they haven’t called yet, but maybe…” “The story I’m telling myself…” and the three related questions gives you a tool for revisiting and reframing the troubling or confusing situations that arise in your daily life. From there you can challenge the stories you’re subconsciously telling yourself and reality-check them with a more objective mindset, which ultimately allows you to make better decisions about everything. Detach yourself from the stories you’ve been subconsciously telling yourself. Go deeper into reality. Don’t just look at the surface. Investigate and observe without presupposing. Change the way you see the world… Who knows what you’ll see when you stop looking through a lens drastically narrowed by half-truths, and you start seeing things with a clearer mind. Maybe you’ll start seeing things you never saw before. Maybe you’ll start experiencing things you never experienced before. Maybe you’ll learn lots of new lessons you needed to learn. And maybe you’ll gradually become the person you always knew you could be. At the very least, I hope this post reminds you that positive thinking isn’t about expecting the best to happen every time – it’s about accepting what happens every time, being mindful, and making the very best of it. The way you think about things makes all the difference! So, I’ll leave you with this… A puppy thinks: “Hey, these people I live with feed me, love me, provide me with a warm, dry home, pet me and take good care of me… … THEY MUST BE GODS!”  A kitten thinks: “Hey, these people I live with feed me, love me, provide me with a warm, dry home, pet me and take good care of me… … I MUST BE A GOD!” Same situation, different thinking. To a great extent, we make our own life stories by our thoughts. The reality we ultimately create is a process of our daily thinking. And when our daily thinking is right, our daily actions can’t be wrong in the long run.  (Angel and I build actionable, mindset-shifting daily rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy Course, and we also establish a daily habit of perspective change in our newest publication through Penguin Random House, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts & Reflections to Start Every Day”.) Yes, it’s your turn to make your own life story today, with the right perspective! But before you go we would love to hear from YOU. Which part of this essay resonates with you the most today?

Trying to be anyone else is a waste of the person you are. Embrace that individual inside you that has ideas, strengths, and beauty like no one else. Be the person you know yourself to be — the best version of you — on your terms. And above all, be true to YOU — if you cannot put your heart in it, take yourself out of it. Starting today… Twenty years from now it won’t really matter what shoes you wore today, how your hair looked, or what brand of jeans you bought. What will matter is how you loved, what you learned and how you applied this knowledge. If you really want good things in your life to happen, you have to make them happen yourself. You can’t sit around and hope that somebody else will help you; you have to make your own future and not think that your destiny is tied to the actions and choices of others. (Note: Our newest publication, “The Good Morning Journal”, is a great tool for daily progress-tracking and self-reflection.) When someone treats you like you’re just one of many options, help them narrow their choice by removing yourself from the equation. Sometimes you have to try not to care, no matter how much you do. Because sometimes you can mean almost nothing to someone who means so much to you. It’s not pride — it’s self-respect. Don’t expect to see positive changes in your life if you surround yourself with negative people. Don’t give part-time people a full-time position in your life. Know your value and what you have to offer. Perspective is everything. When faced with long check-out lines, traffic jams, or waiting an hour past your appointment time, you have two choices: You can get frustrated and enraged, or you can view it as life’s way of giving you a guilt-free breather from rushing, and spend that time daydreaming, conversing, or watching the clouds. The first choice will raise your blood pressure. The second choice will raise your consciousness. Learn to let go of things you can’t control. The next time you’re tempted to rant about a situation that you think ended unfairly, remind yourself of this: You’ll never kill off your anger by beating the story to death. So close your mouth, unclench your fists, and redirect your thoughts. When left untended, life’s little frustrations will slowly wither, and you’ll be left to live in peace as you grow toward a better future. Some things just don’t matter much — like the kind of car you drive. How big of a deal is that in the grand scheme of life? Not a big deal at all. But lifting a person’s heart? Now that matters! The whole problem with most people is, they KNOW what matters, but they don’t CHOOSE it. They get distracted. They don’t put first things first. Don’t be one of them! The hardest and smartest way to live is choosing what truly matters, and pursuing it a little bit every day. (Read The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.) Let someone love you just the way you are — as flawed as you might be, as unattractive as you sometimes feel, and as unaccomplished as you think you are. Yes, let someone love you despite all of this, and let that someone be YOU. Be confident being YOU. We often waste too much time comparing ourselves to others, and wishing to be something we’re not. Everybody has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it is only when we accept everything we are, and aren’t, that we are able to become who we are truly capable of being. You were born to be real, not to be perfect. You’re here to be YOU, not to be what someone else wants you to be. So stand up for yourself, look them in the eye when you must, and say, “Don’t judge me until you know me, don’t underestimate me until you challenge me fairly, and don’t talk about me until you’ve talked to me.” You can’t expect to change people. Either you accept who they are, or you start living your life without them. And just because something ends, doesn’t mean it never should have been. You lived, you learned, you grew, and you moved on. Some people and situations come into your life as blessings, while others come into your life as lessons. How do you build credibility? It’s not rocket science. Be honest. Follow through. Honor your word. Say sorry. Listen. Be kind and respectful. And remember that when you’re in a healthy relationship, being faithful on a daily basis isn’t a sacrifice, it’s a joy. Seriously, do not underestimate the power of a loving touch, a kind word, or an honest compliment, all of which have the power to turn a life around. Life as we know it can change in a blink of an eye. Unlikely friendships can blossom, important careers can be tossed aside, and a long lost hope can be rekindled. It might feel a little uncomfortable at times, but know that life begins at the end of your comfort zone. So if you’re feeling uncomfortable right now, know that the change taking place in your life is not an ending, but a new beginning. (Read The Power of Full Engagement.) Don’t get to the end of your life and find that you lived only the length of it; live the width of it as well. When it comes to living as a passionate, inspired human being, the only challenge greater than learning to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes, is learning to walk a lifetime comfortably in your own. Follow your heart and take your brain with you. When you are truly comfortable in your own skin, not everyone will like you, but you won’t care about it one bit. Strength shows not only in the ability to hold on, but in the ability to start over when you must. It is never too late to become what you might have been. Keep learning, adapting, and growing. You may not be there yet, but you are closer than you were yesterday. So keep going, and be low-key sometimes. You don’t need to put everything on social media. Silently progress and let your positive actions speak for themselves. Do your best to live a life that moves, shakes, and makes you laugh out loud every day. Because you don’t want to get to the end, or to tomorrow even, and realize that your life is a collection of meetings and “somedays” and errands and receipts and empty promises. Go ahead and sing out loud in the car with the windows down, and dance in your living room, and stay up late laughing, and paint your walls any color you want, and enjoy some sweet wine and chocolate cake. Yes, and go ahead and sleep in on clean white sheets, and throw parties, and paint, and write poetry, and read books so good they make you lose track of time. And just keep living and making God glad that he gave life to someone who loves and cherishes the gift… Yes, it’s your turn to make the very best of it today! But before you go we would love to hear from YOU. Which point mentioned above resonates with you the most today? Please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay.

Here are ten life choices that ultimately lead to that phrase of regret, and how to elude them on the average day: If the face you always show the world is a mask, someday there will be nothing beneath it. Because when you spend too much time concentrating on everyone else’s perception of you, or who everyone else wants you to be, you eventually forget who you really are. So don’t fear the judgments of others; you know in your heart who you are and what’s true to you. You don’t have to be perfect to impress and inspire people.  Let them be impressed and inspired by how you deal with your imperfections. The greatest challenge in life is discovering who you are; the second greatest is being happy with what you find. A big part of this is your decision to stay true to your own goals and dreams. Do you have people who disagree with you? Good. It means you’re standing your ground and walking your own path. Sometimes you’ll do things considered crazy by others, but when you catch yourself excitedly losing track of time, that’s when you’ll know you’re doing the right thing.  (Read The 4-Hour Workweek.) Don’t let someone who has a bad attitude give it to you. Don’t let them get to you. They can’t philosophically pull the trigger if you don’t hand them the ammo. When you remember that keeping the constant company of negative people is a choice, instead of an obligation, you free yourself to keep the company of compassion instead of anger, generosity instead of greed, and patience instead of anxiety. A life filled with loving deeds and good character is the best tombstone. Those who you inspired and shared your love with will remember how you made them feel long after your time has expired. So carve your name on hearts, not stone. What you have done for yourself alone dies with you; what you have done for others and the world remains. If you want to know your past look into your present conditions. If you want to know your future look into your present actions. You must let go of the old to make way for the new; the old way is gone, never to come back. If you acknowledge this right now and take steps to address it, you will position yourself for lasting success. (Note: Our newest publication, “The Good Morning Journal”, is a great tool for this kind of daily self-reflection.) There are no failures, just results. Even if things don’t unfold the way you had expected, don’t be disheartened or give up. Learn what you can and move on. The one who continues to advance one step at a time will win in the end. Because the battle is always won far away and long before the final victory. It’s a process that occurs with small steps, decisions, and actions that gradually build upon each other and eventually lead to that glorious moment of triumph. Life should be touched, not strangled. Sometimes you’ve got to relax and let life happen without incessant worry and micromanagement. Learn to let go a little before you squeeze too tight. Take a deep breath. When the dust settles and you can once again see the forest for the trees, take the next step forward. You don’t have to know exactly where you’re going to be headed somewhere great. Everything in life is in perfect order whether you understand it yet or not. It just takes some time to connect all the dots. Be strong enough to let go and wise enough to wait for what you deserve. Sometimes you have to get knocked down lower than you have ever been to stand up taller than you ever were before. Sometimes your eyes need to be washed by your tears so you can see the possibilities in front of you with a clearer vision again. Don’t settle. The trouble is, you always think you have more time than you do. But one day you will wake up and there won’t be any more time to work on the things you’ve always wanted to do. And at that point you either will have achieved the goals you set for yourself, or you will have a list of excuses for why you haven’t. (Read The Last Lecture.) The world doesn’t owe you anything, you owe the world something. So stop daydreaming and start DOING. As they say, develop a backbone not a wishbone. Take full responsibility for your life – take control your next step. You are important and you are needed. It’s too late to sit around and wait for somebody to do something someday. Someday is now; the somebody the world needs is YOU. The points above are crucial reminders, but what if you already have regrets you’re struggling with? No doubt, feelings of regret sometimes sneak up on us. Oftentimes we regret things simply because we worry that we should have made different decisions in the past. We should have done a better job, but didn’t. We should have given a relationship another chance, but didn’t. We should have started that business, but didn’t… We compare the real outcomes of our past decisions to an ideal fantasy of how things “should” be. The problem, of course, is that we can’t change those decisions because we can’t change the past. Yet we resist this reality subconsciously — we keep overanalyzing and comparing the unchangeable reality to our ideal fantasy until we’ve wasted lots of time and energy. But why? If we logically know better, why can’t we just let all our ideals and fantasies GO? Because we identify personally with these ideals and fantasies. We all have this vision in our minds of who we are — our well-meaning intentions, our intelligence, our social impact, etc. And we make the best decisions we can of course because, again, we generally mean well. Even if you struggle with deep-seeded self-esteem issues, you probably still identify with yourself as being a decent and respectful human being. And so when someone says something about us that contradicts the vision of ourselves that we identify with — they insult our intentions, our intelligence, our status, etc. — we take offense. We feel personally attacked, and we have a hard time letting it go. Something very similar happens when we believe we did something — made a mistake — that contradicts the same vision of ourselves that we identify with. We take offense! In some cases we implode on ourselves — we berate ourselves for making the mistake: “How could I have done this?” we think. “Why couldn’t I have been smarter and made a better decision?” And again, we have a hard time letting it go — we have a hard time coming to grips with the fact that we aren’t always as good as the vision we have of ourselves. So in a nutshell, our ideals and fantasies about ourselves tend to cause us lots of misery. The key is to gradually practice letting go of these ideals and fantasies, and focus instead on making the best of reality. The truth must be embraced… Of course, all of this is easier said than done, but whenever you find yourself obsessing over and regretting a past decision, you can 1) acknowledge that you’re falling into this pattern, 2) realize that there’s some ideal or fantasy you’re comparing your decisions and yourself to, and 3) practice letting go of this ideal or fantasy and embrace a wider range of reality in the present moment. One day you will find yourself close to the end, thinking about the beginning. TODAY is that beginning! TODAY is the first day of the rest of your life. I challenge you to put the principles of this article to good use. Motivate yourself to START NOW by answering a simple question: What’s one thing YOU CAN choose to do today that you will NOT regret?

Noriega 20 Things You Need to Stop Wasting Your Time On|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/25-things-stop-wasting-time.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| “Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time, for that’s the stuff life is made of.”— Benjamin Franklin I recently received a thank you email from a reader and course student named Hope. She said our work helped motivate her through an arduous recovery process following a serious car accident last year. Although her entire story was both heartbreaking and inspiring, this one line made me pause and think: “The happiest moment of my life is still that split-second a year ago when, as I laid crushed under a 2000 pound car, I realized my husband and 9-year-old boy were out of the vehicle and absolutely OK.” Dire moments like this force us to acknowledge what’s truly important to us. In Hope’s case, it was her husband and son. And in the remainder of her email she talks about how her family spends significantly more time together now, sharing daily stories, telling little jokes, and appreciating each other’s company. “The accident made us realize how much time we had been wasting every day on things that weren’t important, which prevented us from spending quality time with each other,” she said. It’s hard to think about a story like Hope’s and not ask yourself: What do I need to stop wasting time on? Here are some things to consider that I’ve been examining in my own life: Yes, it’s your turn to treat your limited time today with extra care. Because there’s such a big difference between empty fatigue and gratifying exhaustion. And life is too short not to invest in meaningful activities… But before you go, please leave Angel and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this post.

"3 Reasons Most of Us Will Procrastinate Today Until it’s Too Late|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/procrastinate-too-late.jpg?resize=500%2C375&ssl=1| We waste our time waiting for the ideal path to appear. But it never does. Because we forget that paths are made by walking, not waiting. Twenty years ago he walked into my dorm room on the verge of tears. “I can’t take it anymore!” he groaned. “I’m just running in place. I aim. I sprint. And I fall every time. I’m getting nowhere! Nowhere!” His desperate eyes stared into mine, hoping and searching for an answer… He has dreamed of pursuing a career in software engineering since he was a kid. “Businesses worldwide will rely on my code someday,” he used to tell his computer programming teacher in high school. Now, as a junior enrolled in computer science at a reputable university, he finally has a clear shot at making his dream a reality. He wakes up every morning filled with excitement and positive intentions. Studying is actually the first thing that crosses his mind. “I’ve got to get that chapter read,” he tells himself. But first he needs to grab some Starbucks and a muffin. “Okay, now I’m ready.” He sits down at his desk and cracks open the “Agile Software Development” book for his class tomorrow. The phone rings. It’s Jen, a good friend he met in his sophomore English class. “Lunch today? Yeah, I could do that. How’s noon sound? Perfect. See you then.” Before he sits back down to read, he remembers that he skipped his workout yesterday. “A quick workout will only take forty-five minutes and it will energize my mind for a few hours of diligent studying,” he thinks to himself. He puts his sneakers on, grabs his earphones and heads over to the campus gym. When he returns from the gym, he takes a shower and is once again ready to read. “Chapter 1:  Welcome to the power of agile software development. This book is divided into…” “Ah, crap! I forgot to email my mom those photos I promised her. Heck, it will only take a second.” He quickly fires-up his laptop and opens his email application. But before he has time to send the email, he gets a text message from an old high school buddy, Danny, whom he hasn’t spoken to in six months. After a 45-minute texting session, he sends the email to his mom and returns to the book. He glances up at the wall clock and realizes he has to leave in 30 minutes to meet Jen for lunch. “Gosh, it’s pointless to get into the groove of a focused study session for just 30 measly minutes,” he says aloud. He convinces himself that it’s in his best interest to save the reading for after lunch. So he logs into an online discussion forum he participates in, replies to a few messages from his friends and then heads off to meet Jen. Once he returns from lunch an hour and a half later, he feels exhausted. The post-meal grogginess is kicking in hard. “All I need is another round of Starbucks and I’ll be ready.” He hustles out to grab it. As he sits down at his desk with a fresh cup of coffee he repeats the phrase “No more procrastinating!” over and over as a mantra in his mind. He cracks the book back open. “Chapter 1:  Welcome to the power of agile software development. This book is divided into…” But then his neighbor knocks on his door. “Turn on the Local 6 news channel! The college apartment complex down the street is on fire!” his neighbor chants. He thinks about it for a second, puts the book down and clicks on the television. “This should only take a second…” And another day comes closer to an end. She gets up early every morning, grabs her soccer ball, and heads outside before she even brushes her teeth, or washes her face, or eats. She juggles the ball between her feet nonstop until she achieves a continuous count of 50. An old high school coach once told her that Mia Hamm (the greatest female soccer player ever) used to do this. When she’s done, she cleans herself up for the day, grabs a glass of milk and some granola, and heads off to soccer practice. Sometimes she catches up with me after practice, just before our 9AM Economics class. I love it when she does, because her positive attitude is contagious. Her eyes always radiate with contentment and verve. In the few minutes before class we usually philosophize about our lives, our ambitions, and our relationships. For instance, recently she said, “It’s all about balance. We’ve got to somehow mesh our long-term ambitions with our momentary pleasures.” She always explains herself clearly until she’s confident that I understand her point of view. Once class starts, she’s silent, entirely focused on the professor’s lecture. Her notes are more diligent than most. And although she rarely raises her hand, when she does, her question or comment usually brings a respectful smile to the professor’s face. Outside of class, I seldom see her during the day. She locks herself away in her dorm room, or in the library, or on the soccer field, to focus on her priorities. She reads, writes, learns, and practices. She conditions her mind and her body with perpetual vigor. Once or twice a week, when she actually takes a break, she’ll call me at lunchtime. She usually goes off on a short tangent about something she’s recently learned or experienced that excites her. And she always finishes by saying, “I’ll fill you in on the details later.” Because she knows I’m interested in hearing them. Because she mindfully extracts interesting details from data sources — details that most of us miss. After a little nourishment, she gets back to work. Pages turn. Notes are taken. Keys on her laptop click repeatedly. And she carries forth until her vision blurs. When it does, she gets up, juggles her soccer ball to a count of 25, and refocuses herself on her work. Again she forges ahead for another couple of hours until her brain has trouble focusing again and her belly aches with hunger. Then she swings by my dorm room. It’s pretty late now, and both of us are done with whatever we’ve been working on. So we head out for a bite to eat. She fills me in on her day and speaks enthusiastically about the things that move her. Sometimes it’s something new she learned. Sometimes it’s an entrepreneurial idea. Sometimes it’s soccer. Or someone she met on campus. Or a song she heard that inspires her. When we finish eating, she walks back to her dorm room. She thinks, or reads an inspiring book, or listens to music, or strums her acoustic guitar, or works on the song she’s been leisurely writing for the past few weeks. When her eyes finally get heavy, she snuggles into her bed and falls blissfully asleep in an instant. Satisfied with today. Eager for tomorrow. When he walked into my dorm room on the verge of tears that day twenty years ago, I told him about her and how she lives her life. And although we don’t talk nearly as much as we used to, I received an email from him last night out of the blue. It was a cheerful email about the computer software company he started ten years ago. As it turns out, he just landed his first seven-figure contract. In the P.S. section of the email, he wrote: “Do you remember that story you told me back in our college days about the girl who played soccer and focused like a boss on her top priorities? Thank you. That advice saved my life.” We fill our calendars, our social media feeds, and our days with various forms of distraction and busyness, oftentimes just to avoid doing the little things that must be done — to avoid being slightly uncomfortable with the workload in front of us. The instant we feel a bit of discomfort, we run off in the direction of the nearest shiny object that catches our attention. And this habit gradually dismantles our best intentions and our true potential. Our dreams and priorities go by the wayside, and we’re left regretting another wasted day. Yes, most of us suffer from a severe misalignment of our priorities. In a recent survey we conducted with 750 of our Getting Back to Happy Course students, we asked them questions to determine how much joy they derived from their most common daily activities. As you might expect, the joy rating for work-related obligations typically fell below voluntary personal activities. But what surprised us is this: Most of the students surveyed said many of their voluntary personal activities did NOT give them joy and fulfillment. For example, several of them said they derived far more pleasure from time dedicated to family, practicing spirituality, or working on a passion project, than from time spent watching Netflix and browsing social media. And yet these same exact students admitted to spending more time watching Netflix and browsing social media than engaging in the activities they say give them more joy and fulfillment. If anything, our student survey shines light on a rather widespread misalignment between what we do and what we deem meaningful and enjoyable. And sadly, this misalignment ultimately leads us into bouts of senseless busyness and distraction peppered with lots of regret. Some might say our tendency to perpetually waste time reveals our true priorities — that we’d rather engage in mindless busyness, distraction, and entertainment over just about anything else. But that’s not true. What’s really happening is an error in our decision-making process. To avoid discomfort in the present, we have literally conditioned ourselves to subconsciously avoid the present moment. We think about the past and future far more than we think about today. We think about other people’s social lives instead of our own. We are physically in one place and mentally in another. Without conscious presence and focus, we mindlessly occupy the present moment with low-value activities that lack meaning and joy. And that’s why I want to remind you of some common reasons we procrastinate, and give you some keys to getting back on track with what matters most: There’s a BIG difference between being busy and being productive. Don’t confuse motion with progress. A rocking horse keeps moving but never makes any forward progress. Don’t be a rocking horse! At times, you have to say “no” to good things to be able to say “yes” to important things. You simply can’t do it all. So be mindful and choose wisely. Focus on your priorities. What you focus on grows stronger in your life. At every moment millions of little things compete for your attention. All these things fall into one of two categories: things that are top priorities and things that are not. You’ll never get more done by blindly working more hours on everything that comes up. Instead, you’ll get more done when you follow specific plans that measure and track top priorities and milestones. So if you want to be less busy and more successful, don’t ask how to make something more efficient until you’ve first asked, “Do I need to do this at all?” The bottom line is that feeling like you’re doing busywork is often the result of saying yes too often. We all have obligations, but a comfortable pace can only be found by properly managing your yeses. So stop saying “yes” when you need to say “no.” You can’t always be agreeable; that’s how people take advantage of you.  Sometimes you have to set clear boundaries. You might have to say no to certain favors, or work projects, or community activities, or committees, or volunteer groups, or coaching your kid’s sports team, or some other seemingly worthwhile activity. And I know what you’re thinking — it seems unfair to say no when these are very worthwhile things to do. It kills you to say no. But you must. Because the alternative is that you’re going to do a half-hearted, poor job at each one, be stressed beyond belief, and feel like you’re stuck in an endless cycle of failure and frustration. You won’t be getting enough sleep, your focus will get worse and worse due to exhaustion, and eventually you’ll reach a breaking point. When it’s all said and done, will you have said more than you’ve done? Let that question sink in, and then remind yourself that the last six letters in the word “attraction” are “action.” If you want to attract positive changes into your life, you have to act accordingly. If you have an idea about what you want the next chapter of your life to look like, you have to DO things that support this idea every day. An idea, after all, isn’t going to do anything for you until you do something productive with it. In fact, as long as that great idea is just sitting around in your head it’s doing far more harm than good. Your subconscious mind knows you’re procrastinating on something that’s important to you. The necessary work that you keep postponing causes stress, anxiety, fear, and usually more procrastination — a vicious cycle that continues to worsen until you interrupt it with ACTION. And remember, you can’t lift 1,000 pounds all at once, but you can easily lift one pound 1,000 times. In repetition, your little actions have great power.  You become highly skilled at whatever you do again and again.  Every day offers you the opportunity to develop a ritual of success, regardless of your priorities or how you personally define success.  So from this moment forward… May your actions speak louder than your words. May your life preach louder than your lips. May your success be your noise in the end. (Note: Angel and I build tiny, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals & Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy Course.) Think about the most common problems we deal with in our lives — from laziness to lack of exercise to unhealthy diets to procrastination, and so on. In most cases, problems like these are not caused not by a physical ailment, but by a weakness of the mind — a weakness that urges us to avoid discomfort. Most of us dream about the reward without the risk. The shine without the grind. But we can’t have a destination without a journey. And a journey always has costs. At the very least, you have to give up a little time and energy to take a step forward every day. So, instead of dreaming about what you want right now, first ask yourself: “What am I willing to give up to get it?” Or, for those inevitably hard days: “What is worth suffering for?” Seriously, think about it: If you want the six-pack abs, you have to want the sore muscles, the sweaty clothes, the mornings or afternoons at the gym, and the healthy meals. If you want the successful business, you have to also want the long days, the stressful business deals and decisions, and the possibility of failing twenty times to learn what you need to know to succeed in the long run. If you want something in life, you have to also want the costs of getting it. And you have to be willing to put in the effort and go all the way. Otherwise there’s no point in dreaming. This could mean losing stability and comfort for a while, and maybe even your mind on occasion. It could mean not eating what you want, or not sleeping in, for weeks on end. It could mean stretching your comfort zone super thin. It could mean sacrificing certain relationships and daring yourself to make new ones. It could mean spending time alone in solitude. Solitude, though, is a gift that makes great things possible — it gives you the space you need. Everything else is a test of your determination and how much you want it. And if you really want it, you’ll do it, despite discomfort and rejection and the odds. And every step will feel better than anything else you can imagine… You will realize that the struggle is not found on the path, it is the path, and it’s worth it! So again, if you really want it, go all the way. There’s no better feeling in the world — there’s no better feeling than knowing what it means to be ALIVE. (Angel and I discuss this further in the “Passion & Growth” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Angel and I are not immune to any of the points discussed above. None of us are above this stuff. Just like every other human being, sometimes we let procrastination and busyness get the best of us — we let distractions get in the way of our priorities. And it takes practice just to realize this, and then even more practice to get back on track. Over the past decade, Angel and I have gradually learned to pay more attention to the beauty and practicality of living a simpler life. A life uncluttered by most of the meaningless distractions people fill their lives with, leaving us with space for what’s truly meaningful. A life that isn’t constant rushing, worrying or stress, but instead contemplation, creation, and connection with the people and projects that matter most to us. By redefining our priorities, and building healthy rituals to back them up, we’ve literally been able to change our lives. And this is now a healthy practice we coach our course students though every single day as well. If you’ve been feeling overwhelmed and stressed out a lot lately, I challenge you to rethink how you’re spending your time, and replace the meaningless with the meaningful. All details aside, I hope you will do your best to make a meaningful day out of today, that you will dream courageously and live mindfully, that you will create something small that didn’t exist before you took action, that you will love and be loved in return, and that you will find the strength to accept and grow from the challenges you can’t change. And, most importantly (because I think there should be more kindness and wisdom in this world), that you will, when you must, be wise with your priorities, and that you will always be extra kind to yourself and others. If you’re feeling up to it, Angel and I would love to hear from YOU. Which point mentioned above resonates with you the most today, and why? Please leave us a comment below and share your thoughts.

Most people do. She’s the kind of person who listens when you talk, who smiles often, and who says things that make the people around her smile. She’s incredibly intelligent, but in a way that makes others feel comfortable. It’s the way she expresses herself in simple terms you can understand — almost like she’s articulating the thoughts you already have in your head, but haven’t quite found the right words to say aloud. And it doesn’t matter who you are either. Michelle always has a way of relating to you. Because, in a way, she’s been there with you all along. She can think like you, so she understands you. It’s truly a special gift. So many of us have limitations in our perceptions. We understand the soldiers but not the politics governing the wars. We understand the people who go to the movies but not the ones who attend to sensationalism and tabloid news. But somehow Michelle gets all of us. Again, it’s her gift. If she hasn’t actually experienced what you’re talking about, she’ll be honest about it, but she’ll also make you feel acknowledged and heard. And once you return home after spending a night with Michelle, you’ll catch yourself smiling and thinking about how there needs to be more people like her in the world. Because if there were, there would be far less to worry about. Michelle passed away today. I don’t really want to discuss the details right now, because honestly, they aren’t relevant. It could have been a car accident. It could have been old age. We are often far too concerned with how people died, rather than how they lived. And I want you to know how Michelle lived. She told stories — lots of stories that contained beautiful, subtle insights and wisdom about our lives and the world around us. And today, I want to share with you the last story she told me before she died: One Sunday morning when I was a little girl, my father surprised me and took me to the fishing docks. But instead of fishing, like all the other little girls and boys were doing with their parents, we sat down on the end of one of the docks and watched all the other children fish. For over an hour, we sat there and watched until we left without ever casting a single fishing line into the water. I was simultaneously sad and angry. On the drive home I told my father that I’d never forgive him for being so mean to me. He looked at me, smiled and said, “I love you, Michelle.” When I didn’t respond, he asked, “Did you notice how happy all the other little girls and boys were? Did you see their smiles? Could you feel the happiness in their hearts?” After a moment of silence I quickly snapped, “I don’t really care! I just want to go fishing like everyone else!” My father took a deep breath and kept driving. We went back to the fishing docks dozens of Sunday mornings throughout my childhood. And each time we saw dozens of other little girls and boys jumping and laughing and celebrating as they reeled in fish. But we still never cast a single fishing line into the water. We just sat there on the end of that same dock and watched. And my father never explained why. But he didn’t need to. Because years later, after I entered adulthood, and found myself volunteering at a local homeless shelter, I suddenly realized that those mornings spent sitting on that dock was where I learned how to love. Michelle’s last story continues to make me think… Too often we pass people in a hurry, without caring or thinking twice. Or we judge those who aren’t moving at our pace. And rarely do we ever stop. Just to witness. Or to listen. Or to love. Because we forget, or perhaps never learned, that every passing face represents a story just as captivating, complicated and worthy as our own. Everyone has gone through something that has inadvertently changed them and forced them to struggle, adapt and grow. Everyone’s smile has been earned. Everyone we meet has fought hard, and continues to fight in some way. And to them, it’s equally as significant,worthwhile, and difficult as whatever we’re going through. The happiness that is occasionally on display around us is truly an experience to marvel at and admire. And although it’s not always easy to do so, when we take time to truly witness and listen, instead of bypassing or judging too quickly, we can learn so much… about ourselves, about each other, and about love in general. Since Marc and I intellectually understand that we shouldn’t bypass or judge people too quickly, but sometimes still forget when we’re in the heat of a difficult or pressing moment, we’ve implemented a simple strategy that continuously reminds us NOT to bypass or judge. Whenever we’re heading into a busy day in which we’ll likely be surrounded by others, we read a couple of the mantras listed below (reminders and quotes compiled from our books and our blog’s email archive) before we leave the house in the morning. Doing this consistently over the years has gradually changed how we see and treat people from the get-go each day. We still have to practice, of course, but we are far more patient and loving with people than we used to be. To help you practice, I recommend storing or bookmarking this article in your smart phone or tablet, and then reading (and re-reading) the following notes to yourself at least a couple times a week. Some of the morning notes above (like numbers 14 through 19 for example) potentially require a willingness to cordially deal with people who yell at us, interrupt us, cut us off in traffic, talk about distasteful things, and so forth. And although Marc and I recently covered this in a previous article on not taking things personally, I figured with was worth partially reiterating here: Some people will violate the way we think people should behave. And sometimes their behavior deeply offends us. But if we let these people get to us, again and again, we will be upset and offended far too often. So, what can we do? There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution, but here are two strategies Marc and I often recommend to our course students and our coaching clients: Try one of these strategies the next time someone offends you. And then smile in serenity, armed with the comforting knowledge that there’s no reason to let someone else’s behavior turn you into someone you aren’t. (Note: Marc and I build “smarter communication” strategies and habits with our students in the “Love and Relationships” module of Getting Back to Happy Course.) Yes, it’s your turn… To instill more love into this world, even when it’s difficult. To love what you do, until you can do what you love. To love where you are, until you can be where you love. And, above all, to love the people you are with, until you can be with the people you love most. Fewer judgments. Less bypassing and ignoring. More love. Ultimately, this is the way we find happiness, opportunity, and peace. Let’s practice today, together. 🙂 … Please share this post with others who you think may benefit from it, and also share your thoughts with us in the comments area below. If you’re up to it, I’d love it if you shared an additional quote or personal saying that reminds you to treat others with less judgement and more love (for both their sake and yours).

And although she had spent decades enthusiastically dreaming about traveling and seeing the world, she had never taken a single step to make this dream a reality. Finally, she woke up on the morning of her 65th birthday and decided that now was the time! She sold all of her possessions except for some essential items she needed, packed these items into a backpack, and began her journey out into the world. The first several days on the road were amazing and filled with awe — with every step forward she felt like she was finally living the life she had dreamed. But a few short weeks later, the days on the road started taking a toll on her. She felt misplaced and she missed the familiar comforts of her old life. As her feet and legs grew more and more sore with each new step, her mood also took a turn for the worse. Eventually she stopped walking, took off her backpack, slammed it on the ground, and sat down beside it as tears began streaming down her cheeks. She stared hopelessly down a long winding road that once led to an amazing world, but now seemed to lead only to discomfort and unhappiness. “I have nothing! I have nothing left in my life!” she shouted out loud at the top of her lungs. Coincidentally, a renowned guru and life adviser from a nearby village was resting quietly behind a pine tree adjacent to where the woman was sitting. When the woman began shouting, the guru heard every word and he felt it was his duty to help her. Without thinking twice, he jumped out from behind the pine tree, grabbed her backpack, and ran into the forest that lined both sides of the road. Stunned and in complete disbelief, the woman started crying even harder than before, to the point of near breathlessness. “That backpack was all I had,” she cried.” And now it’s gone! Now everything is gone in my life!” After roughly ten minutes of much-needed tears, the woman gradually collected her emotions, stood up again and began staggering slowly down the road. Meanwhile the guru cut through the forest and secretly placed the backpack in the middle of the road just a short distance ahead of the woman. When the woman’s teary eyes fell upon the backpack, she almost couldn’t believe what she was seeing — everything she thought she had just lost was once again right in front of her. She couldn’t help but smile from ear to ear. “Oh, thank heavens!” the woman exclaimed. “I am so grateful! Now I definitely have what I need to continue onward…” As we journey through our personal and professional lives, there will inevitably be periods of incredible frustration and despair. During those tough times, it will sometimes appear to us that we’ve lost everything, and that nothing and nobody could possibly motivate us to move onward in the direction of our dreams. But just like the woman who stumbled across the guru, we are all holding with us a backpack of support that comes in many forms — it can be a simple email or text message from someone we respect, inspiring blog posts, insightful books, helpful neighbors, supportive communities, and so much more. When the going gets tough — when we feel like we’ve completely lost our motivation — we need to remember… If you are struggling right now, you’ve got this! No matter your circumstances, you always have what you need to take the next smallest step. Or as Epicurus so profoundly said, “Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.” Be mindful. Be present. Keep going… One day at a time, one small step at a time. (Note: Angel and I build small, life-changing daily steps/habits with our students in the “Goals & Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy Course.) Please leave a comment below and let us know: What’s one source of hope, motivation, or gratitude you sometimes turn to when you need it most? Anything else to share about this article?

One Lesson Too Many People Learn Too Late in Life (Stop Waiting!)|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/stop-waiting-one-lesson.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| “In elementary school my parents told me it didn’t matter what I did when I grew up, so long as it made me happy. ‘Happiness is the whole point of life,’ my father said. ‘But it doesn’t always come easy. Your mother loves to help people in need, so she became a psychiatric nurse. I love reading, writing and poetry, so I became an English teacher. We both find happiness in the hard work we do each day.’ A few years later when I was in junior high, my sixth-grade homeroom teacher put me in detention for ‘being difficult.’ She went around the classroom and asked each student what they wanted to be when they grew up. When she got to me, I told her I wanted to be happy. She told me I was missing the whole point of the question. I told her she was missing the whole point of life.” That’s an old parable my grandma recited to me countless times when I was a kid. I’ve since seen a shortened version of it circulate on social media, oftentimes being falsely attributed to John Lennon, Goldie Hawn, and others. While the internet sleuths seem conflicted over who penned the very first version of the parable, it’s a story that has always stuck with me. Sure it oversimplifies the complexities of happiness, but it makes some good points too. And my grandma’s version has that line about “finding happiness in hard work,” which is a concept that still resonates deeply with me today. As adults, Angel and I have spent nearly two decades working one-on-one with hundreds of course students, book readers, and live event attendees who struggle with variations of that very concept — finding happiness when life demands that we work hard for it. So many of us attach to the expectation that life should be easier than it is. Regardless of what we choose to do “when we grow up,” we subconsciously fantasize that our chosen path will have very few detours, interruptions, and inconveniences. And then we wait around endlessly for things to get easier, as countless good opportunities pass us by. Whenever you catch yourself stuck in this kind of unproductive cycle, remind yourself that… Yes, you need to do the things most people would rather avoid — the things that make you uncomfortable, that are far easier to run from, that others can’t possibly do for you… the things that make you stronger but also make you question how you’re going to find the strength to push forward. Why? Because those hard things ultimately build you up and change your life. They make the difference between existing and living, between knowing the path and walking it, between a lifetime of empty promises to yourself and one filled with purpose, progress, and fulfillment. The key? Consistent and passionate daily action! Learn to believe in your heart that you’re meant to live each day full of passion and purpose — that each and every moment is worthy in its own way. And remind yourself that passion is not something you find in life; it’s something you do. When you want to find the passion and inner strength needed to change your situation, you have to push yourself to step forward. Many of us are still hopelessly trying to “find our passion” — something that we believe will lead us closer to happiness, success, or the life situation we ultimately want. And I say “hopelessly” primarily because passion can’t really be found. When we say we’re trying to find our passion, it implies that our passion is somehow hiding behind a tree or under a rock somewhere. But that’s far from the truth. The truth is, our passion comes from doing things right. If you’re waiting to somehow “find your passion” somewhere outside yourself, so you finally have a reason to put your whole heart and soul into your life and the changes you need to make, you’ll likely be waiting around for an eternity. On the other hand, if you’re tired of waiting, and you’d rather live more passionately starting today and experience small positive changes, it’s time to proactively inject passion into the very next thing you do. Think about it: Like most of us, you’re likely putting a halfhearted effort into most of the things you do on a daily basis. Because you’re still waiting. You’re still waiting to “find” something to be passionate about — some magical reason to step into the life you want to create for yourself. But you need to do the exact opposite! Going back to when I was a kid again, my grandmother used to tell me, “Stop waiting for better opportunities. The one you have in front of you is the best opportunity.” She also said, “Too often we spend too much time making it perfect in our heads before we ever even do it. Stop waiting for perfection and just do your best with what you have today, and then improve it tomorrow.” Believe it or not, recent psychological research indirectly reinforces my grandmother’s sentiments. For many years, psychologists believed our minds could directly affect our physical state of being, but never the other way around. Nowadays, however, it is widely documented that our bodies — for example, our momentary facial expressions and body posture — can directly affect our mental state of being too. So while it’s true that we change from the inside out, we also change from the outside in.  And you can make this reality work for you. If you want more passion and happiness in your life right now, act accordingly right now. Put your heart and soul into something! Not into tomorrow’s opportunities, but into the opportunity right in front of you. Not into tomorrow’s tasks, but into today’s tasks. Not into tomorrow’s run, but into today’s run. Not into tomorrow’s relationships, but into today’s relationships. Angel and I are certain you have plenty in your life right now that’s worth your time and energy. You have people and circumstances in your life that need you as much as you need them. You have a massive reservoir of potential passion within you, just waiting. Stop waiting! Remember, new paths are made by walking, not waiting. And no, you shouldn’t feel any more confident before you take the next step. Taking the next step is what gradually builds your confidence. Truth be told, if you wait for “the right time” — if you wait until you feel 100% ready — you will be waiting the rest of your life. Take this to heart right now. Too many people wait too long to live their best lives. They wait all day for 5pm, all week for Friday, all year for the holidays, all their lives for passion and happiness. Don’t be one of them! You don’t need to have it all figured out to take the next step. But you do need to take the next step to figure it out. And as you struggle forward, remember, it is far better to be exhausted from taking small steps forward, than it is to be tired of waiting around doing absolutely nothing. Just put your heart and soul into what you’ve got right in front of you today… And if you’re feeling up to sharing, Angel and I would love know: Please leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

Use your frustrations to motivate you rather than annoy you. You are in control of your focus and how you choose to allocate your energy today. The renowned psychologist Carl Rogers noted that people are often unhappy because of a lack of congruence in their lives, which is another way of saying that complexity blinds us to life’s simple and obvious solutions. For Rogers, simply sitting with a patient and having them talk through their problems, without the therapist leading them or making judgments or giving advice, was the best way for them to let go of their problems. Rogers determined that when you give a person a safe and supportive space to think through things, they tend to do so more effectively. Right now, I want to give you a safe and supportive space to think, so you can let go of any extra baggage that’s been weighing you down. Try this: pause for a second to notice what’s going on in your body. Are your jaw muscles clenched? Are your shoulders or neck tightened? Do you notice a part of your body holding on to tension — perhaps tension fueled by something you’re worried about? Most of us are holding tension in our bodies and stress in our minds, whether we realize it or not. Why are we doing this to ourselves? Why do we get tense, stressed, anxiety-ridden, and feel generally overwhelmed by life? It’s because life isn’t the flawless, calm, controllable experience we’d like it to be. We want things to be easy, comfortable, and picture-perfect. Unfortunately reality is often the opposite. Bad things happen. Work is stressful. People let us down. We make mistakes and let ourselves down. We aren’t as proficient and disciplined as we’d hope to be. And life continues to frustrate us because there’s just so much to do and learn and process. The problem isn’t life, or other people, or even ourselves. The problem is our propensity to hold on to what we want everything and everyone to be, in order for life to be good enough for us. Our attachments to our ideals accelerates tension in our bodies and stress in our lives And our reluctance to let go and accept things as they are is the root of our problems. Of course, we don’t want to feel this way, so we try to avoid what we’re going through. We distract ourselves with alcohol or YouTube or social media or whatever, which only makes matters worse. Marc and I have a ton of firsthand experience in this arena. A decade ago when we were coping with the back-to-back loss of my brother, Todd, and our mutual best friend, Josh, to illness and death, the amount of tension and stress in our lives was overwhelming. We literally resisted reality in every imaginable way, every step of the way, for a long time. And although most people would say we were justified in our grief-stricken actions, we were undoubtedly holding on too tightly to our ideals, which stalled our ability to heal and grow. Again, we all do this to ourselves sometimes, even when life is going generally well. So if you think you might be holding on too tightly in some area of your life right now, here are some general signs it’s time for you to start letting go: To a great extent, life is really like that old joke: Patient: Doctor it hurts whenever I do this. Doctor: Then stop doing that. And sometimes we are blessed, in a bittersweet way, with an event that shakes the foundation of our lives and makes us realize “I have to stop doing that.” As I mentioned in the intro, Marc and I have been there. One of the key things we learned from personal experience, and also from coaching hundreds of students and live event attendees over the years, is that the vast majority of pain and sadness in our daily lives comes from our propensity to hold on… to just about everything. When you develop the skill of letting go, and practice it daily, you automatically prepare yourself for any challenge that could possibly come your way. For example, if a small unexpected change arises in your life, it’s only a “bad” thing if you’re holding on tightly to the way you wish life could be — all the expectations and ideals you have. But if you let go of that wish (and those expectations and ideals), the change isn’t bad. It just makes life different than you expected, and it could be a good thing in the long run if you embrace it and see the opportunities it provides. Ultimately, we need to practice shifting our perspective so we can let go when we must. And we need to keep in mind that letting go isn’t about having the ability and courage to release every past experience — it’s about having the wisdom and strength to embrace the present as it is. It’s not about forgetting — it’s about remembering without fear… It’s stepping forward, untethered, with a present mind and a lesson learned. I challenge you to leverage the reminders — the signs — above to do just that. (Note: We take a deeper dive into the process of letting go in our New York Times bestselling book, Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs.)

"One Surprisingly Small Step that Will Change Your Whole Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/1-tiny-yet-hard-step.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| Too often people overestimate the significance of one big defining moment and underestimate the value of making good decisions and small steps of progress on a daily basis. You’re probably familiar with what’s known as the Serenity Prayer. It goes like this: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. There’s an important lesson here — one that’s very often glossed over… When a chaotic reality is swirling around us, we often try to relieve our anxiety by exerting our will over external things we cannot control. It helps us stave off one of the most dreaded feelings: complete powerlessness. With that in mind, I have good news and bad news. The bad news is that generally speaking, almost everything is outside your control. What other people do, whether it will rain tomorrow, whether or not your efforts will be appreciated — all of these outcomes depend on factors that aren’t YOU. But that’s also the good news. The friction and frustration created by trying to change things you cannot change is the crucible where a ton of unhappiness is born. Accepting that most things are outside your influence gives you explicit permission to let them unfold as they may. Stoic philosopher Epictetus put it this way: “Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our actions.” Overcoming the “three big un’s” that so many of us struggle with daily — unhappiness, unconvinced things will ever change, unsure what to do next — begins with understanding what you can control and what you cannot. The mental shift here is not easy. Most of us have spent a lifetime worrying about things that we can’t control. Society practically encourages this. For most, it’s a bona fide habit — one that should be replaced with a healthy understanding of how much we can actually change. Again though, it’s hard to get your mind wrapped around all this when you’re constantly hearing… “Why don’t you just get over it?” or “Just let it go.” We’ve all heard some flavor of this advice before. And it passes the sniff test, to a certain extent. I mean, “time heals all wounds,” right? Well, yes… sort of. But wounds heal differently depending on how they’re treated. Left alone, a gash in your skin will leave a large scar and be vulnerable to injury again in the future. This is why we get stitches — it helps the wound heal in a way that limits the chance of re-injury down the road. Emotional wounds work the same way. Given enough time, most emotional pain will diminish — that’s true. But… In the emotional sense, scars equal baggage — baggage we carry with us into every aspect of our lives. These scars grow and accumulate until one day you wake up suffering from one or more of the “three un’s” (unhappiness, unconvinced things will ever change, unsure what to do next). So, don’t get over it. Go through it, one step at a time. Honestly, I understand the desire to “get over” difficult experiences or situations rather than facing them. Revisiting painful memories or facing our present demons is really, really hard. And we as human beings are hard-wired to not cause ourselves pain. However, as our parents taught us, ignoring a problem doesn’t make it go away. And in addition to the scars, to ignore or downplay a wound puts you at risk for infection, emotionally as well as physically. Unresolved issues in your life take up residence in your mind and influence your decisions, your relationships, and your attitudes. They rob you of your happiness and potential. Of course, doing the hard yet necessary things to resolve your issues and heal your wounds can feel impossible. This is how Angel and I felt a decade ago when we were knocked down and stuck in a rut after simultaneously losing two loved ones — including Angel’s dear brother — to suicide and illness. It was nearly impossible to move anywhere significant when we didn’t feel we had the strength to push forward. So if you’re feeling this way now — like it’s impossible to make significant progress today — you aren’t wrong for feeling what you feel. In many cases, you’re right: significant progress comes gradually with time and consistency. It’s all about taking one tiny positive step at a time, and staying the course. Consider the following section, which is an excerpt from our upcoming guided journal, “The Good Morning Journal”: Think about the fact that it only takes a one degree change in temperature to convert water to vapor, or ice to water. It’s such a tiny change — just one step in a different direction — and yet the results are dramatic. A tiny change can make all the difference in the world. Now, consider another example where a tiny change is compounded by time and distance. Perhaps you’re trying to travel somewhere specific, but you’re off course by just one tiny degree in the wrong direction… You get the idea — over time and distance, a mere one-degree change in course makes a significant difference…  This same philosophy holds true in various aspects of our lives. The tiniest things we do each day — positive and negative alike — can make all the difference. They either bring us closer or farther away from where we ultimately want to be. And yet, we mostly ignore this reality. We default to behaving as if our daily actions won’t ever be significant enough. Or, again, we try to exert control over the bigger things we have no control over. Think about it… Don’t be one of them anymore! Truth be told, everyone travels 24 hours a day, whether they’re moving in the right direction or not. How much richer would your life be if you committed yourself to making just one degree of effort toward improving something about your situation each day? And even though it will surely be harder than doing nothing, it doesn’t even have to be anything that hard. You just need to muster up the courage to break free from the status quo and take one small step forward today, and then do it again tomorrow. Pick something tiny and productive to improve upon, and then make it a daily habit. Doing so will make all the difference in the world — it could literally change your life — just a few short weeks down the road. (Note: Angel and I build tiny, life-changing daily habits like this with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy Course, and again, we also establish a foundational habit of consistency through daily journaling in our newest publication through Penguin Random House, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts & Reflections to Start Every Day”.) Yes, it’s your turn to focus on those surprisingly small yet life-changing steps today. So give yourself some credit right now for how far you’ve come in recent times, and then take another step forward today!

An Open Letter to Those Who Don’t Feel “Good Enough” Right Now|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/open-letter-not-good-enough2.jpg?resize=500%2C382&ssl=1| 10 Hard Things You Shouldn’t Be Afraid to Do for Yourself|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/these-10-hard-things.jpg?resize=500%2C326&ssl=1| “You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.”— Mae West This morning a close neighborhood friend, Alison, passed away far too early. While Marc and I have spent most of the day grieving, I’ve also spent this past hour thinking about the fact that our lives are often much shorter than we expect, and that we need to do some pretty darn hard things to maximize our very limited time. Alison strongly believed in doing the hard yet necessary things in life — we talked about this topic on several occasions, and she never backed down from a challenge. So today, I want to reflect on this with you. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: you absolutely need to do hard things to be happy in the long run. Because the hard things ultimately build you up and change your life. They make the difference between existing and living, between knowing the path and walking it, between a lifetime of empty promises and one filled with more possibility and progress. You know this is true, so… You’re not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or a week ago. You’re always growing. Experiences don’t stop. That’s life. Sometimes there are things in our lives that aren’t meant to stay. Sometimes the changes we don’t want are the changes we need to grow. Let this sink in. Growth and change may be painful sometimes, but nothing in life is as painful as staying stuck where you don’t belong. The bottom line is that you can’t reach for anything new if you’re holding on to yesterday. You may think holding on makes you strong, but oftentimes it’s letting go and starting anew that truly builds your inner strength. You may not be where you want to be yet, but you’ve also come a long way from where you once were. Appreciate how far you’ve come. You’ve been through a lot, but you’ve grown a lot too.  Give yourself credit for your strength and resilience. You have good reason to believe that you can trust yourself going forward, not because you’ve always made the right choices, but because you’ve survived and grown from the bad ones. Good things take time, and you’re getting there. So don’t allow yourself to be crippled by stress and self-loathing. Everything is only as it is. There’s no reason to let it cripple you. Remind yourself to breathe — to let every moment be what it’s going to be. What’s meant to be will come your way, and what’s not will fall away. And remember that life’s best gifts may not always be wrapped the way you expect. (Read The Last Lecture.) Tell yourself, “I am ENOUGH” anytime you begin to feel otherwise. Accept your flaws. Admit your mistakes. Don’t hide and don’t lie. Deal with the truth — your truth — every step of the way. Learn the lessons, endure the consequences of reality, and move forward. Your truth won’t penalize you. Your mistakes won’t hurt you. Only your denial and cover-up will. Flawed and vulnerable people are powerful and strong in the long run. Liars and phonies are not. Every beautiful human being is made entirely of flaws, stitched together with good intentions and finished with trials and errors. So keep reminding yourself that you are YOU for a reason, and that the journey is worth it. Ignore the distractions. Listen to your own inner voice. Mind your own business. Keep your best wishes and your biggest desires close to your heart, and dedicate time to them every day. Don’t be scared to walk alone sometimes, and don’t be scared to enjoy it. And don’t let anyone’s ignorance, drama or negativity derail you. If your life is going to mean anything, you have to live it yourself. You have to choose the path that feels right to YOU, not the one that simply looks right to everyone else. It’s always better to be at the bottom of the ladder you want to climb, than the top of the one you don’t. So don’t wait until you’re halfway up the wrong ladder to listen to your intuition. Every morning, ask yourself what is truly important, and then find the courage, wisdom and willpower to build your day around your answer. In the end, it’s not what you say, but how you spend your time that counts. If you want to do something, you’ll find a way… if you don’t, you’ll find an excuse. (Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the Rituals chapter of our New York Times bestseller, Getting Back to Happy, and we also establish a foundational routine of consistency through daily journaling in our newest publication through Penguin Random House, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts & Reflections to Start Every Day”.) In a world with so much noise and clutter, you must make room for what matters. That means pruning nonessential commitments and eliminating as many distractions as you possibly can. No wasted time, no fluff, no regrets. The mark of a successful and peaceful person is the ability to set aside the “somewhat important” things in order to accomplish the vital ones first. When you’re crystal clear about your priorities, you can painlessly arrange them in the right order and discard the activities and commitments that do not support the ones at the top of your list. If you think and you think and you think, you will think yourself right out of happiness a thousand times over, and never once into it. Worrying doesn’t take away tomorrow’s troubles, it takes away today’s peace and potential. Stop over-thinking everything. Life is just too short. Your biggest limitations are the ones you make up in your mind. The biggest causes of your unhappiness are the false beliefs you refuse to let go of. You are capable of far more than you are often thinking, imagining, doing or being. But in time you will gradually become what you habitually contemplate, so clear your mind and let your hopes, not your fears, shape your future. How? Meditate. Run. Breathe. Write in your journal. Find the space… to set your mind free. Not everyone will appreciate what you do for them. You have to figure out who’s worth your attention and who’s just taking advantage of you. If your time and energy is misspent on the wrong relationships, or on too many activities that force you to neglect your good relationships, you can end up in a tedious cycle of fleeting friendships, superficial romances that are as thrilling as they are meaningless, and a general sense of wondering why you always seem to be chasing affection. Choose yourself rather than settle for those who treat you as ordinary. YOU certainly aren’t. Never settle for being someone’s option when you have the potential to be someone’s priority. You are the sum of the people you spend the most time with.  If you hang with the wrong people too often, they will bring you down. But if you hang with the right people, they will help you grow into your best self. These people will love all the things about you that others are intimidated by. As Mahatma Gandhi once said, “Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.” Life is a book and those who do not educate themselves read only a few pages. When you know better, you live better. Period. And remember that all education is self-education. It doesn’t matter if you’re sitting in a college classroom or a coffee shop. We don’t learn anything we don’t want to learn. Those of us who take the time and initiative to pursue knowledge on their own time are the only ones who earn a real education in this world. Take a look at any widely acclaimed scholar, entrepreneur or historical figure you can think of. Formal education or not, you’ll find that he or she is a product of continuous self-education. There are thousands of people who live their entire lives on the default settings, never realizing they can customize everything. Don’t settle for the default settings in life. Don’t hide behind indecision or laziness. Find your loves, talents, and passions, and embrace them fully! Seriously, too many people dream only at night in the quiet of their own minds, and then awake to find it was all an illusion. Don’t be one of them. Dream by day, too. Be one of the people who dream with their eyes wide open, and who works to make some of them come true. And forget popularity too. Just do your thing with passion, humility, and honesty. Do what you do, not for an applause, but because it’s what’s right. Pursue it a little bit each day, no matter what anyone else thinks. That’s how dreams are achieved. (Read Tuesdays with Morrie.) The greatest and most gratifying experiences in life cannot be seen or touched. They must be felt with the heart from the inside out. There’s nothing more inspiring than the complexity and beauty of human, heartfelt feelings. Sadly though, many people let the fear of judgment numb and silence them. Their deepest thoughts and feelings often go unspoken, and thus barely understood. Do NOT let people invalidate or minimize how you feel. If you feel something, you feel it and it’s real to you. Nothing anyone says has the power to invalidate that, ever. No one else occupies your body, or sees life through your eyes. No one else has lived through your exact experiences. And so, no one else has the right to dictate or judge how you feel. Your feelings are important. Never let anyone or any circumstance lead you to believe otherwise. Remind yourself that there is a great freedom in leaving others to their opinions, and there is a huge weight lifted when you take nothing personally. With Alison in mind, I sincerely hope this short post has inspired you to LIVE your life TODAY… Don’t ignore death (or any form of pain), but don’t be afraid of it either. Be afraid of a life you never lived because you were too afraid to take action on what matters most. Truth be told, death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside you while you’re still alive and breathing. Alison absolutely lived her life far beyond her years. Challenge yourself to do the same. Be bold. Be courageous. Be scared to death, and then take the next step anyway. Do the hard things you know you need to for yourself! Every. Single. Day.

But even if you aren’t, the core principle of this article remains relevant: As you age, you will learn to value your time, genuine relationships, meaningful work, and peace of mind, much more. Little else will matter. Deep down you know this already though, right? Yet today, just like the majority of us, you are distracted by almost everything else. You give too much of your time to meaningless time-wasters. You take your important relationships for granted. You get to work skeptically with inner resistance. And you let needless stress get the best of you. Why? Because you’re human, and human beings are imperfect creatures that make daily misjudgments. We get overwhelmed and caught up in our own heads, and sometimes we don’t know our lives to be any better than the few things that aren’t going our way. We literally scrutinize and dramatize the insignificant annoyances in our lives until we’re blue in the face, and then we sit back and scratch our heads in bewilderment of how unfulfilling life feels. And as our (subconscious) minds continue to dwell on these things, we try to distract ourselves to numb the tension we feel. By doing so, though, we also distract ourselves from what matters most. But the older we grow, the calmer and more focused we tend to become, and the less pointless drama, distraction, and senseless busyness we tend to engage in. Life humbles us gradually as we age. We begin to realize just how much nonsense we’ve wasted time on. And we begin to refocus our attention on what truly matters. Philosophically speaking, the afternoon and evening always understand what the morning never even suspected. But — and this is a big “but” — the steps taken in the morning do have a significant effect on the afternoon and evening. So with that philosophy in mind, challenge yourself to implement the right daily steps — the right daily rituals — starting today, and let the positive effects of doing so gradually compound in value until you reach your sunset years. Here are four such rituals Angel and I often recommend and implement with our course students and coaching clients: As time passes, you naturally have more of it behind you and less of it in front of you. The distant future, then, gradually has less value to you personally. And this is a key reality to keep in mind — the future matters less than the present. A good life always begins right now, when you stop waiting for a better one. Yet so many people wait all day for 5pm, all week for Friday, all year for the holidays, all their lives for happiness. But you don’t have to be one of them. Don’t wait until your life is almost over to realize how good it has been! Over the past decade, Angel and I have gradually learned to pay more attention to the beauty and practicality of living a simpler life. A life uncluttered by most of the meaningless drama, distraction, and busyness people fill their lives with, leaving us with space for what’s truly meaningful. A life that isn’t constant rushing, worrying and stress, but instead contemplation, creation, and connection with the people and projects that matter most to us. By redefining our priorities, and building healthy rituals to back them up, we’ve literally been able to change our lives. And again, this is now a healthy practice we coach our course students though every single day as well. If you’ve been feeling overwhelmed and stressed out a lot lately, I highly recommend you rethink how you’re spending your time, and replace the meaningless with the meaningful. Start by being honest about the distraction and busyness in your life… The biggest cost of filling your life with needless distraction and busyness (assuming you don’t crash from the texting and driving), is a gradual, long-term decline of your effectiveness and happiness. When you get in the habit of persistently dividing your attention, you’re partially engaged in every activity, but rarely focused on any one. And this dizzying lack of focus eventually trips you up and brings you down. The solution? More presence and focus on what matters most — and getting rid of the excess. The efficiency of your time relies heavily on the elimination of non-essentials, so you can focus exclusively on the one thing — and only one thing — that actually matters in each moment. And while plenty of full-length books have been written on this topic, let me give you the very basics of what Angel and I have been practicing: The bottom line here is that too often our minds are set on getting somewhere else. Too often another beautiful day comes to an end with hundreds of unnoticed moments behind us — we didn’t notice them because they were insignificant to us. And over time our entire lives become a massive pile of unnoticed and insignificant moments on our way to more important things. Then the important things get rushed through too… to get to the next one, and the next, until our time is up and we’re left questioning where it all went. But it doesn’t have to be this way anymore. This moment is your life, and you can make the best of it. The underlying key is to realize that you are not on your way somewhere else. Right now is not just a stepping-stone to another place — it is the ultimate destination, and you are already here! It’s nice to have acquaintances. It’s important to be friendly. But don’t get carried away and spread yourself too thin. Leave plenty of time for those who matter most to you. Your time is extremely limited, and sooner or later you just want to be around the few people who make you smile for all the right reasons. Truly, we all long for genuine relationships, but these relationships can be hard to find and nurture even in our overly connected lives. We meet people in person and socialize online, but these connections often lack a necessary dose of intimacy. We work alongside others in office buildings or co-working spaces, but our communication with them is usually work-oriented and not relationship-oriented. We may be lucky enough to have close friends and family in our lives, but when we are distracted by social media and busy with work, those relationships take a hit. So what can be done? A whole lot. But let’s quickly hit on the fundamentals: The healthiest and most genuine relationships are comprised of two people who are intimately familiar with each other’s evolving stories. These people make plenty of emotional room for their relationship, which means they sincerely listen to each other, they remember the major events each other have been through, and they keep up-to-date as the facts and feelings of each other’s reality evolves and changes. The key thing to remember is that nothing you can give is more appreciated than your sincere, focused attention — your full presence. Truly being with someone, and listening without a clock and without anticipation of the next event, is the ultimate compliment. It is indeed one of the most valued gestures you can make to them, and it arms you with the information you need to truly know them and support them in the long run. It’s also important to note that if two people care about each other and want to maintain a healthy relationship, they absolutely need to be “allowed” to openly communicate ALL of their feelings to each other — their true feelings — not just the agreeable and positive ones. If this is not “allowed” or supported by one or both people involved in the relationship — if one or both people fear punishment for their honesty — lies will gradually replace love, which ultimately leads to emotional disconnection. So with all the aforementioned said, one of the easiest ways to find more meaningful moments of presence with the people who matter to you, is to work together on something. If you have someone in mind whom you’d like to strengthen your relationship with, find a way to work hand in hand on a project that intrigues both of you. You could plant a communal garden together, or meet once a week to jointly work on an ongoing passion project — such as painting a mural, stitching quilts, or maybe even running a side business. Also, attending a life-enhancing conference together (live or virtual), and then mindfully examining and discussing it, is another related opportunity for working hand in hand on something meaningful. Passion is powerful! Your inner passion will likely become a key source of your greatest achievements and your finest moments. The fevering excitement of love. The joy of getting in flow. The clarity of a purpose. The ecstasy of letting go and being one with the present moment. In a nutshell, this is what passion gradually does for you. Without it there is little peace of mind in the end — just a hollow existence of unfulfilled promises — a lifetime left mostly unlived. That might sound a bit melodramatic, but it’s the truth… If your life is going to mean anything to you 10 years down the road, you have to actively and passionately live it every day until then. You have to deeply engage yourself in activities that move you. But the key thing to realize is that almost any activity can move you if you let it. You don’t need some massive, life-engulfing passion to suddenly appear in your life. Because real passion comes from within, and the source of passion in your life may be as simple as having a job to do — a job that feeds your family, for example — and feeling good about doing it right. So my challenge to you is this: Live your life not as a bystander. Live in this world, on this day, and every day hereafter as an active, passionate participant. Many of us are still hopelessly trying to “find our passion” — something we believe will ultimately lead us closer to happiness, success, or the life situation we ultimately want. And I say “hopelessly” primarily because passion can’t really be found. When we say we’re trying to find our passion, it implies that our passion is somehow hiding behind a tree or under a rock somewhere. But that’s far from the truth. The truth is, our passion comes from doing things right. If you’re waiting to somehow “find your passion” somewhere outside yourself, so you finally have a reason to put your whole heart and soul into your life and the small things you’re working on, you’ll likely be waiting around for an eternity. On the other hand, if you’re tired of waiting, and you’d rather live more passionately starting today, and experience more meaning in your life in the long run, it’s time to proactively inject passion into the very next thing you work on. Think about it: Like most of us, you’re likely putting a half-hearted and half-minded effort into most of the small things you do on a daily basis. Because you’re still waiting. You’re still waiting to “find” something to be passionate about — some magical reason to step into the life you want to create for yourself. But what you need to do is the exact opposite! When I was a kid, my grandmother used to tell me, “Stop waiting for better opportunities. The one you have in front of you is the best opportunity.” She also said, “Too often we spend too much time making it perfect in our heads before we ever even do it. Stop waiting for perfection and just do your best with what you have today, and then improve upon it tomorrow.” Believe it or not, recent psychological research indirectly reinforces my grandmother’s sentiments. For many years, psychologists believed our minds could directly affect our physical state of being, but never the other way around. Nowadays, however, it is widely documented that our bodies — for example, our momentary facial expressions and body posture — can directly affect our mental state of being too. So while it’s true that we change from the inside out, we also change from the outside in. And you can make this reality work for you. If you want more passion in your life right now, act accordingly right now. Put your whole heart and soul into something… Not into tomorrow’s opportunities, but the opportunity right in front of you. Not into tomorrow’s tasks, but today’s tasks. Not into tomorrow’s run, but today’s run. Not into tomorrow’s conversations, but today’s conversations. I’m absolutely certain you have plenty in your life right now that’s worth your time, energy, and passionate focus. You have people and circumstances in your life that need you as much as you need them. You have a massive reservoir of passionate potential within you, just waiting. So stop waiting! Put your heart and soul into the small things you’ve got right in front of you. Do so, and your long-lost passion will show up to greet you. And everything you do will start to feel more meaningful and memorable. (Note: Angel and I discuss all of this in more detail in the “Passion” chapter of our “1,000 Little Things” book.) Henry Wadsworth once said, “For after all, the best thing one can do when it is raining is to let it rain.” There’s a lot of wisdom in that line. And it’s all about acceptance… Acceptance is letting go and allowing things to be the way they truly are. It doesn’t mean you don’t care about improving the reality of your life; it’s just realizing that the only thing you really have control over is yourself and your thoughts about everything else. This simple understanding is the foundation, and only with this foundation can there be peace of mind and growth in the long run. It’s important to realize that, somewhere within us all, there does exist a supreme self who is eternally accepting and at peace. Because inner peace does not depend on external conditions; it’s what remains when you’ve surrendered your ego and worries. Peace can be found within you at any place and at any time. It’s always there, patiently waiting for you to turn your attention toward it. It arrives the moment you come to peace with what’s on your mind. But how? How do you change your inner state? There are many methods, but let’s start with some distance and breathing… Everything seems simpler from a distance. Sometimes you simply need to distance yourself to see things more clearly. You are more than whatever is troubling you. A very real part of you exists beyond your worries, beyond your doubts, independent from the troubles and frustrations of the present moment. Step back and observe this reality. Be present. Watch yourself as you think, as you take action, as you experience emotions. Your body may experience pain, and yet that pain is not you. Your mind may encounter troubles, and yet you are not those troubles. Think of the most difficult challenge you face right now. Imagine that it’s not you, but a close friend who is facing this challenge. What advice would you give her? If you could step back and, instead of being the subject, look at your situation as an objective observer, would you look at it any differently? Think of the advice you would give your friend if she were in your shoes. Are you following your own best advice right now? Don’t allow your current troubles to cloud your thinking. Take a few steps back and give yourself the benefit of this distance, and then give yourself some great advice. Perhaps this advice is to simply breathe… As you read these words, you are breathing. Stop for a moment and notice this breath. You can control this breath, and make it faster or slower, or make it behave as you like. Or you can simply let yourself inhale and exhale naturally. There is peace in just letting your lungs breathe, without having to control the situation or do anything about it. Now imagine letting other parts of your body breathe — like your tense shoulders. Just let them be, without having to tense them or control them. Just let them breathe. Now look around the room you’re in, and notice the objects around you. Pick one, and let it breathe. There are likely people in the room with you too, or in the same house or building, or in nearby houses or buildings. Visualize them in your mind, and let them breathe. When you let everything and everyone breathe, you just let them be, exactly as they are. You don’t need to control them, worry about them, or change them. You just let them breathe, in peace, and you accept them as they are. Practice this. Make it a daily ritual. And see how doing so gradually changes your life. (Note: Angel and I build healthy, life-changing daily rituals like this with our students in the “Goals & Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy Course, and we also establish a foundational ritual of consistency through daily journaling in our newest publication through Penguin Random House, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts & Reflections to Start Every Day”.) Goals are important as general guideposts in life. But goals don’t make positive changes happen, daily rituals do. Seriously, meditate on that for a moment. Because too often we obsess ourselves with a goal — an end result — but we’re completely unfocused when it comes to the ritual — the recurring steps — that ultimately make that goal happen. In other words, too often we overestimate the significance of one big defining moment and underestimate the value of 1,000 tiny steps. Take this to heart. In life, you can’t lift 1,000 pounds all at once, yet you can easily lift one pound 1,000 times. Tiny, repeated efforts will get you there. In fact, if you completely ignored one of your goals for the next few weeks and instead focused solely on the daily rituals that reinforce this goal, would you still get positive results? For example, if you were trying to lose weight and you ignored your goal to lose 25 pounds, and instead focused only on eating healthy and exercising each day, would you still get results? YES, you would! Gradually, you would get closer and closer to your goal without even thinking about it. Yes, it’s your turn to focus on the daily rituals that help you grow. So give yourself some credit right now for how far you’ve come in recent times, and then take another tiny step forward today.

Photo by: Cristian Newman 10 Harsh Realities that Will Help You Grow|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-harsh-realities.jpg?resize=500%2C346&ssl=1| All the world is full of suffering. It is also full of overcoming.— Helen Keller Character and wisdom are both sculpted over time. These qualities come with loss, lessons, and triumphs. They come after doubts, second guesses, and exploring unknowns. If there was a definitive path to personal growth, everyone would be on it. Truth be told, the seeds of your progress are often planted in your past failures. Some of your best stories will likely come from overcoming your greatest struggles. And your praises will be birthed from your growing pains. Marc and I learned some of this the hard way. Over the past fifteen years we have dealt with several significant hardships, including the sudden death of a sibling, the loss of a best friend to illness, betrayal from a business partner, an unexpected breadwinning employment layoff, and more. These experiences were brutal. Each of them knocked us down and kept us down for a while. But when our time of mourning was over after each tragedy, we pressed forward, stronger, and with a greater understanding and respect for life. So my challenge to you today is this: Start looking at life’s harsh realities and challenges as paths that ultimately lead to your growth. It’s about making the best of the path you’re currently on, even if it’s not the path you expected or wanted to be on. Easier said than done sometimes, of course, but here are a few key points to consider: The beginnings to good things are always the hardest, but it’s these hard steps that often pave the way to better times. Be strong and keep the faith; it will be worth it in the end. The greatest miracle of your success from this point forward will not be that you finished, it will be that you found the strength and courage to begin, again and again. And remember, it’s not that those who are strong never get weak in the knees, or that they never hold their breath before they embark, it’s that while their knees are shaking they force themselves to breathe and take the next tiniest step. Life is not easy. And progress usually comes gradually, not all at once. You must align your daily efforts with your near-term goals and then start every day ready to walk a little farther than you did yesterday, and perhaps fight a little harder than you ever have before. The bottom line is that persistence is the single most common characteristic of high achievers in all walks of life. They simply refuse to give up on the things that matter most to them. They have learned that the longer you hang in there, the greater the chance that something will happen in your favor. Because true growth is oftentimes the good fortune that comes from aspiration, desperation, perspiration, and inspiration. No matter how hard it seems, the more you persist, the more likely your success in the long run. The only thing you can absolutely control in life is how you react to things out of your control, and there’s a lot you can’t control. The better you adapt to this reality, the more powerful your highs will be, and the more quickly you’ll be able to bounce back from the lows. Put most simply: Living a happy, fulfilling life means being in a state of complete acceptance of all that is, right here, right now. As your life unfolds, you will often realize that many of the times you thought you were being rejected from something good, you were in fact being redirected to something better. You simply don’t have to control everything to find growth, happiness, or success. You just need to do your best every day, let go, and let life happen the way it’s supposed to. Because oftentimes the outcomes you can’t change end up changing you and helping you grow. (Note: Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Adversity” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently and throughout our new guided journal, The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts & Reflections to Start Every Day.) As Henry David Thoreau once said, “When it’s time to die, let us not discover that we have never lived.” Living is a risk. Happiness is a risk. If you’re not a little uncertain sometimes, then you’re not doing it right. Don’t worry about mistakes and failures, worry about what you’re giving up when you don’t even try. Worry about the life you’re not living and the happiness you’re forgoing, as you merely exist in the safety of your comfort zone 24/7. Give yourself permission to be one of the people who survived doing it wrong, who made mistakes, but recovered from them and grew stronger. The mind is indeed your biggest battleground. It’s the place where the fiercest conflict resides. It’s where half the things you feared would happen, never actually happened. It’s where your expectations get the best of you. And it’s where you fall victim to your own train of thought time and time again. Truly, the primary cause of unhappiness and defeat on the average day is rarely the current situation, but instead your inner resistance to it. Inner growth on the other hand usually comes down to acceptance of the current situation, and then taking constructive action. Human beings become quite remarkable when they start thinking that they can do great things, right now, without needing anything more. When you gain trust in yourself and the present moment, you have discovered the first secret of growth and success. Because finding your way is not about going somewhere new every second; it’s about seeing familiar ground in new ways. Once you do, you will realize the only difference between stumbling blocks and stepping stones is how you use them. (Read The Last Lecture.) If you’d rather be surrounded by pristine objects of little significance than by the traces of happy, passionate memories, stay focused on acquiring tangible possessions. Otherwise, stop fixating on things you can touch and start caring about the things that touch you. Each of us has a unique fire in our heart for something that makes us feel alive. It’s your duty to find it and keep it lit. Whatever you do, don’t completely sacrifice your life for your livelihood. Enjoy the gifts money can’t buy. Promise yourself that you will stay true to your loves, your values, and your purpose through thick and thin. Let your heart and mind work as one. Do what it takes so that one day, many moons from now, you can look back at your life, take one final breath, and crack an honest smile. If you take every insult or rude remark personally, you will be offended for the rest of your life. One of the most freeing things we learn in life is that we don’t have to agree with everyone, everyone doesn’t have to agree with us, and that’s OK. As Bruce Lee once said, “I’m not in this world to live up to your expectations and you’re not in this world to live up to mine.” Live by this quote. Don’t let the opinions of others make you forget. It takes a long time to learn how to NOT judge yourself through someone else’s eyes, but once you do the world is yours to explore freely. We have all been placed on this earth to discover our own life, and we will never be happy or successful if we try to live someone else’s idea of it. So give up worrying too much about what others think of you. And note to self: Taking a step back to gracefully walk away from situations that threaten your peace of mind, values, morals, or self-worth, is almost always a healthy and necessary step forward. It’s during the toughest times of your life that you’ll get to see the true colors of the people who say they care about you. Notice who sticks around and who doesn’t, and be grateful to those who leave you, for they have given you the room to grow in the space they abandoned, and the awareness to appreciate the people who loved you when you didn’t feel lovable. Bottom line: Be okay with giving the gift of your absence to those who do not appreciate and respect your presence. Chuck Palahniuk once said, “The only way to find true happiness is to risk being completely cut open.” Nothing could be closer to the truth. Some sadness is necessary. Everything in life is two-sided. You can’t expect to feel pleasure without ever feeling pain, joy without ever feeling sorrow, confidence without ever feeling fearful, hope without ever feeling uncertain, etc. There is no such thing as a one-sided coin in life, with which you can buy a pain-free, trouble-free life. Life is a series of highs and lows — an adventure that requires you to take chances and actions that have the possibility of both success (happiness) and failure (sadness). In the end, it’s going to be OK… maybe not immediately, but eventually. Of course, there will be times when it seems like everything that could possibly go wrong is going wrong. You might feel like you will be stuck in this rut forever, but you won’t. Sure the sun stops shining sometimes, and you may get a huge thunderstorm or two, but eventually the sun will come out to shine. Sometimes it’s just a matter of us staying as present and positive as possible in order to make it to see the sun break through the clouds again. And remind yourself that the trick on the average day is to enjoy the little things. Don’t wish away all your days waiting for better ones ahead. Just do your best to appreciate where you are. You’ve come a long way, and you’re still learning and growing. Be thankful for the progress and lessons. Take them and make the best of things right now. Yes, it’s your turn to make yourself a priority today and in the days ahead. Because you won’t always be a priority to others, and that’s why you need to be a priority to yourself. Practice respecting yourself, taking care of yourself, and gradually growing into a more reliable part of your own support system.

"10 Life Choices You Won’t Regret in 10 Years|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-choices-wont-regret.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| I don’t regret the things I’ve done; I regret the things I didn’t do when I had the chance. In the end, more than anything else, we regret the chances we didn’t take, the relationships we were too afraid to have, and the decisions we waited too long to make. Think about it… The big opportunity you procrastinated on. That friend you never called. Those important words you left unspoken. You know what I’m talking about. Every one of us has experienced feelings of regret. But it’s not too late to set things straight. We’re still here breathing.  Today we have an opportunity to change tomorrow. Right now we can choose to erase regret from our later years. It’s time to make the best of each and every day. Here are some ideas to get you started – ten things you can start doing now that you won’t regret 10 years down the road: If you’re struggling with any of these points, know that you are not alone. Many of us are right there with you, working hard to feel better, think more clearly, and live a life free of regrets. This is precisely why Angel and I wrote our book, “1,000 Little Things Happy Successful People Do Differently”.  It’s filled with short, concise tips on how to do just that. And believe it or not, Angel and I review a lot of our own material on a regular basis too, just to center our minds on these positive principles. The bottom line is that it’s never too late to take a step in the right direction. It’s never too late to become the person you are capable of being. Things can change if you want them to, at any age. Right now you have an opportunity to write yourself a future full of peace and free of regret… 2023 is YOUR year! What would you add to the list? What point in this post resonated the most? What have YOU done lately that you know you will NOT regret in 10 years? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts and insights with us.

That is one of the greatest struggles many of us deal with on a daily basis, myself included. Because letting go of control goes directly against our modernized, industrialized way of living – we are go-getters, doers, architects of our destiny. We build things and make things happen on our own terms; we don’t wait for anything to happen on someone else’s terms! At least that’s what I learned growing up from teachers, sports coaches, movies, songs, magazine articles, and so forth. So allowing things to happen was not in my DNA. I had never been one to sit back and passively let go of control. Over the years, however, my perspective has shifted. I’ve learned the hard way that a great deal of the control we believe we have over our lives is an illusion. For example, I’ve since met…. It happens every day – situations we think we have control over, but we really don’t. So what can we do? Let GO!  Be mindful… I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the mind is our biggest battleground. It’s the place where the strongest conflict resides. It’s where half of the things we thought were going to happen, never did happen. It’s where our expectations always get the best of us. It’s where we fall victim to our cravings to control the uncontrollable. And if we allow these thoughts and cravings to dwell in our minds, they will succeed in robbing us of peace, joy, and ultimately our lives. We will think ourselves into deep heartache and even depression. Truthfully, there’s so much about life that we can’t control, it makes no sense to waste all our energy on these things and then blatantly neglect everything we CAN control. We can decide how we spend our time right now, whom we socialize with – whom we share our lives with. We can choose to love and appreciate the people in our lives for exactly who they are. We can choose how we’re going to respond to life’s surprises and disappointments when they arise, and whether we will see them as curses or opportunities for personal growth. And most importantly, we can choose to adjust our attitudes and let go of all our worries about everything we can’t control, which in turn frees us up to take the next best step forward in our lives. Like you, I still struggle with letting go of control sometimes. So I’ve implemented a simple strategy for helping myself with this predicament. In a nutshell, I proactively remind myself NOT to worry about things I can’t control. Anytime I catch myself doing so, I pause and read the following seven quotes (taken from our books and email newsletter archive) to myself. Then I take some deep breaths, and reassess the situation with a more mindful presence… And because there’s an obvious correlation to this post, I’ll leave you with a little something I have pinned to my office bulletin board for 2023: 5 Rules of Happiness: Which quote or reminder above resonated the most with you? And what else do you try to keep in mind to stop yourself from worrying about things you can’t control? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts and insights with us.

When you first awake, be mindful and take a second to think about what a privilege it is to simply be alive and relatively healthy. Breathe onto the bathroom mirror just to see how amazing your breath looks. The moment you start acting like life is a blessing, I assure you it will start to feel like one. And when you start the day in a mindful state like this, it’s easier to focus more effectively on what matters most. If you’d like to practice starting your mornings more mindfully in the year ahead, below you will find 52 good morning quotes – one for each week of the year. I choose one of these quotes every Sunday morning and sit quietly for two minutes, repeating it silently in my mind as if I were meditating. I also write it on a post-it note and stick it next to my computer monitor for the duration of the week. This weekly ritual has helped reduce unnecessary stress in my life by reminding me to keep things simple, peaceful, and in perspective. Perhaps this practice can add value to your life, too, in the year ahead. (And keep in mind that you can start this practice anytime you want – it doesn’t have to be January 1.)

Because asking the right questions is often the answer. In a recent email newsletter I wrote: “Quiet your mind. Don’t think outside the box in the year ahead. Think like there is no box.” To my surprise, over 100 people quoted this line and responded with the same general question: “How?” I’ve spent the morning thinking about how to answer this question in the most universal way possible, and I’ve decided that the simplest explanation I can give is this: Ask yourself better questions – questions that focus your thoughts and filter out the excess noise that’s been cluttering your mind. The calming and healing power of a positive imagination is unleashed by constraining your focus. Constraints drive creativity and force mindful thinking. It may sound counterintuitive at first but, in a backwards way, you break out of the box by stepping into the right shackles. And that’s exactly what the questions below can help you with – shackling the noise in your head by channeling your focus into meaningful thoughts and moments of self-refection. Let these questions shift your perspective and guide you forward. 1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  8.  9.  10.  11.  12.  13.  14.  15.  16.  17.  18.  19.  20.  21.  22.  23.  24.  25.  26.  27.  28.  29.  30.  31.  32.  33.  34.  35.  36.  37.  38.  39.  40.

"4 Life Lessons You Will Gradually Learn as You Let Go of the Past|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/4-let-go-of-the-past.jpg?resize=500%2C338&ssl=1| If somebody is working on themselves and changing for the better, it’s unnecessary to keep bringing up their past. People can change and grow. You know that’s true. But have you given yourself a fair chance to change and grow, too? Have you consciously loosened your grip on what’s behind you, so you can step forward again with grace? If you’re shaking your head, you aren’t alone. At times we all fall victim to our attachments. We simply don’t realize how often we block our own present blessings by holding on to the past. Thus, it’s time for a quick true story about life and letting go… She rarely makes eye contact. Instead, she looks down at the ground. Because the ground is safer. Because unlike people, it expects nothing in return. She doesn’t have to feel ashamed about her past. The ground just accepts her for who she is right now. As she sits at the bar next to me, she stares down at her vodka tonic, and then the ground, and then her vodka tonic. “Most people don’t get me,” she says. “They ask me questions like, ‘What’s your problem?’ or ‘Were you beaten as a child?’ But I never respond. Because I don’t feel like explaining myself. And I don’t think they really care anyway.” Just then, a young man sits down at the bar on the opposite side of her. He’s a little drunk and says, “You’re pretty. May I buy you a drink?” She stays silent and looks back down at the ground. After an awkward moment, he accepts the rejection, gets up, and walks away. “Would you prefer that I leave too?” I ask. “No,” she says without glancing upward. “But I could use some fresh air. You don’t have to come, but you can if you want to.” I follow her outside and we sit on a street curb in front of the bar. “Brrr… it’s a really chilly night!” “Tell me about it,” she says while maintaining her usual downward gaze. The warm vapor from her breath cuts through the cold air and bounces off of the ground in front of her. “So why are you out here with me? I mean, wouldn’t you rather be inside in the warmth, talking to normal people about normal things?” “I’m out here because I want to be. Because I’m not normal. And look, I can see my breath, and we’re in San Diego. That’s not normal either. Oh, and you’re wearing old Airwalk sneakers, and so am I — which may have been normal in 1994, but not anymore.” She glances up at me and smirks, this time exhaling her breath upward into the moonlight. “I see you’re wearing a ring. You’re married, right?” “Yeah,” I reply. “My wife, Angel, is just getting off work now and heading here to meet me for dinner.” She nods her head and then looks back at the ground. “Well, you’re off the market… and safe, I guess. So can I tell you a story?” “I’m listening.” As she speaks, her emotional gaze shifts from the ground, to my eyes, to the moonlit sky, to the ground, and back to my eyes again. This rotation continues in a loop for the duration of her story. And every time her eyes meet mine she holds them there for a few seconds longer than she did on the previous rotation. I don’t interject once. I listen to every word. And I assimilate the raw emotion present in the tone of her voice and in the depth of her eyes. When she finishes, she says, “Well, now you know my story. You think I’m a freak, don’t you?” “Place your right hand on your chest,” I tell her. She does. “Do you feel something?” I ask. “Yeah, I feel my heartbeat.” “Now close your eyes, place both your hands on your face, and move them around slowly.” She does. “What do you feel now?” I ask. “Well, I feel my eyes, my nose, my mouth… I feel my face.” “That’s right,” I reply. “But unlike you, stories don’t have heartbeats, and they don’t have faces. Because stories are not alive — they’re not people. They’re just stories.” She stares into my eyes for a prolonged moment, smiles sincerely and says, “Just stories we live through.” “Yeah… And stories we learn from.” The woman from the story above became one of our very first students when Angel and I opened the doors to the original version of the Getting Back to Happy Course nearly a decade ago, and she’s now a friend of ours too. She has learned and applied many remarkable lessons over the years that ultimately allowed her to let go of her difficult past — her story — and move forward with her life. And last night I sat down with her over a glass of wine and had an in-depth, soul-centered conversation about what she has learned over the years. I’m sharing her story and lessons with you today, with full permission, because I know we all struggle in similar ways. Here are four actionable lessons we discussed: In the present moment we all have some kind of pain: anger, sadness, frustration, disappointment, regret, etc. Notice this pain within yourself, watch it closely, and see that it’s caused by whatever story you have in your head about what happened in the past (either in the recent past or in the distant past). Your mind might insist that the pain you feel is caused by what happened (not by the story in your head about it), but what happened in the past is NOT happening right now. It’s over. It has passed. But the pain is still happening right now because of the story you’ve been subconsciously telling yourself about that past incident. Note that “story” does not mean “fake story.” It also does not mean “true story.” The word “story” in the context of your self-evaluation doesn’t have to imply true or false, positive or negative, or any other kind of forceful judgment call. It’s simply a process that’s happening inside your head: So just notice what story you have, without judging it, and without judging yourself. It’s natural to have a story; we all have stories. See yours for what it is. And see that it’s causing you pain. Then take a deep breath, and another… Inner peace begins the moment you take these deep breaths and choose not to allow the past to rule your present thoughts and emotions. (Note: Angel and I discuss this process in more detail in the “Happiness” chapter of our “1,000 Little Things” book and throughout our new guided journal, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts & Reflections to Start Every Day”.) All of the things from our past that we desperately try to hold on to, as if they’re real, solid, everlasting fixtures in our lives, aren’t really there. Or if they are there in some form, they’re changing, fluid, impermanent, or simply imagined storylines in our minds. Life gets a lot easier to deal with the moment we understand this. Imagine you’re blindfolded and treading water in the center of a large swimming pool, and you’re struggling desperately to grab the edge of the pool that you think is nearby, but really it’s not—it’s far away. Trying to grab that imaginary edge is stressing you out, and tiring you out, as you splash around aimlessly trying to holding on to something that isn’t there. Now imagine you pause, take a deep breath, and realize that there’s nothing nearby to hold on to. Just water around you. You can continue to struggle with grabbing at something that doesn’t exist… or you can accept that there’s only water around you, and relax, and float. Today I challenge you to ask yourself: Then imagine the thing you’re trying to hold on to doesn’t really exist. Envision yourself letting go… and just floating. How might that change your life from this moment forward? (Note: Angel and I build small daily rituals for letting go of the past with our students in the “Pain & Hardship” module of the Getting Back to Happy Course.) When we’re still working through a painful experience from the past, it’s easy to feel like we’re going through it alone — like no one else could possibly understand how we feel. In a way, we subconsciously place ourselves at the center of the universe, and see everything that happened exclusively from the viewpoint of how it affects us personally, without regard for anyone else. But as we grow through our pain and gradually broaden our horizons, we begin to see that our self-centered thinking is only fueling our misery. And we realize that shifting our focus onto others for a while can help. It’s one of life’s great paradoxes: when we serve others, we end up benefiting as much if not more than those we serve. So whenever you feel pain from the past trying to suck you back in, shift your focus from your circumstances to the circumstances of those near and far. The simplest way of doing this at any given moment? Practice letting your breath be an anchor for global healing. Breathe in whatever painful feeling you’re feeling, and breathe out relief from that pain for everyone in the world who is suffering alongside you. For example: Do this for a minute or two as often as you need to, imagining all the pain of those near and far coming in with each breath, and then a feeling of compassion and reconciliation radiating out to all of those who are in pain as you breathe out. Instead of running from your past and the pain it caused you, you’re embracing it… you’re letting yourself absorb it. And you’re thinking of others as well, which gets you out of that miserable, self-centered mindset trap. Even when your past — your story — tries to pull you back in, you can consciously do your best to focus on your present blessings. What do you see in your life right now? Be thankful for the good parts. For your health, your family, your friends, or your home. Many people don’t have these things. Remind yourself that the richest human is rarely the one who has the most, but the one who needs less. Wealth is a daily mindset. Want less and appreciate more today. Easier said than done of course, but with practice gratitude does get easier. And as you practice, you transform your past struggles into present moments of freedom. Ultimately, on the average day, happiness is letting go of what you assume your life is supposed to be like right now and sincerely appreciating it for everything that it is. So at the end of this day, before you close your eyes, be at peace with where you’ve been and grateful for what you have right now. Life has goodness. Again, the lessons above take practice to fully grasp in real time. So just do your best to bring awareness to this gradually — to practice — so you can let go one day at a time. Keep reminding yourself… Be here now and breathe. And before you go, please leave Angel and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay.

Try Again: How to Restore the Unwavering Faith You Once Had in Yourself|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/try-again-today.jpg?resize=500%2C332&ssl=1| When I was a high school freshman, a 260-pound freshman girl showed up for track and field tryouts right alongside me. Her name was Sara, and she was only there because her doctor said her health depended on it. But once she scanned the crowd of students who were on the field, she turned around and began walking away. Coach O’Leary saw her, jogged over, and turned her back around. “I’m not thin enough for this sport!” Sara declared. “And I’ll never be! It’s impossible for me to lose enough weight. I’ve tried.” Coach O’Leary nodded, and promised Sara that her body type wasn’t suited for her current weight. “It’s suited for 220 pounds,” he said. Sara looked confused. “Most people tell me I need to lose 130 pounds,” she replied. “But you think I only need to lose 40?” Coach O’Leary nodded again. Sara started off as a shot put competitor, but spent every single afternoon running and training with the rest of the track team. She was very competitive, and by the end of our freshman year she was down to 219 pounds. She also won 2nd place in the countywide shot put tournament that year. Three years later, during our senior year, she won 3rd place in the 10K county run. Her competitive weight at the time was 132 pounds. There was a time when Sara was convinced that it was impossible to lose weight because, in her past experience, it had never worked out the way she had hoped. She had completely lost faith in herself. But with consistency — with a daily ritual of trying again and again — she restored her faith and achieved the “impossible.” And when Sara showed up to my 40th birthday pool party and BBQ last year, I smiled when I overheard another guest that she had just met compliment her on her bathing suit and physique. Of course, Sara still works really hard — she tries again — every single day to maintain what she has achieved. And, so do I… Some people get this idea about me, because I’m a New York Times bestselling author and coach who has spent the past decade writing and teaching people how to create more success and happiness in their lives, that I don’t ever fall short and fail miserably in these areas. But of course I do — I’m human. I fall short and fail at things far more than anyone could imagine, and certainly far more than I’d often like to admit. And it feels just as horrible for me as it does for you or anyone else — I absolutely lose faith in myself sometimes. Deep down of course, I know these negative reactions aren’t helpful. So I own up to what happened, learn a lesson or two, and then I get back up to try again. And the final part is the most important part — the trying again… When I try again and again, I often succeed and feel much better about myself in the long run. If there’s only one thing you take away from this article, let it be that trying again — giving yourself another chance every day — is always worth it. Because… Many of the most meaningful results you will ever achieve in your life — the milestones, the relationships, the love, the lessons — come from the little things you do repeatedly, every single day. Regardless of your unique talents, knowledge, life circumstances, or how you personally define success and happiness, you don’t suddenly become successful and happy. You become successful and happy over time based on your willingness to try again and again — to create little daily rituals that amass gradual progress, through thick and thin. So what do your little daily rituals look like? You really have to sort this out and get consistent with what’s right for you on a daily basis. Because failure occurs in the same way — it’s gradual. All your little daily failures (those that you don’t learn and grow from) come together and cause you to fail big. Think in terms of running a business: Then one day you wake up and your whole business has failed. It was all the little things you did or didn’t do on a daily basis — your rituals — not just one inexplicable, catastrophic event. Now, think about how this relates to your life: your life is your “business!” Too often people overestimate the significance of one big defining moment and underestimate the value of making good decisions and small steps of progress on a daily basis. Don’t be one of them! Keep reminding yourself that the vast majority of the results in your life — positive and negative alike — are the product of many small decisions made over time. The little things you do today, and tomorrow, and the next day, truly matter! The concept of taking it one day at a time, one step at a time, might seem ridiculously obvious, but at some point we all get caught up in the moment and find ourselves yearning for instant gratification. We want what we want, and we want it now! And this yearning often tricks us into taking on too much too soon. Angel and I have seen this transpire hundreds of times over the years: a coaching client or course student wants to achieve a big goal (or three) all at once, and can’t choose just one or two daily rituals to focus on, so nothing worthwhile ever gets done, and gradually they lose more and more faith in themselves. Let this common mistake — this quick-fix mentality — be your wake-up call today. You really can’t lift a thousand pounds all at once, yet you can easily lift one pound a thousand times. Small, repeated, incremental efforts will get you there. It doesn’t happen in an instant, but it does happen a lot faster than not getting there at all. Do your best to consciously shift your daily focus away from the big goals you want to achieve in your life, and redirect your focus toward the little daily rituals that actually support those goals. Consider the following: Now consider this small excerpt from our New York Times bestselling book: “If you stopped focusing on one of your big goals for a while and instead focused exclusively on your corresponding daily ritual, would you still make progress? For example, if you were trying to lose weight and you stopped thinking about your goal to lose twenty pounds, and instead placed all of your focus on eating healthy and exercising every day, would you still lose weight? Yes, without a doubt! Gradually you would get closer to your goal — your target weight — without even thinking about it again.” And if you mess up occasionally? You own up to it, you forgive yourself, and you try again. One day at a time, one step at a time, you get to… Restoring your faith in yourself is arguably the most significant hidden benefit of consistently practicing a daily ritual — of trying again and again and again. In fact, what I lacked before I learned to implement these kinds of daily rituals was the faith that I was actually capable of achieving the positive results I desired in my life. I had tried so many quick fixes in the past that ended in failure, and had grown so discouraged in myself, that I began subconsciously choosing procrastination over future attempts to fulfill the little promises I made to myself. In essence, I lost faith in both my ability and myself. It’s kind of like another person constantly lying to you — eventually you stop trusting them. The same holds true with the little promises you make to yourself that always end in disappointment. Eventually, you stop trusting yourself. And the solution in most cases is the same too: you have to restore your faith and trust gradually, with small promises, small steps (your daily rituals), and small victories. Again, this process takes time, but it happens if you stick to it. And it’s undoubtedly one of the most life-changing things you can do for yourself. (Note: Angel and I build and customize tiny, life-changing daily rituals with our students in the “Goals & Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy Course, and we also establish a foundational ritual of consistency through daily journaling in our newest publication through Penguin Random House, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts & Reflections to Start Every Day”.) Don’t wish away any more time waiting for better times ahead. Just appreciate where you are and try again. If you diligently take small steps day after day, one day you’ll look back with gratitude for how far you have come, and you’ll look forward with unwavering faith in yourself and the next step.

Oprah keeps a journal. Taylor Swift keeps a journal. Eminem keeps a journal. Successful people all over the world — those who consistently make positive changes in their lives — reflect daily and learn from their life experiences. And they often use some kind of journal to accomplish this. If you want to get somewhere in life, you need a map, and your journal is that map. You can write down what you did today, what you tried to accomplish, where you made mistakes, and so much more. It’s a place to reflect. It’s a place to capture important thoughts. It’s a place to sort out where you’ve been and where you intend to go. And it’s one of the most underused, yet incredibly effective tools available to the masses. Just this morning, I spent fifteen minutes journaling about some recent events in my life that I’m grateful for, and some that are still troubling me. As I was wrapping up, the idea for the blog post you’re reading now came to me, which was a pleasant surprise since I hadn’t yet decided what I was going to share with you today. I also unearthed some incredibly healthy insights regarding an important relationship that I had been neglecting, which motivated me to immediately send out a text message to someone I care about who I’ve been meaning to reconnect with. We now have a brunch date scheduled for next Sunday. So as you can infer, your time spent focusing inward and journaling doesn’t just help you — your mind is powerful and your thoughts create ripples in the world around you. When you bring clarity into your life, you bring the best of yourself into everything you do — you tend to treat yourself and others better, communicate more constructively, do things for the right reasons, and ultimately improve the world you’re living in. This is why journaling for a short time every day can actually make a significant real-world difference in your life. If you’re interested in getting started with journaling, or if you’d like some fresh ideas for your current journaling practice, I’ve listed 31 journal prompts below — gentle, paraphrased excerpts from our upcoming guided journal, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts & Reflections to Start Every Day”, which has a total of 365 prompts and is being published by Penguin Random House:  Marc and I have personally used these exact prompts in the past to nudge ourselves into self-reflection, and we continue to revisit them. They bring awareness to the subconscious beliefs and assumptions you have. And they help you think through situations, big and small, so you can make healthier decisions going forward. Challenge yourself to read and write on one prompt a day in the month ahead (roughly 31 days — and you can start on any day too). See how doing so gradually changes your life. (And then get yourself a copy of “The Good Morning Journal” so you can continue this life-changing practice gradually in the months ahead. Also, email me at [email protected] if you order today, so I can reply to you with four inspiring and useful pre-order bonus books.) Forgive yourself for the bad decisions you’ve made, for the times you lacked understanding, for the choices that hurt others and yourself. Forgive yourself, for being young and reckless. These are all vital lessons. And what matters most right now is your willingness to grow from them. What specifically do you need to forgive yourself for? What have your errors in judgment taught you? The mind is your battleground. It’s the place where the fiercest conflict resides. It’s where half the things you feared would happen, never actually happened. It’s where your expectations get the best of you, and you fall victim to your own train of thought time and time again. What’s one thought that has been getting the best of you lately? How has it been influencing your behavior? What you focus on grows. Stop micromanaging your time. Start better managing your focus. 95% of what stressed you out recently won’t matter a month from now. Shake off the nonsense, bring your attention back to what’s important, and move forward with your life. What is truly worth focusing on today? What is NOT? Happiness on the average day is letting go of what you assume your life is supposed to be like right now, and sincerely appreciating it for everything that it is. So RELAX. You are enough. You have enough. You do enough. Breathe deep… let go, and just live right now in the moment. What do you appreciate most about your life right now? Why? A tiny part of your life is decided entirely by uncontrollable circumstances, while the vast majority of it is decided by your internal responses to those circumstances. Let this sink in. Regardless of what’s going on around you, peace of mind arrives the moment you come to peace with what’s on your mind. What is one reality you need to come to peace with? Why? It’s funny how we outgrow what we once thought we couldn’t live without, and then we fall in love with what we didn’t even know we wanted. Life keeps leading us on journeys we would never go on if it were up to us. Don’t be afraid. Have faith. Find the lessons. Trust the journey. What’s something you’ve let go that once meant the world to you? And what’s something you love today that you never even knew you needed in your life? Most of the time you have a choice. If you don’t like a changeable aspect of your life, it’s time to start making changes and new choices. And it’s OK to be low-key about it. You don’t need to put everything on TikTok and Instagram. Silently progress and let your actions speak for themselves. Over the past month, what have your actions been silently saying about your priorities? Are there any changes you want to make? If so, elaborate. We waste our time waiting for the ideal path to appear, but it never does. Because we forget that paths are made by walking, not waiting. And no, you shouldn’t feel more confident before you take the next step. Taking the next step is what builds your confidence. What’s the next step you’ve been thinking about taking for far too long? The next step means nothing if you are in love with your comfort zone and simply walking in circles. Don’t live the same day 30,000 times and call it a life! Growth begins today, at the end of your comfort zone. Dream. Attempt. Explore. This moment is the doorway to anything you want. How have you stretched your comfort zone in the past month (even slightly)? What did you learn from the experience? What’s one new comfort zone challenge you’d like to conquer? Your capacity to be happy is directly related to the quality of people whom most closely surround you. So be with those who are good for your mental health. Those who bring you inner peace. Those who challenge your bad habits, but also support your ability to change and grow. Who have you spent the most time with over the past month, and how have these people affected your life? Too often we say “life is not fair” while we’re snacking on food, sipping a drink, and reading social media posts on our smartphones. Think twice and be thankful. At the end of the day, before you close your eyes, breathe deeply, appreciate where you are, and see the value in what you have. What is one privilege you have that you often take for granted? When things aren’t adding up in your life, begin subtracting. Life gets a lot simpler when you clear the clutter that makes it complicated. Fill your life with lots of experiences, not lots of things. Have incredible stories to tell, not incredible clutter in your closets. What kinds of physical clutter have been complicating your life and diverting you from meaningful life experiences? Even when it seems personal, rarely do people do things because of you, they do things because of them.  You know this is true.  You may not be able control all the things people say and do to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.  Make that decision for yourself today. What’s something you often take too personally even though, logically, you know better?  How has this habit affected your life? You can’t control how other people receive your energy or communication. Anything you do or say gets filtered through the lens of these people’s opinions and past experiences, which oftentimes has nothing to do with you. Just keep doing your thing with as much love and honesty as possible. What’s one good, recent example of someone with a bad attitude (or someone genuinely suffering from past trauma) completely misjudging you? You won’t always be a priority to others, and that’s why you have to be a priority to yourself. Learn to respect yourself, take care of yourself, and become your own support system. Your needs matter. Start meeting them. Don’t wait on others to choose you. Choose yourself, today! How have you chosen yourself recently? How will you choose yourself today? Just breathe, be, and pay attention to what it’s like to be YOU. Nothing to fix. Nothing to change. Nowhere else to go. Just you, breathing, being, with presence, without judgment. You are welcome here. You belong here. Here, you are enough. Close your eyes. Breathe… What’s something true about yourself that you need to embrace more openly and lovingly? The wisest, most loving, and well-rounded people you have ever met are likely those who have been shattered at some point in their lives. Yes, life often creates the best humans by breaking them first. Their destruction into pieces allows them to be fine-tuned and reconstructed into a masterpiece. How has your past heartbreak or losses made you stronger, wiser, and more loving? Be specific. There’s a big difference between giving up and starting over in the right direction. Know when enough is enough already, and respect yourself for feeling that way. Sometimes we have to say goodbye before we can say hello. Sometimes we have to let go to move forward with our lives. What’s something from your past that you are thankful you gave up on? Why? Give yourself the space to hear your own voice — your own soul. Too many of us listen to the noise of the world and get lost in the crowd. Stand strong today! Live by choice, not by chance. Work to grow, not compete. Choose to listen to yourself, not the jumbled opinions of everyone else. What has your inner voice been trying to tell you lately? What does it mean? Forget popularity. Just do your thing with passion, humility, and honesty. Do what you do, not for an applause, but because it’s what’s right. Pursue it a little bit each day, no matter what anyone else thinks. That’s how dreams are achieved. What’s something that’s worth working on today, regardless of what other people think? Why is it important to you? If it entertains you now but will hurt or bore you someday, it’s a distraction. Don’t settle. Don’t exchange what you want most for what you kind of want at the moment. Study your habits. Figure out where your time goes, and remove distractions. It’s time to focus more on what matters most. What distractions have been getting the best of you lately? How often? Why? Don’t fall back into your old patterns of living just because they’re more comfortable and easier to access. Remember, you left certain habits and situations behind for a reason: to improve your life. And right now, you can’t move forward if you keep going back. What’s one old pattern of behavior that sometimes still sneaks up on you? What’s a better alternative and why? Your mind and body need to be exercised to gain strength. They need to be challenged consistently. If you haven’t pushed yourself in lots of little ways over time — if you always avoid doing the hard things — you’ll crumble on the inevitable days that are harder than you expected. How can you provide healthy challenges for both your mind and body on a daily basis? What will you do today to walk the talk? As you age, you’ll learn to value your time, genuine relationships, meaningful work, and peace of mind, much more. Little else will matter. Thus, the strongest sign of your growth is realizing you’re no longer worried or stressed by the trivial things that once used to drain you. What’s something that used to drive you crazy, but no longer bothers you? Why? Everybody you meet is afraid of something, loves something, and has lost something. Know this. Respect this. And be extra kind. Take time to really listen. Take time to learn something new. Take time to say thank you. Today. What can you easily do to be a little kinder than usual today? And who was the last person who was unexpectedly kind to you? People will rarely think and act exactly the way you want them to. Hope for the best but expect less. Agree to disagree when necessary. And be careful not to dehumanize those you disagree with. In our self-righteousness, we can easily become the very things we dislike in others. How have your recent expectations of others gotten the best of you? What happened, and what have you learned? Love what you do, until you can do what you love. Love where you are, until you can be where you love. Love the people you are with, until you can be with the people you love most. This is the way we find happiness, opportunity, and peace. How will you embody “love” today? What specifically will you do? The older we grow, the more peaceful we become. Life humbles us gradually as we age. We realize how much nonsense we’ve wasted time on. So, just do your best right now to feel the peace that flows from your decision to rise above the petty drama that doesn’t really matter. What kind of drama do you sometimes get caught up in? What can you do to rise above it? It’s not too late. You aren’t behind. You’re exactly where you need to be. Every step is necessary. Don’t judge or berate yourself for how long your journey is taking. We all need our own time to travel our own distance. Give yourself credit right now. And be thankful you made it this far. How far have you come? Seriously, how much have you grown? Think about the specifics of your recent and long-term growth. What have you not given yourself enough credit for? You’re not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or a week ago. You’re always growing. Experiences don’t stop. That’s life. And the very experiences that seem so hard when you’re going through them are often the ones you’ll look back on with gratitude for how far you’ve come. What’s the hardest thing you’re trying to accomplish or cope with right now? What’s something small and necessary about this struggle? There will come a time when you think it’s all over, everything is finished — you’ve reached the end of the road. That’s the starting line. Be humble. Be teachable. The world is often bigger than your view of the world. There’s always room for a new idea, a new step… a new beginning. What does a new beginning mean to you right now? What’s the next step? These morning journaling prompts will have little effect if they are not practiced consistently. One morning of journaling by itself won’t cut it. It is the compound effect of simple, seemingly mundane actions over time that leads to life-altering, positive results. There is nothing immediately exciting about putting one foot in front of the other every day for weeks, but by doing so, many normal human beings have climbed over 29,000 feet to the top of the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest. There is nothing immediately exciting about forcing yourself into self-reflection for a few minutes every day, but by doing so, hundreds of students and clients Marc and I have worked with over the years have drastically better lives. Remember, the mind needs to be trained to gain strength. It needs to be worked consistently to grow and develop over time. And that’s precisely what daily journaling will gradually allow you to achieve. If you don’t proactively push your mind in little positive ways every day, of course it’ll stumble on the days that are tougher than expected. You have a choice right now! Choose to put one foot in front of the other, when it would be easier to stay seated. Choose to open your journal at dawn, when it would be easier to sleep in. Prove to yourself, in little consistent ways, that you have the power to take control of your days and your life. (Reminder: Marc and I build the small, life-changing daily ritual of journaling with our readers in our newest publication, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts & Reflections to Start Every Day”. And if you pre-order it today and email me at [email protected], I’ll reply to you with four insightful bonus books attached.) Marc and I would love to hear from YOU before you go.

As I sat quietly in his hospice room alongside my grandma and other family members, his nurse smiled softly and said, “I can see he lived well. People his age often pass just the way they lived.” And as I drove home that evening, a couple questions kept cycling through my mind… “Am I living well?” “What do I want to be able to smile about on the inside when I’m on my deathbed?” These questions are tough, especially the second one. At the time, I desperately struggled to envision myself on my deathbed — just thinking about it stressed me out. So I simply avoided the question and the soul searching it demanded of me. I distracted myself for a few more years until I found myself back in a hospice room with my 90-year-old grandma (who was the most amazing human being I’ve ever met, by the way). On the final day of her life, I sat with my grandma for the entire day, in silence, in laughter, in tears, and in awe of a woman who was still smiling and sharing stories despite incredible weakness and pain. Her mind was amazingly strong even just a few short hours before her death. So I gave her my undivided attention — I soaked up her wisdom one last time. And I was all ears until she asked me a version of that question I had avoided a few years earlier. “Do you know why I’m smiling right now?” she asked me. “Because you lived well,” I said. She smiled even wider, and then she spent the next hour speaking softly and passionately about her life and the reasons for her present happiness. It was without a doubt one of the most enlightening and unforgettable hours of my life. Immediately afterward, she took a nap — one of her final naps — and I wrote a journal entry about everything she spoke of. Although I’ve shared many of her insights and quotes with blog subscribers and course students in the past, today would have been my grandmother’s 101st birthday, so I’d like to honor her once again. And to do so, I’m going to share an expanded version of the notes from that specific journal entry I wrote in her hospice room over two decades ago. It’s her wisdom with my twist. I’ve done my best to convey what she told me in five inspiring points — the five reasons my grandma smiled genuinely on her deathbed: One of my grandma’s favorite quotes was by Walt Disney: “Around here, we don’t look backwards for very long. We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we’re curious — and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.” It inspired my grandma for decades, and it still inspires me every day to write and create — to move on to my next piece of work, even when I catch myself judging my last piece of work as “not good enough.” For example, it’s been nearly 17 years now that I’ve been publishing new articles every week on Marc & Angel Hack Life. Sometimes the ideas and words come easier than others, and there have been plenty of times when I’ve felt like my work was sub-par. “I thought this was a great article. Why aren’t people reading and sharing it?” Or I’ll feel like I fumbled through an article only to watch it receive 10,000+ shares on social media. Regardless of which outcome I’m dealing with, my grandma’s wisdom always reminds me of one key point: As human beings, we are often terrible judges of our own work. We are just too self-critical to see the truth most of the time. And not only that, it’s not our job to judge our own work. It’s not our job to compare it to everyone else’s work, or to how we thought others would perceive it. There’s no use in doing that. Instead, it’s our job to create. Our job is to share what we have right now in this moment. Our job is to come as we are and give it our best shot, every single day. That’s how my grandma lived her life. She was a true artist in that way. Realize that there are people in nearly every career field who make each day a work of art simply by the way they have mastered their craft. Yes, almost everyone is an artist in some way. And every artist will have the tendency to judge their own work. The important thing is to not let your self-judgment talk you out of doing your thing and sharing your creative and unique gifts with the world. Just like Walt said, the key is to “keep moving forward.” Sadly, most people give up on their life stories far too early. They come out of school or college wanting to change the world, wanting to build an enterprise, wanting to make lots of money, wanting to start a family and live happily ever after. But they get into the middle of it all and discover it’s way harder than they anticipated. They encounter many setbacks, and they can’t see anything over the distant horizon anymore. So they wonder if their efforts are moving them forward. None of the trees behind them are getting smaller and none of the ones ahead are getting larger, at least not fast enough. So they take it out on their family and friends, or themselves, and they go aimlessly looking for an easier path that doesn’t fulfill them. Don’t be one of these people. My grandmother had a Winston Churchill quote hanging in her home office that said, “Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.” And she strongly believed that good things don’t come easy. “True strength consists of what you do on the third, fourth and fifth tries,” she told me. Take this to heart! Never give up on your journey. Never stop trying. Never sell out or sell yourself short. Life is tough, but you are tougher. Your journey isn’t supposed to be easy, it’s supposed to be worth it. To never struggle is to never grow. It doesn’t matter what’s happened or what you’ve done; what matters is what you choose to do from here. Accept the circumstances, learn from them, and take another step forward. “Remember, you don’t know what the future will bring. So your best bet for living is to make the best and most positive use of the present,” my grandma said. The universe is always talking to us — sending us little messages, causing coincidences and serendipitous events, reminding us to stop, to look around, and to believe in something special, something more. But this special something isn’t somewhere else. It’s right where you are. Sometimes you have to stop searching, and just BE. You aren’t missing anything anywhere else. You’re only missing the goodness in front of you. Let me assure you, you could run around trying to do everything, and travel around the world, and always stay connected, and work and party all night long without sleep, but you could never do it all. You will always be missing something, and thus it will always seem like something amazing might be happening elsewhere. Focusing on this is obviously futile. Hustle, work hard, and seek adventure, but do it with your eyes wide open and focused on your present step. You have everything right now. The best in life isn’t somewhere else — it’s right where you are at this moment. Notice it, and make it memorable. This point is a perfect successor to the previous one. Letting go isn’t about having the ability to forget the past, it’s about having the wisdom to embrace the present. Truth be told, the more you talk about it, debate it, rethink it, rehash it, cross-analyze it, get paranoid about it, track it, respond to it, contend with it, complain about it, immortalize it, cry over it, kick it, insult it, gossip about it, pray over it, put it down or dissect its motives… it continues to fester and rot in your mind. It’s time to accept that it’s over! It’s dead! It’s gone. It’s done. It’s time to bury it because it’s stinking up your life, and no one wants to be near your rotted corpse of bad memories, or your decaying attitude. Be the funeral director of your past life and bury that thing once and for all! “Every difficult life situation can be an excuse for hopelessness or an opportunity for growth, depending on what you choose to do with it right now,” my grandma told me. “We have to let go of the ideas, outcomes, and expectations that aren’t serving us.” Take pause when you must. Realize that holding on is being brave, but letting go and moving forward is often what makes us stronger and happier in the end. Give yourself this gift so you can grow and smile again, and again. (Note: Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Happiness” and “Adversity” chapters of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) My grandma’s personal heroes were educated visionaries and dreamers — those beautiful people among us who invest in themselves and then use what they’ve learned to make the world a better place than when they found it, whether in tiny ways or enormous ones. Some succeed, some fail, most have mixed results, but it’s the effort itself that’s heroic, as she saw it. Win or lose, my grandma admired those who intelligently fight for the greater good. And I couldn’t agree more with her sentiment. Don’t stop learning. Don’t stop investing in yourself. Study. Read. Devour books. Engage with people, including those who think differently. Ask questions. Listen closely. And don’t just grow in knowledge. Be a person who gives back. Use what you’re learning to make a difference. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “The purpose of life is not to simply be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.” I want to leave you with a paraphrased version of a poem by Bessie Anderson Stanley that my grandma used to have hanging on the side of her refrigerator when I was growing up. I think it perfectly embodies the overall message of this post, and the overall reason my grandma was smiling: “She has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often, and loved much; Who has enjoyed the trust of good women, the respect of good men, and the love of little children; Who has filled her niche and accomplished her task; Who has never lacked appreciation of life’s beauty or failed to express it; Who has left the world better than she found it, Whether an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul; Who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best she had; Whose life was an inspiration; Whose memory a benediction.” Angel and I would love to hear from YOU.

I wouldn’t have told myself all those little lies that prevented me from truly living every day of my life.’” I recorded those lines in my journal exactly 12 years ago today, right after I had a conversation with a good friend of mine who was desperately fighting for her life. It honestly still breaks my heart to know it was a battle she ultimately lost. She never awoke from that coma. For over a decade now I’ve lived with my late friend’s last words to me echoing in the back of my mind. I’ve let her sentiments guide me through thick and thin. Specifically, I’ve committed myself to noticing when those little lies she mentioned creep up in my subconscious mind. The list below is a highlight of those little lies, along with some key points of clarity I try to remember — some good reminders we all need. I pass this list on to you in hopes that the next time you decide to unclutter your life and clean up your space, you start with your intellectual space by clearing out the old subconscious lies and negative self-talk you sometimes recite to yourself. And I hope my friend’s last words to me linger in your mind too, as fuel for making every day count. It’s time to STOP telling yourself… I challenge you to put the reminders in this article to good use — to tune in to that inner voice of yours, and circumvent those little lies your subconscious mind likes to recite to you, so you can get out of your own way in the days and weeks ahead. And before you go, please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this post.

"10 Things We All Hold On To (Long After It’s Time To Let Go)|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/10-all-hold-on.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| Oftentimes you don’t even realize you’re blocking your own present blessings by holding on to everything so tightly. It’s time to start letting go. Letting go is not giving up. Letting go is surrendering any obsessive attachment to particular people, outcomes, and situations. Surrender means showing up in your life with the intention to be your best self, and to do the best you know how, without expecting life to always go your way. Have goals, have dreams, take purposeful action, and build great relationships, but detach from what life must look like every step of the way. The energy of someone aspiring to create something wonderful, teamed with this kind of surrender, is far more powerful and rewarding than someone determined to create outcomes with a desperate must-have mentality. Surrender brings inner peace and awareness, and lest we forget that our outer lives are a reflection of our inner state of being. Truly, when we let go of the way it “should be,” we free our minds to deal with life’s unexpected changes and challenges in the most effective way possible… We see the world through a clearer lens. We learn from our mistakes and the mistakes of others. We create space for acceptance, change, and growth. And gradually we begin to feel more in flow with life. With that said, I don’t always let go when I need to. And I don’t always flow with life. In fact, sometimes I do the exact opposite — I hold on even when I know better. Because I’m only human, and human beings have a tendency to hold on too tight… to almost everything! When I’m holding on too tight, I can really feel it in my gut too. I often feel anxious, frustrated, irritated, or upset. There’s an aching for things to be different than they are — a feeling of rejection or failure or hopelessness… Can you relate? I’m sure you can in some way. We all struggle with this more often than we even realize. And the vast majority of our torment can be alleviated with a healthy practice of letting go. So, let’s start by reminding ourselves of some things we typically hold on to long after it’s time to let go… Try to use frustration and inconvenience to motivate you rather than annoy you. You are in control of the way you look at life. Instead of getting angry, find the lesson. In place of envy, feel admiration. In place of worry, take action. In place of doubt, have faith. Remember that your response is always more powerful than your present circumstance. A small part of your life is decided by completely uncontrollable circumstances, while the vast majority of your life is decided by your responses. Where you ultimately end up is heavily dependent on how you play the hands you’ve been dealt. You’re not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or even a week ago. You’re always learning and growing, and life is always evolving. Even though you can’t control everything that happens, you can control your attitude about what happens. And in doing so, you will gradually master change rather than allowing it to master you. So be humble today. Be teachable. The world is bigger than your view of the world. There’s always room for a fresh idea or a next step. But first you must accept the fact that things may never go back to how they used to be, and that this ending is really a new beginning. Forgive yourself for the bad decisions you’ve made in the past, for the times you lacked understanding, for the choices that accidentally hurt others and yourself. Forgive yourself, for being young and reckless. These are all vital lessons. And what matters most right now is your willingness to grow from them. Be selective with your energy today. If you can fix a problem, fix it. If you can’t, then accept it and change your thoughts about it. Whatever you do, don’t attempt to invest more energy than you have, tripping over something behind you or something that only exists inside your head. Truth be told, some of the most powerful moments in life happen when you find the courage to let go of what can’t be changed. Because when you are no longer able to change a situation, you are challenged to change yourself — to grow beyond the unchangeable. And that changes everything. Too often we waste our time waiting for a path to appear, but it never does. Because we forget that paths are made by walking, not waiting. And we forget that there’s absolutely nothing about our present circumstances that prevents us from making progress again, one tiny step at a time. Everything gets a bit hard and uncomfortable when it’s time to change. That’s just a part of the growth process. Things will get better, one step at a time. And keep in mind that your effort is never wasted, even when it leads to disappointing results. For it always makes you stronger, more educated, and more experienced. So when the going gets tough, be patient and keep going. Just because you are struggling does not mean you are failing. Every great success requires some kind of worthy struggle to get there. Every difficult life situation can be an excuse for hopelessness or an opportunity for growth, depending on what you choose to do with it. In the midst of particularly hard days when I feel that I can’t endure, I try to remind myself that my track record for getting through hard days is 100% so far. And the same is true for YOU. We have what it takes! (Note: Marc and I discuss this further in the “Adversity” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Let others take you as you are, or not at all. Speak your truth even if your voice shakes. By being yourself, you put something beautiful into the world that was not there before. And in the long run it’s wiser to lose someone over being who you are, than it is to keep them by being someone you’re not. Because it’s easier to fill an empty space in your life where someone else used to be, than it is to fill the empty space inside yourself where YOU used to be. You’re going to mingle with a lot of people in your lifetime. You’re going to have first kisses you feel all the way down to your toes and think “Oh my gosh, I love him,” but really…you loved the kiss. You’re going to meet a friend you think you will know forever, but then something will change and you two will go your separate ways. You’re going to explore different parts of your life with different people who aren’t in it for the long haul, and that isn’t a bad thing. Life is a series of stories, and the way our stories intersect is remarkable. Sometimes people are in our lives for the whole story. Sometimes they are just a short chapter or two. It takes a brave person to know when that chapter is over, and then to turn the page. Be brave. Embrace your goodbyes, because every “goodbye” you receive in life sets you up for the next “hello.” We don’t always need more. We need appreciation. Because we often take for granted the very things that most deserve our attention and gratitude. How often do you pause to appreciate your life just the way it is? Look around right now, and be thankful… for your health, your family, your work, your comforts, your home. Nothing lasts forever. (Note: Our newest publication via Penguin Random House, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts & Reflections to Start Every Day”, is a great tool for this kind of perspective shift and gratitude practice.) Reflecting on the reminders above can be incredibly grounding at times, but what can you actively do if the immediate tension inside you is spiraling out of control? Here’s a brief outline of some initial steps Marc and I actively take (and cover with our course students and coaching clients) to cope with the immediate tension that arises from unfavorable outcomes in our lives: The bottom line is that when life dishes you a harsh dose of reality, the best first steps involve sitting silently and witnessing the thoughts passing through you. Just witnessing at first, not interfering and not even judging, because by judging too rapidly you have lost the pure witness. The moment you rush to say, “this is absolutely terrible” or “things should be different,” you have already jumped head first into the chaotic tension. It takes practice to create a gap between the witnessing of thoughts and your response to them. Once the gap is there, however, you are in for a great surprise — it becomes evident that you are not the thoughts themselves, nor the tension and chaos influencing them. You are the witness, a watcher, who’s capable of letting go, changing your mindset, and rising above the turmoil.

Maybe it’s the life lessons I was forced to learn the hard way, or the toll of loss and failure I had recently endured, but fifteen years ago in the midst of a panic attack on my 27th birthday, I had to admit to myself right then and there that the youthful world of possibility I once felt now seemed dead inside me. I wanted to feel light and free and ambitious and passionate again, but I didn’t know how. Luckily my wise mother, who has always been a true lifesaver, gave me some good advice. She told me that she could still see a positive, passionate young man inside of me, but that I needed to do some soul searching to reconnect myself to him. As I attempted to follow my mother’s advice, I remembered that I used to have two quotes written on post-it notes hanging on my bedroom wall when I was a kid: So I wrote those two quotes down again, just as I remembered them, and posted them up on the wall over my nightstand. I woke up to these quotes every morning for several years thereafter—they helped keep me centered. I also took tiny steps, day in and day out, until I knew I was finally moving down the right path again. For anyone else who feels stuck and without a strong sense of how to take the next step forward, I offer the following suggestions. They are actionable lessons that kept me moving forward even on the hardest days when I felt little passion for life. And although these strategies are based on my personal experiences, they’ve now also been vetted by their extensive use in hundreds of two-on-one coaching sessions that Angel and I have administered with our course students, live event attendees, and coaching clients over the years. Perhaps they will bring some life and verve back into your days, too, before any more time passes… You have to admit, you’ve spent a lot of your life subconsciously belittling yourself. Thinking you’re not enough. Trying to be someone else. Someone who fits in. Someone who’s less sensitive. Less needy. Less flawed. Less YOU. Because you felt broken, and you didn’t want to scare people away. You wanted them to like you. You wanted to make a good impression. You wanted to be seen as worthy and lovable. So you could feel healed and whole. And so for the longest time, behind a facade of fake smiles, you have inadvertently betrayed yourself for the purpose of pleasing everyone else. And for longest time, your heart has ached. But you’re at a point now where you’re seeing things differently. The heartache just isn’t worth it anymore. Belittling yourself for one more day just doesn’t make any sense. And more than that, you now realize no matter what you do or how you change, some people will never be pleased anyway. You now realize you have to start doing things for the right reasons! Not because it’s what you think everyone else needs, but because you finally know yourself to be worthy of your own love and care. Not because other people approve of you, but because you are breathing your own air, thinking your own thoughts, and occupying a space no one else ever could. Yes, you are indeed worthy! Your ideas are worthy. Your feelings are worthy. Your needs are worthy. And without everyone else’s constant validation, you must be who you are and live your truth. Even if it makes people turn their heads. Even if it means walking alone down the path less traveled for awhile… Even if your self-confidence has been shaken! The real battle is always in your mind. And your mind is under your control, not the other way around. You may have been broken down by adversity or rejection or stress, but YOU are not broken. So don’t let others convince you otherwise. And don’t let your mind get the best of you either. Heal yourself by refusing to belittle yourself. Choose to take up a lot of positive space in your own life today. Choose to give yourself permission to meet your own needs. Choose to honor your feelings and emotions. Choose to make self-love and self-care a part of your daily rituals… Choose to think better about yourself, so you can live better in spite of the challenges you face. When times are tough, and some piece of you is chipped and broken, it’s easy to feel like everything—ALL of you—is broken along with it. But that’s not true. We all have this picture in our minds of ourselves—this idea of what kind of person we are. When this idea gets even slightly harmed or threatened, we tend to react defensively and irrationally. People may question whether we did a good job, and this threatens our idea of being a competent person, so we become angry or hurt by the criticism. Someone falsely accuses us of something and this damages our idea that we’re a good person, and so we get angry and attack the other person, or we cower and cry. And the list goes on. But the craziest thing is, oftentimes we are actually the ones harming and threatening ourselves with negativity and false-accusations… Just this morning I was struggling to motivate myself to work on a new creative project I’ve been procrastinating on, so my identity of myself as someone who’s always productive and motivated and has great ideas suddenly came under attack. When I realized I wasn’t getting things done, it made me feel terribly self-conscious and upset because I began subconsciously worrying that I wasn’t who I thought I was. I felt like a slacker. My solution was to realize that I’m not just one thing. I’m not always productive—sometimes I am, but sometimes I’m unproductive too. I’m not always motivated—sometimes I am, but other times I’m a bit lazy. And obviously I don’t always have great ideas either, because that’s impossible. The truth is, I can be many things, and remembering this helps me stretch my identity so it’s not so fragile—so it doesn’t completely shatter when a small piece of it gets chipped. Then it doesn’t matter if someone occasionally thinks I didn’t do a good job, or if I sometimes catch myself not doing a good job… because I don’t always do a good job. I make mistakes. I am less than perfect. Just like YOU. And that’s perfectly OK. “Starting over is not an option!” Unfortunately that’s a lie many of us hold on to until the bitter end. The idea of starting over being a bad thing is baked right into the fabric of our society’s education system. We send our children to a university when they’re 17 or 18, and basically tell them to choose a career path they’ll be happy with for the next 40 years. “But, what if I choose wrong?” I remember thinking to myself. And that’s exactly what I did, in more ways than one. Over the years, however, through bouts of failure and hardship, I’ve learned the truth through experience: you can change paths anytime you want to, and oftentimes it’s absolutely necessary that you do. Yes, starting over and making substantial changes in your life is almost always feasible. It won’t be easy of course, but neither is being stuck with a lifelong career you naively chose when you were a teenager. And neither is holding on to something that’s not meant to be, or something that’s already long gone. The truth is, no one wins a game of chess by only moving forward; sometimes you have to move backward to put yourself in a position to win. And this is a perfect metaphor for life. Sometimes when it feels like you’re running into one dead end after another, it’s actually a sign that you’re not on the right path. Maybe you were meant to hang a left back when you took a right, and that’s perfectly fine. Life gradually teaches us that U-turns are allowed. So turn around when you must! There’s a big difference between giving up and starting over in the right direction. And there are three little words that can release you from your past mistakes and regrets, and get you back on track. These words are: “From now on…” So from now on, what should you do? Something that makes you feel like you’re making progress. Something small. As long as you don’t just sit in your seat, strapped down to a destiny that isn’t yours. If you mess it up, start over. Try something else. Let go and grow, day by day. It’s a practice of thinking better about the past and present, and then maintaining positive daily rituals so you can continue to evolve and fail forward. (Note: Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the Success chapter of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.) Eventually most of us end up settling in some part of our life. We let go of certain ideals and dreams, we compromise, and we make trade-offs. We gradually learn that we can’t have everything we want, because everything has an opportunity cost, and not every outcome in life can be perfectly controlled. But if we pay close attention we also learn that we can make the best of every outcome, and still get a lot of what we want in life, if we manage our energy appropriately. And these realizations collectively lead to an interesting question: When should you settle, or compromise, and when should you continue fighting hard for what you ideally want to achieve? There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, but when you encounter a situation that forces you to choose between compromise and fighting forward against the opposition, it might help to also ask yourself: “Do I really need this, or do I just kinda want it?” Being able to distinguish needs from wants is essential in every walk of life. Never let go of an outcome you truly need in your life, but be reasonably flexible on the outcomes you want but could live fine without. In other words, choose your battles wisely, and don’t let “perfect” become the enemy of a good life. Remind yourself that what you pay attention to grows. So focus on what really matters and let go of what does not. Don’t give up 60% of your life working 60-hour weeks at a day job that makes you absolutely miserable. Don’t abandon your sanity for the wrong reasons. Don’t neglect lifelong goals and dreams that have withstood the tests of time and still bring incredible meaning into your life. If you really need something, fight hard for it! But for everything else, let go a little. Loosen your grip, compromise… and settle. Settle on less of the unessential, to get more of what you really need in life. Discomfort can be a form of pain, but it isn’t a deep pain—it’s a shallow one. It’s the feeling you get when you’ve stepped outside of your comfort zone. The idea of exercising in many people’s minds, for example, brings discomfort, so they don’t do it. Eating a spinach and kale salad brings discomfort too. So does meditating, or writing in a journal, or focusing on a difficult task, or saying “no” to others. Of course these are just examples, because different people find discomfort in different things, but you get the gist. The key thing to understand is that most forms of discomfort actually help us grow into our strongest and smartest selves. However, many of us were raised by loving parents who did so much to make our childhoods comfortable, that we inadvertently grew up to subconsciously believe that we don’t need discomfort in our lives. So now we run from it constantly. The problem with this is that, by running from discomfort, we are constrained to partake in only the activities and opportunities within our comfort zones. And since our comfort zones are relativity small, we miss out on most of life’s greatest and healthiest experiences, and we get stuck in a debilitating cycle. Let’s use diet and exercise as an example… Amazingly, the simple act of accepting a little discomfort every day and taking it one small step at a time can solve most of our common problems, and make our minds happier, healthier, and stronger in the long run. But again, it’s hard sometimes—really, really hard! There is no person in the world capable of flawlessly handling every punch thrown at them. That’s not how we’re made. We’re made to get upset, sad, hurt, stumble and fall here and there. Because that’s part of living—to face discomfort, learn from it, and adapt over the course of time. This is what ultimately molds us into the person we become. So when you find yourself cocooned in isolation and cannot find your way out of the darkness, remember that this is similar to the place where caterpillars go to grow their wings. Just because today is uncomfortable and stressful, doesn’t mean tomorrow won’t be wonderful. You just got to get there. Goals are important—all journeys of change must begin with a goal. And you must also have determination in order to achieve your goals. However, what do you think happens when you are too determined, or too obsessed with a goal? You begin to nurture another belief: who you are right now is not good enough. Years ago I had become overly obsessive in my efforts to meditate. As my interest in meditation grew, I began to increasingly say to myself, “I’m not good enough yet,” and, “I have to be better at this.” And there was a ripple effect to that thought process. I gradually began to notice various imperfections within myself that needed to be “fixed.” My over-the-top efforts to meditate for extensive periods of time had opened the doors to lots of self-criticism and stress. Thankfully I caught myself and eventually realized that my obsession with “better” meditation had made me forget one of the core objectives of meditation—self-acceptance. So the bottom line is this: you have to accept yourself as you are, and then commit to personal growth. If you think you are absolutely “perfect” already, you will not make any positive efforts to grow. But constantly criticizing yourself is just as counterproductive as doing nothing, because you will never be able to build positive changes into your life when you’re obsessively distracted by your “flaws.” The key is to remind yourself that you already are good enough; you just need more practice. Change your mantra from, “I have to be better,” to “I will do my absolute best today.” The second mantra is far more effective because it actually prompts you to take positive action every day while simultaneously accepting the reality that every effort may not be perfect. Mindfulness as a daily ritual is the ultimate challenge and practice. It’s a way of living, of being, of seeing, of tapping into the full power of your humanity. Ready to get started? It’s simple, but not always easy. Practice… Ritualize this kind of mindfulness into your daily routines, and you will undoubtedly change the way you show up to the rest of your life. (Note: Our newest publication via Penguin Random House, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts and Reflections to Start Every Day”, is a great tool for daily mindfulness and self-reflection.) Happiness doesn’t always make us grateful, but gratitude usually helps us smile. Some may say that’s a cliché, but it’s not. Gratitude is foundational, and it’s always an easy practice. While being grateful seems simple enough, a grateful state of mind is unbelievably hard to maintain when life disappoints us. And that’s the kicker—when we’re feeling down and disappointed, that’s exactly when a dose of gratitude is most powerful. So what’s the best approach? Being grateful starts with being present. You can’t appreciate your life when you’re not paying attention to it. And the truth is, we make our present situations much worse when we aimlessly replay difficult past situations in our heads (“How could she possibly have done that to me?”), or when we ruminate over all the situations that might be problematic in the future (“What if he cheats on me?”). In the present moment, our real situation is rarely as convoluted as we make it out to be. And we can meet this moment with grace and gratitude, if we can truly stay in the present. Practice this in your life today. When your mind drifts into the past or speculates about the future, do your best to catch yourself, and then refocus mindfully back on the present. Practice loving exactly where you are, exactly what you are doing, and exactly who you are with, even as you work to move forward. Let this be a daily challenge you embrace: Love what you do, until you can do what you love. Love where you are, until you can be where you love. Love the people you’re with, until you can be with the people you love most. This is the way we find gratitude, opportunity, and peace on the average day. For Angel and me, working through life’s difficulties has grown significantly easier for us in recent times. Instead of focusing on how arduous everything is, we have ritualized the practice of gratitude into our lives, and we use our gratitude rituals to find hope, love, and joy in the small steps of progress we make every day. (Note: Angel and I build small, life-changing daily rituals like this with our students in the “Goals & Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy Course.) We all have the tendency to put ourselves at the center of the universe, and see everything from the viewpoint of how it affects us. And this can have all kinds of adverse effects, from feeling sorry for ourselves when things aren’t going exactly as planned, to doubting ourselves when we aren’t perfect, to feeling lost and alone with our issues when we’re having a bad day or going through hard times. So whenever I catch myself lingering at the center in an adverse state of mind, I do my best to briefly shift my focus away from my own issues, and onto other people around me that I might be able to help. Finding little ways to help others gets me out of my self-centered thinking, and then I’m not wallowing alone in self-pity anymore—I’m starting to think about what others need. I’m not doubting myself, because the question of whether I’m good enough is no longer the central question. The central question now is about what others need. Thus, thinking about others instead of oneself helps solve feelings self-consciousness and inadequacy, which in turn makes you feel a lot less broken and alone when you’re struggling to move your life forward. It’s one of life’s great paradoxes: when we serve others we end up benefiting as much if not more than those we serve. So whenever you feel a bit lost or stuck with your own issues, try to shift your focus from your circumstances to the circumstances of those around you. Instead of asking, “What’s wrong with me?” ask, “How can I help you?” Find someone who could use an extra hand and make a small, reasonable offer they can’t refuse. The perspective you gain from doing so will guide you forward. Angel and I initially developed this strategy in our lives about 15 years ago as we were struggling with the near simultaneous loss of two loved ones. It was really hard to find motivation when we didn’t think we had the strength to push forward—when we felt downright defeated and sorry for ourselves. But we took one small step every day—oftentimes just writing a short blog post to share some lessons learned with others who might find our stories and insights helpful—and it felt good, and we gradually got stronger. This morning, as I caught myself struggling with some inner conflicts, I followed suit again—I took a small step forward… just turning on my laptop, opening up a new document, and writing a single sentence. Such an action is so small as to seem insignificant, and yet so easy as to be possible when I was feeling down. And it showed me the next step was possible, and the next. And the end result is the blog post you’ve just finished reading. I sincerely hope you’ve benefited from it in some small way.

Remember this. On the average day happiness is letting go of what you assume life is supposed to be like, and sincerely appreciating it for everything it is. Over the past decade, as Marc and I have gradually worked with hundreds of our course students, coaching clients, and live event attendees, we’ve come to understand that the root cause of most human stress is simply our stubborn propensity to hold on to things. In a nutshell, we hold on tight to the hope that things will go exactly as we imagine, and then we complicate our lives to no end when they don’t. For example, there are a number of times when our minds cling to unhelpful ideals… In all of these common examples the mind holds on tight to something—an ideal—that isn’t real. And after awhile the inevitable happens—lots of unnecessary stress, anxiety, unhappiness, self-righteousness, self-hate, and depressive emotions ensue. So how can we stop holding on so tight? By realizing that there’s almost nothing to hold on to in the first place. Most of the things we desperately try to hold on to, as if they’re real, certain, solid, everlasting fixtures in our lives, aren’t really there. Or if they are there in some form, they’re changing, fluid, impermanent, or at least partially imagined in our minds. Life gets a lot easier to deal with when we remind ourselves of this and live accordingly. Today, let’s actively practice doing just that… As you read these words, you are breathing. Stop for a moment and notice this breath. You can control this breath, and make it faster or slower, or make it behave as you like. Or you can simply let yourself inhale and exhale naturally. There is peace in just letting your lungs breathe, without having to control the situation or do anything about it. Now imagine letting other parts of your body breathe, like your tense shoulders. Just let them be, without having to tense them or control them. Now look around the room you’re in and notice the objects around you. Pick one, and let it breathe. There are likely people in the room with you too, or in the same house or building, or in nearby houses or buildings. Visualize them in your mind, and let them breathe. When you let everything and everyone breathe, you just let them be, exactly as they are. You don’t need to control them, worry about them, or change them. You just let them breathe, in peace, and you accept them as they are. This is what letting go is all about. It can be a life-changing practice. Imagine you’re blindfolded and treading water in the center of a large swimming pool, and you’re struggling desperately to grab the edge of the pool that you think is nearby, but really it’s not—it’s far away. Trying to grab that imaginary edge is stressing you out, and tiring you out, as you splash around aimlessly trying to holding on to something that isn’t there. Now imagine you pause, take a deep breath, and realize that there’s nothing nearby to hold on to. Just water around you. You can continue to struggle with grabbing at something that doesn’t exist… or you can accept that there’s only water around you, and relax, and float. Truth be told, inner peace begins the moment you take a new breath and choose not to allow an uncontrollable event to dominate you in the present. You are not what happened to you. You are what you choose to become in this moment. Let go, breathe, and begin again. (Note: Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Adversity” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Many of the biggest misunderstandings in life could be avoided if we simply took the time to ask, “What else could this mean?” A wonderful way to do this is by using a reframing tool we initially picked up from research professor Brene Brown, which we then tailored through our coaching work with students and live event attendees. We call the tool The story I’m telling myself. Although asking the question itself—“What else could this mean?”—can help reframe our thoughts and broaden our perspectives, using the simple phrase The story I’m telling myself as a prefix to troubling thoughts has undoubtedly created many “aha moments” for our students and clients in recent times. Here’s how it works: The story I’m telling myself can be applied to any difficult life situation or circumstance in which a troubling thought is getting the best of you. For example, perhaps someone you love (husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, etc.) didn’t call you or text you when they said they would, and now an hour has passed and you’re feeling upset because you’re obviously not a high enough priority to them. When you catch yourself feeling this way, use the phrase: The story I’m telling myself is that they didn’t call me because I’m not a high enough priority to them. Then ask yourself these questions: Give yourself the space to think it all through carefully. Challenge yourself to think better on a daily basis—to challenge the stories you subconsciously tell yourself and do a reality check with a more objective mindset. (Note: Our newest publication via Penguin Random House, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts and Reflections to Start Every Day”, is a great tool for daily reality checks and perspective shifts.) Twenty years ago, when Marc and I were just undergrads in college, our psychology professor taught us a lesson we’ve never forgotten. On the last day of class before graduation, she walked up on stage to teach one final lesson, which she called “a vital lesson on the power of perspective and mindset.” As she raised a glass of water over her head, everyone expected her to mention the typical “glass half empty or glass half full” metaphor. Instead, with a smile on her face, our professor asked, “How heavy is this glass of water I’m holding?” Students shouted out answers ranging from a couple of ounces to a couple of pounds. After a few moments of fielding answers and nodding her head, she replied, “From my perspective, the absolute weight of this glass is irrelevant. It all depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for a minute or two, it’s fairly light. If I hold it for an hour straight, its weight might make my arm ache. If I hold it for a day straight, my arm will likely cramp up and feel completely numb and paralyzed, forcing me to drop the glass to the floor. In each case, the absolute weight of the glass doesn’t change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it feels to me.” As most of us students nodded our heads in agreement, she continued. “Your worries, frustrations, disappointments, and stressful thoughts are very much like this glass of water. Think about them for a little while and nothing drastic happens. Think about them a bit longer and you begin to feel noticeable pain. Think about them all day long, and you will feel completely numb and paralyzed, incapable of doing anything else until you drop them.” Think about how this relates to your life right now. If you’ve been struggling to cope with the weight of what’s on your mind today, it’s a strong sign that it’s time to put the figurative glass down. A big part of practicing letting go is gradually renewing your faith in yourself. This ‘renewed faith’ means finding the willingness to live with uncertainty, to feel your way through each day, to let your intuition guide you like a flashlight in the dark. It’s about standing firmly on your own two legs without the crutches you’ve been holding on to, and gradually taking small steps forward… And YOU ARE strong enough to take those steps! YOU’VE GOT THIS! So what if, for today, you choose to believe that you have enough and you are enough? What if, for today, you choose to believe that you are strong enough, wise enough, kind enough, and loved enough to take a positive step forward? What if, for today, you accepted people exactly as they are, and life exactly as it is? What if, as the sun sets on today, you choose to believe that the little bits of progress you made were more than enough for one day? And what if, tomorrow, you choose to believe it all over again? Practice making those choices. Practice letting go and renewing the faith you once had in both yourself and the world around you.

One Tragic Mistake Too Many People Make Every Single Day|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/one-tragic-mistake.jpg?resize=500%2C317&ssl=1| Busyness… is an illness. On a chilly January morning just inside the entryway to a Washington D.C. subway station, a young man took his violin out of its case and brought it up to his shoulder. He was dressed in regular clothes — just jeans and a t-shirt. And although he had a face many people found attractive, on this particular morning it was mostly obscured by a dark baseball cap and shaggy brown hair. After plucking the strings for a couple minutes to tune his instrument, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a few dollar bills, which he tossed into the violin case in front of him with the hopes that a few passers-by would do the same. It was a very active morning in the subway station as the young man began to play.  Thousands of people were busy hurrying to work, school, or wherever they were headed. Trains were coming and going — the morning rush was in full swing. Yet through all the busyness, the incredible sound of this young man’s violin filled the subway station. It was impossible to ignore. Or was it? Over the course of 43 minutes, more than 1,000 people walked through the doors of the subway entrance where Joshua Bell was playing. And if he was any other street performer, perhaps it would have been insignificant that he earned the attention of just a few people and just a small handful of change. But Joshua Bell wasn’t just any street performer. He was, and is, possibly the world’s most renowned violinist. And he was playing one of the most difficult classical masterpieces ever composed. And that masterpiece was being played on a $3,000,000 (yes, million) violin that emitted one of the most pure, eloquent sounds in the world. Yet almost nobody noticed. Why? Because he didn’t look like anyone special. And because everyone was way too busy hurrying to pause and notice the music.  Think about it… “I’m busy!” How often is that your excuse? It used to be my excuse every single day. Like those 1,000 people who ran past Joshua Bell’s music without a moment to spare, my schedule used to leave me zero time for unplanned presence and awareness. And I was proud of my busyness. I wore it like a badge! I wanted to remind everyone of how tough I had it. I wanted everyone to know how driving from place to place to place in my comfortable Honda was a huge pain in the butt. Not to mention how Angel and I would have to juggle business and family. Helping our course students and readers, and then immediately rushing out to buy and wrap birthday gifts? Don’t even get me started! And then only having an hour to get our son fed and bathed before bed each night, so we could get him to sleep and prepare to do it all over again… “Didn’t you hear me? I am super busy, everybody! Keep this in mind and have mercy on me! Please!” Yes, that’s exactly what I used to want you to know about me…. But not anymore. Now I actually pause to hear the music. And I’m proud of it. Here’s the thing: Busyness is NOT a badge of honor. There’s no honor at all in senseless and endless busyness. And most busyness on the average day is just a tragic mistake that makes life overwhelming. If we’re not below the poverty line, juggling three jobs at once just to put food on the table, then our busyness is self-inflicted 98% of the time (the exception being that 2% of the time when truly difficult life events blindside us). I finally got a handle on my busyness when I studied it long enough to realize that, yes… my busyness was within my control. In fact, most of the time I actually created hurry and worry where none actually existed. On any normal weekday, you would have found me running around begging family, business associates, and basically everyone nearby to move faster… “If you don’t finish eating, we’re going to be late!” “If we don’t get this task done in the next 10 minutes… we’re never going to hit our target!” The funny thing is, whether I provoked everyone around me to move faster or not, we always collectively moved at about the same pace anyway. But when I provoked them, everyone (including myself) was unhappier and more stressed out. It became crystal clear to me that nearly all of my busyness was an overreaction in my head. I was manufacturing it in hopes that it would create urgency in others, and somehow make my life easier. Instead it did the exact opposite — my busyness only created anxiety, bitterness and complexity. And even on days when the busyness was real (lots of things to do), it was typically due to an overbooked schedule I had personally created. All of this got me thinking: Why in the world am I voluntarily making my life harder, busier, and unhappier than it has to be? Sadly, a big part of the reason we fill our lives with constant busyness has to do with the always-plugged-in, always-connected, always-sharing, always-comparing society we live in. We subconsciously default to defining ourselves based on where we are and what we have in relation to everyone else. If we don’t have a “better” career, house, car, or pair of shoes, we feel inferior. And the only way we can possibly do better and level up, is to be busier doing… whatever! After all, we are what we do, right? Job title, employer, etc. — aren’t these typically the first things we share with strangers we meet at parties? We fill our social media feeds and our calendars with manufactured and airbrushed busyness to make ourselves feel special or more important than average. But in the process, we not only miss out on the serenity and beauty that exists within ourselves, but we also miss out on experiencing that same serenity and beauty in the world around us, because our busyness has buried it with “hurry” and “worry,” and the endless need to be somewhere else, doing something else, as fast as feasibly possible. Ready for a positive change in your life? Join Angel and me… Let’s wake-up every morning together and begin our days mindfully with some quiet journaling and self-reflection. Let’s start making our days less busy and more beneficial. Let’s start keeping our lives ordered and our schedules under-booked. Let’s start creating a foundation with a soft place to land, a wide margin for error, and room to think and breathe. So we can pause to hear the music, and smile, when the opportunity arises. Before you go, please leave Angel and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay. Your feedback is important to us. 🙂 How has senseless busyness affected your life?

Photo by: emil mk 20 Little Things to Remember When Rejection Hurts|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/20-rejection-hurts.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| Be OK with walking away. Rejection teaches you how to reject what’s not right for you. As you look back on your life, you will realize that many of the times you thought you were being rejected by someone or from something you wanted, you were in fact being redirected to someone or something you needed. Seeing this when you’re in the midst of feeling rejected, however, is quite tough. I know because I’ve been there… As soon as someone critiques, criticizes, and pushes you away — as soon as you are rejected — you find yourself thinking, “Well, that proves once again that I’m not worthy.” What you need to realize is, the other person or situation is not worthy of you and your particular journey. Rejection is oftentimes necessary medicine; it teaches you how to reject relationships and opportunities that aren’t going to work, so that you can find the right ones that will. It doesn’t mean you aren’t good enough; it just means someone else failed to notice what you have to offer. Which means you now have more time to improve yourself and explore your options. Will you be bitter for a moment? Absolutely. Hurt? Of course — you’re human. There isn’t a soul on this planet that doesn’t feel a small fraction of their heart break at the realization of rejection. For a short time afterward you will ask yourself every question you can think of: But then you have to let your emotions fuel you in a positive way. This is the important part. Let your feelings of rejection drive you, feed you, and inspire one heck of a powerful opening to the next chapter of your story. Honestly, if you constantly feel like someone is not treating you with respect, check your price tag. Perhaps you’ve subconsciously marked yourself down. Because it’s you who gradually tells others what you’re worth by showing them what you’re willing to accept for your time and attention on a daily basis. So get off the clearance rack! And I mean right NOW! If you don’t value and respect yourself, wholeheartedly, no one else likely will either. I know it’s hard to accept, but think about it: All too often we let the rejections of our past dictate every move we make thereafter. We literally do not know ourselves to be any better than what some intolerant person or some isolated circumstance once told us was true. It’s time to realize this and squash the subconscious idea that you don’t deserve any better. It’s time to remind yourself that… The person you liked, loved or respected in the past, who treated you like dirt again and again, probably has nothing intellectually or spiritually to offer you in the present moment, but more headaches and heartache. One of the most rewarding and important moments in life is when you finally find the strength and courage to let go of what you can’t change, like someone else’s behavior or decisions. It’s not the end of the world — it’s never the end of the world — and yet rejection can make the loss of someone or something you weren’t even that crazy about feel gut-wrenching and world-ending. There’s a time and place for everything, and every step is necessary. You will never miss out on what is truly meant for you, even if it has to come to you in a roundabout way. So stay focused and be positive about the next step. Just keep doing your best right now, and don’t force what’s not yet supposed to fit into your life. Life ebbs and flows, and sometimes you have to get knocked down lower than you have ever been to stand up taller and emotionally stronger than you ever were before. (Note: Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Adversity” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) When you lose someone or something, try not to think of it as a loss, but as a gift that lightens your load so that you can better travel the path meant for you. Life and God both have greater plans for you that don’t involve crying at night or believing that you’re broken. You are not! Eventually you will end up where you need to be, doing the right things, alongside the right people. Patience is the key. And remember, patience is not about waiting, it’s the ability to maintain a positive outlook right now while you gradually move forward to explore the opportunities in front of you. Sometimes people don’t notice the things we do for them until we stop doing them. And sometimes the more chances you give, the more respect you lose. Enough is enough! Perhaps it’s not rejection that’s the problem, but the fact that your boundaries were set too low. Never let people get comfortable with disrespecting you. You deserve better. You deserve to be with those who make you smile, those who don’t take you for granted, those who don’t constantly leave you hanging. Some chapters in our lives have to close without closure. There’s no point in losing yourself by trying to fix what’s meant to stay broken. Inner peace begins the moment you take a deep breath and choose not to allow another person or event to dominate your thoughts. You are not what happened to you. You are what you choose to become in this moment. Let go, breathe, and begin again right now. You really can’t take things other people say about you too personally. Most of what they think and say is a reflection of them, not of you. And remember that you simply don’t need to attend every argument you’re invited to, especially when your sense of self-worth is on the line. Naysayers’ rejections aren’t that important in the grand scheme of things, because most of them don’t even know you that well. So don’t let their opinions conquer you. Seriously, most of us do not understand how much potential we have — we limit ourselves to the level someone else told us was possible. Philosophically, some people are always going to throw bricks at others, and those with the strength to succeed in the long run are usually the ones who build themselves up with the bricks others have thrown at them. Let your scars remind you that the surface level damage someone has inflicted on you has left you smarter and more resilient. When you look back on those scars, don’t think of the pain you felt; think of the strength you gained, and appreciate how far you’ve come. You’ve been through a lot, but you’ve grown a lot too. Give yourself credit for your resilience and step forward again with grace. Too many people overvalue what they are not and undervalue what they are. Don’t be one of them. Dare to be yourself — your best and unique self — however awkward, different, or odd that self may prove to be to someone else. Comparing your situation too closely with others, or other people’s perceptions, only undermines your worth, your education, and your own inner wisdom. No one can handle your present situation better than you. The more we fill our lives with genuine passion and purpose, the less time and energy we waste looking for approval from everyone else. You can use your struggles, frustrations, and rejections to motivate you rather than annoy you. Yes, you are in control of the way you look at life. (Note: Journaling is a great tool for fostering this kind of perspective shift — see our newest publication via Penguin Random House, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts & Reflections to Start Every Day”.) You may not be responsible for everything that happened to you in the past, or everything that’s happening to you right now, but you need to be responsible for undoing the thinking and behavioral patterns these uncontrollable circumstances try to create within you. So breathe deep and remind yourself that the most practical changes happen when you choose to take control of what you do have power over, instead of craving control of what you don’t. Again, it’s about letting go. Because you usually can’t calm the storm — what you can do is calm yourself and the storm will eventually pass. Be strong enough to let go today, wise enough to move forward, diligent enough to work hard, and patient enough to wait for what you deserve. Practice accepting the fact that things will never again be what they once were, and that this ending is really an evolution, an transition… a new beginning that’s starting now. Yes, it’s your turn to be a daily beacon of hope to yourself — to remind yourself that your worth isn’t contingent on other people’s acceptance of you. You’re allowed to be yourself. You’re allowed to make mistakes. You’re allowed to voice your thoughts and feelings. You’re allowed to assert your needs and enforce your boundaries. You’re allowed to hold on to the truth that who you are is more than enough. And you’re allowed to let go of situations in your life that obviously weren’t meant to be. But before you go we would love to hear from YOU. Which point mentioned above resonates with you the most right now?

Why do we get so easily stressed out and sucked into drama? It’s because the world isn’t the predictable, orderly, blissful place we’d like it to be. We want things to be easy, comfortable and well ordered. Unfortunately, work is hectic, relationships are challenging, people demand our time, we aren’t as prepared as we’d like to be, our family frustrates us, and there’s just too much to do and learn and process in our minds. So we get stressed out, and drama ensues. But the problem isn’t the world, or other people’s thoughts and behavior – these aspects of life will always be uncontrollable and a bit of a mess. The problem is that we’re holding on too tightly to ideals that don’t match reality. We have subconsciously set up expectations in our minds of what we want other people to be, what we want ourselves to be, and what our work and relationships and life “should” be like. Our attachment to our ideals stirs anxiety in our minds and stress in our lives. Our resistance to accept things as they are fuels our drama. And we don’t want to be a part of this drama – at least that’s what we tell ourselves – so we blame others for it … which in turn creates even more of it. But there’s good news! We can let go of drama, and find peace with reality. I’m going to suggest a simple practice for whenever you feel stress, frustration, worry, and all the other detrimental mindsets that bring drama into your life. Ready? Focus, carefully, on what you’re feeling. Don’t numb it with distractions, but instead bring it further into your awareness. Turn to it, and welcome it. Smile, and give what you feel your full, thoughtful attention. Notice the feeling in your body. Where is the feeling situated, and what unique qualities does it have? Notice the tension in your body, and also in your mind, that arises from this feeling. Try relaxing the tense parts of your body. Then relax the tense parts of your mind. Do so by focusing on your breath: Close your eyes, breathe in and feel it, breathe out and feel it, again and again, until you feel more relaxed. In this more relaxed state, find some quiet space within yourself. And in this space… Take a moment and just sit with the inner peace these two simple rediscoveries bring. This is the practice of letting go of drama, and simply accepting this moment as it is, and yourself as you are. You can do this anytime, wherever you are. You can practice focusing on the goodness in others as well. Seeing the goodness in your challenges and relationships and work, and so forth. You can stop the drama, and rediscover the peace and joy and love that are always close by. Since I’m only human, just like you, I still engage in drama when I’m in the heat of the moment sometimes. So I’ve implemented a simple strategy to support the practice I’ve outlined above. In a nutshell, I proactively remind myself NOT to create or engage in drama. Anytime I catch myself doing so, I pause and read the following mantras to myself (I keep them on my phone). Then I take some fresh deep breaths, and begin my practice… How has needless drama affected you and your relationships? Do you have any thoughts or insights to share? We would love to hear from you.

What will matter is how you lived, how you loved, and what you learned along the way. Deep down you know this already, right? Yet today, just like the majority of us, you are easily distracted and derailed by the insignificant. You give too much of your time to meaningless time-wasters. You step through days, skeptically, with inner resistance. You take your important relationships for granted. You get caught up in hurtful drama. You give in to your doubts. And the list goes on. But why? Why do you follow these hurtful patterns of behavior? Why do you set yourself up for regret when you know better? Because you’re human, and human beings are imperfect creatures that make misjudgments constantly. We get caught up in our own heads, and literally don’t know our lives to be any better than the few things that aren’t going our way. And as our minds subconsciously dwell on these things, we try to distract ourselves to numb the tension we feel. But by doing so, we also distract ourselves from what matters most. We scrutinize and dramatize the petty annoyances in our lives until we’re blue in the face, and then we sit back and scratch our heads in bewilderment of how unfulfilling and empty life feels. But the older we grow, the more focused we tend to become, and the less pointless drama, distraction and busyness we engage in. Life humbles us gradually as we age. We begin to realize just how much nonsense we’ve wasted time on. And we begin to adjust our focus toward what’s truly important. Are you ready to adjust your focus? Today, I challenge you to be an old soul—to adjust your focus sooner rather than later . . . to dodge the avoidable regret and stress on the horizon. How? There are many approaches, but let’s start by learning from other people’s stories . . . Over the past decade, via our blog, Getting Back to Happy Course, private coaching, side projects, and live annual conferences (2022 tickets are available now), Angel and I have been blessed by the amazing stories that people around the world have shared with us. And right now, with full permission from the original sources, I want to share powerful snippets from sixteen of these stories with you. These are super short but incredibly focused accounts of life, decision-making, and the subtle regrets that sneak up on us along the way. There’s definitely something for all of us to learn (or re-learn) here: I hope the stories above made you think about how to improve your approach in certain life situations. But, perhaps some of them also reminded you of how you’re falling short. If it’s the latter, I want you to take a deep breath right now. Remember that you don’t have to be defined by the things you did or didn’t do in the past. Don’t let yourself be controlled by regret. Maybe there’s something you could have done differently, or maybe not. Either way, it’s merely something that’s already happened. Do your best to cleanse your heart and mind. How? With focused presence and appreciation. Just this morning, for example, after coming to terms with a regretful business decision I recently made, and after writing my heart out for an hour, I went for a long jog at the beach . . . sea foam kissing my feet with each step, white sand footprints behind me, and the morning sky bursting with bright colors overhead. At the end of my jog I turned toward the ocean and took several deep breaths, mostly because the sky, and the Atlantic, had momentarily taken my breath away. I stood there on the sand and applauded. Yes, I literally clapped my hands in recognition. Because this is the only response life truly deserves: a fully present, appreciative applause. Today, wherever you are, whatever regrets or circumstances you’re dealing with, take a moment to really appreciate this gift we call life, and applaud. Then do your best to give back to life. Do something—anything—to show your gratitude for this imperfect miracle you’ve been given. Be kind to a stranger, create something others can use, be loving to your family . . . make a small difference in your own unique way. And see how it feels. Before you go, let me ask you a quick question: And how might reminding yourself of it, daily, change your life? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts. Also, our next annual Think Better, Live Better conference is taking place May 28-29, 2022 in Orlando. Eight discounted early bird tickets are still available today (while they last). One Hard Thing Mentally Strong People Do When Life Doesn’t Go as Planned|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/one-hard-thing-mentally-strong.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| It’s wild how we outgrow what we once thought we couldn’t live without, and then we fall in love with what we didn’t even know we wanted. Life keeps leading us down paths we would never travel if it were up to us. Don’t be afraid. Have faith. Trust the journey. Don’t let your expectations of how life “should be” blind you to the beauty of the life you’re living. And of course, if you’re struggling with trusting the journey and taming your expectations right now, know that you are not alone. Many of us are here with you, working hard to let go, find more presence and acceptance, and get our thinking back on track. Let me share a quick metaphor with you that I often share with our course students and live event attendees (2022 tickets available now)… Imagine you had a ripe, juicy tangerine sitting on the table in front of you. You pick it up eagerly, take a bite and begin to taste it. You already know how a ripe, juicy tangerine should taste, and so when this one is a bit tarter than expected, you make a face, feel a sense of disappointment and swallow it, feeling cheated out of the experience you expected. Or perhaps the tangerine tastes completely normal—nothing special at all. So, you swallow it without even pausing to appreciate its flavor, as you move on to the next unworthy bite, and the next. In the first scenario, the tangerine let you down because it didn’t meet your expectations. In the second, it was too plain because it met your expectations to a T. Do you see the irony here? It’s either not good, or not good enough. This is how many of us live our lives… unhappily. It’s why so many of us feel let down, disappointed, and unexcited about almost everything. Because nothing really meets our expectations. Now, imagine you try this instead: remove your expectations of how the tangerine “should” taste. You don’t know, and you don’t expect to know, because you haven’t even tried it yet. Instead, you’re genuinely curious, impartial and open to a variety of possible flavors. You taste it, and you truly pay attention. You notice the juiciness, the texture of the pulp, the simultaneously tangy, tart and sweet flavors swirling around on your tongue, and all the other complex sensations that arise in your awareness as you chew. You didn’t know how this tangerine would taste, but now you realize it’s different than the rest, and it’s remarkable in its own way. It’s a totally new experience—a worthwhile experience—because you’ve never tasted THIS tangerine before. Mindfulness experts often refer to this as “beginner’s mind,” but really, it’s just the result of a mindset free of needless, stifling expectations. The tangerine, of course, can be substituted for almost anything in your life: any event, any situation, any relationship, any person, any thought at all that enters your mind. If you approach any of these with expectations of “how it should be” or “how it has to be” in order to be good enough for you, they will almost always disappoint you in some way… or be too plain and unexciting to even remember. And you’ll just move on to the next disappointment or unworthy life experience, and the next, and the next, and so on and so forth… Until you’ve lived the vast majority of your life stuck in an endless cycle of experiences you barely like or barely even notice. When you add up over a decade worth of one-on-one coaching sessions with students, private coaching clients, and the annual live events we host, Marc and I have lots of experience when it comes to assisting people through the pain points that have been holding them back. And one of the most prevalent pain points we’ve seen unfold over the years is what I just described above—expectations gone wrong. In fact, most of what we describe as our “biggest problems” are the direct consequence of how we react to life on an average day. Yes, sometimes there are major tragedies to cope with, but most of the time the only real tragedy is our weak thinking and resulting behavior in the present moment. Exercising your mental strength—your inner resilience—is key! And you don’t have to be born mentally strong either. You can develop this vital character trait with daily practice. Is it easy? Not exactly. Is it worth it? Absolutely! And it all starts with facing the present moment fully, with genuine presence and acceptance. Even when times are relatively good, one of the hardest challenges we face in life is to simply live in our own skin—to just be right here, right now, regardless of where we are. Too often we aimlessly distract ourselves with anything and everything: food, booze, shopping, television, gossip news, social networks, video games, smart phones, iPads, etc.—basically anything to keep us from being fully present. We use compulsive work, compulsive exercise, compulsive love affairs, and the like, to escape from ourselves and the realities of living with full presence. In fact, many of us will go to great lengths to avoid the feeling of being alone with ourselves in an undistracted environment. So, we succumb to hanging out with just about anybody to avoid the feeling of solitude. For being alone means dealing with our true feelings: fears, anxieties, anticipation, uncertainty, frustrations, envy, disappointment, and so on and so forth. And when harder times hit, things spiral even further out of control. On the flip side, mentally strong people gradually grow to understand that finding peace and happiness in life does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, no challenges, and no hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things while remaining focused in your mind and calm in your heart. It’s about letting go of the pictures in your head about how things were “supposed to be,” and facing the present moment’s challenges with presence and poise. So, begin today by just noticing with curiosity, and without judgment, all of the ways in which you avoid being in your own skin, with your own issues, right here, right now, in this present moment we call life. Then focus, carefully, on what you’re truly feeling. Don’t numb yourself with any more distractions, but instead bring how you feel further into your awareness. Turn to it, and welcome it. Smile, and give what you feel your full, thoughtful attention. Try relaxing the tense parts of your body. Then relax the tense parts of your mind. Do so by focusing on your breath: Close your eyes, breathe in and feel it, breathe out and feel it, again and again, until you feel more relaxed. In this more relaxed state, find some quiet space within yourself. And in this space… Take time to just sit with the inner peace these simple rediscoveries bring. This is the practice of letting go of stress, and simply accepting this moment as it is, and yourself as you are. You can do this anytime, wherever you are. You can practice focusing on the goodness in others as well. Seeing the goodness in your challenges and relationships and work, even when things don’t go exactly as planned. You can build a healthy daily ritual of stopping unnecessary stress in your life, and rediscovering the peace and joy and love that are always just a few thoughts away. (Note: Marc and I build healthy, life-changing daily rituals like this with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy Course and in our NYT bestselling book.) Don’t wish away any more time waiting for better times ahead. Just appreciate where you are. You’ve come a long way, and you’re still learning and growing. Be thankful for the lessons. Take them and make the best of things right now. And if you’re up to it, we’d love know: Please leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

"10 Powerful Mantras to Stop You from Judging People|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-let-go-judging-mantras.jpg?resize=500%2C324&ssl=1| When we are judging everyone and everything, we are learning nothing. One of the most incredible changes I’ve made in my life, which has undoubtedly made me a happier person and a better friend, is learning to let go of judging people. Now, I’m not going to sit here and pretend that I don’t ever judge others – we all have a tendency to do so by default… it’s a human instinct, and I’m not the exception. But I have learned to catch myself, and to recognize how judging is harmful. Notice I say “harmful” instead of “bad,” because instead of judging myself, I’d rather observe that the act of judging causes harm. What underlying harmful conditions are indicated by my tendency to judge people? It varies, but in many cases these points apply… Let me give you a personal example of how judging someone plays out so we can see how the harmful conditions above transpire: I visit an old friend who is actively neglecting his own health – he is overweight and has extremely high blood pressure, and yet he eats junk food every day and never exercises. I know he can improve his health by changing his daily decisions. So I judge him for what he’s doing, get irritated with him, indirectly insult him with my opinionated commentary, and then dismiss him when our conversation turns sour. This kind of situation occurs all the time in relationships all around the world – just tweak the details a little and then substitute my old friend for someone’s husband, wife, father, mother, colleague, friend, etc. Now, lets take a closer look at what’s really going on in my situation… First of all, I’m a bit ignorant of what my old friend is going through, as I don’t fully understand his point of view. The truth is, he has been deeply depressed about his poor health, feeling ugly, unwanted, scared, and untrusting of himself to make better decisions. Because of his depression, he desperately tries to avoid thinking about anything related to his health, and therefore makes himself feel better through snack food, binge-watching TV shows, and other unhealthy distractions. He’s just trying to cope. And in fact, I have done similar things many times in the past… I have failed. I have dealt with hardship. I have felt depressed. And I have comforted myself in unhealthy ways. So I’m not really any better than him, even if I believe I am. What’s more, I’m being ungrateful for the amazing human being he is, despite his health issues. He truly is wonderful – which is precisely why I’m friends with him – but by judging him, I’m not appreciating him at all. Instead, I’m being self-absorbed by focusing on how much “better” I am, how I think he “should” be, how he’s irritating me, how my irritation is more important than all the pain he’s feeling inside. I’m not being curious about what’s really happening in his heart and mind, and what he’s going through and why. Instead, I have simply judged him. And from this position of close-minded judgment, I can’t help because I have stopped communicating effectively, and have dismissed him as unworthy of my effort. First and foremost, you must bring awareness to the fact that you’re doing it. Doing so takes practice, but there are two crystal-clear signs of judging to look for in yourself: After you catch yourself judging, pause and take a deep breath. Don’t berate yourself, but simply ask yourself a few questions: Once you’ve done that, offer your kindness and compassion. Perhaps they just need someone to hear them, someone to not judge them, someone to not control them, someone to be present without an agenda… But in any case, remind yourself that you can’t help them at all from a position of judgment. And you can’t help yourself either… because judging people is stressful. Since I intellectually understand everything I’ve discussed above, but often forget when I’m in the heat of the moment, I’ve implemented a unique strategy to help me stop judging people. In a nutshell, I proactively remind myself NOT to judge. Anytime I’m heading into a social situation where I feel the itch of judgment stirring inside me, I read the following mantras to myself before I leave the house… How has judging people affected you and your relationships? Do you have any thoughts or insights to share? We would love to hear from you. Please leave a reply below.

When life is pressing on you and stressing you out, pause, take a deep breath, and remind yourself that you are not at the center of the universe. When you’re overwhelmed by life’s daily struggles, it’s so easy to feel like you’re at the center. But you aren’t. None of us are. Truth be told, we all have the occasional tendency to put ourselves at the center, and see everything in life from the viewpoint of how it affects us. This can have all kinds of unfavorable effects, from feeling sorry for ourselves when things don’t go exactly as planned, to doubting ourselves when we fail to be perfect. Let me give you a recent example from my life… This morning I was faced with a painful rejection – an opportunity I applied for was not decided in my favor. At first I felt awful – I felt a familiar feeling of inadequacy. But I caught myself and quickly shifted my focus. Instead of ruminating over my disappointment, I thought about other people I might help – I thought about writing a new article on www.marcandangel.com. Finding little ways to help others snaps me out of my self-centered thinking, and then I’m not wallowing in self-pity anymore – I’m starting to think about what others need. I’m not second-guessing myself, because the question of whether I’m inadequate or not is no longer the central question. The central question now is about how I can give back. And writing on www.marcandangel.com is my go-to way of giving back. The bottom line is that finding a way to give back – to practice a little kindness and generosity – made a big difference in my life this morning. And it can make a big difference in your life too. Over the past decade, via our blog, Getting Back to Happy course, live events, and side projects, Angel and I have been blessed by the beautiful stories that people around the world have shared with us. Angel shared some of these stories with you in her most recent blog post. And right now (with full permission from the original sources), I want to follow Angel’s lead and share twelve more of these stories with you. The stories (or inspiring story snippets) I’ve selected here are super short but incredibly powerful accounts of generosity. I hope they inspire you to shift your focus and give back in your own unique way today… This morning, after receiving the rejection I mentioned, and after writing my heart out for an hour, I went for a long jog at the beach… sea foam kissing my feet with each step, white sand footprints behind me, and the morning sky bursting with bright colors overhead. At the end of my jog I turned toward the ocean and took several deep breaths, mostly because the sky, and the Atlantic, had momentarily taken my breath away. I stood there on the sand and applauded. Yes, I literally clapped my hands in recognition. Because this is the only response life truly deserves: an appreciative applause. Today, wherever you are, whatever circumstances you’re dealing with, take a moment to really appreciate this gift we call life, and applaud. Then do your best to give back to life. Do something – anything – to show your gratitude for this imperfect miracle you’ve been given. Be kind to a stranger, create something others can use, be loving to your family… make a difference in your own unique way. Let your appreciation fuel your kindness and generosity. And let doing so change your life. If you’re feeling up to it, I would love to hear from YOU. In a few short sentences, please leave a comment below and tell me how kindness and generosity have affected your life. What is your story?

They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. I don’t think anything could be closer to the truth, and yet all too often we find ways of complicating things for ourselves. We look for happiness where it does not exist – in shallow goals and desires – in possessions, quick thrills, and impressing the wrong people. Angel and I were recently reminded of this when we met a family of six staying at a hotel in near our home. We saw them hanging around outside the lobby, sharing stories and laughing hysterically. As we walked by, Angel and I said hello to them and asked where they were from. “Oh, we’re from here,” the mother said. “Our house burned down to the ground yesterday, but miraculously, all of us made it out safely. And that makes today a day worth smiling about.” Talk about a wake-up call. Some people might say they had lost everything, and yet this family knew better – they knew they had it all. Because there really is nothing like joyful tears and deep breaths after a long, hard laugh with the people you love – nothing in the whole world like a sore stomach for the right reasons and a grateful heart to back it up. That’s a situation where true happiness is surely found. And there are many other sources of true happiness as well. But as I’ve said, there are also lots of common traps – goals and desires that we think will bring us happiness, but actually do the exact opposite. Recognizing these traps is the key. In fact, I believe one of the best feelings comes when you realize that you can be perfectly happy without the things you once thought you needed. With this in mind, consider the ten goals and desires (traps) below and how they may be holding you back. Each of them is popular in our culture, and thus common in our lives, but rather than contributing to our happiness, they rob us of it. So say it out loud with me: “To be happier, I do NOT need…” And let me leave you with this to think about: According to a recent scientific study published in the Journal of Research in Personality, overall levels of happiness decline from one’s teens until one’s 40s and then pick up again until they peak in one’s early 70s. So the chances are that your happiest days are yet to come. Hopefully that gives you something to smile about today. Just keep doing your best by taking life moment by moment, complaining very little, and being grateful for the little things that mean a lot. So, which of the points in this post do you resonate with the most? What do you sometimes forget you do NOT need to be happier in life? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts and insights.

"8 Wake-Up Calls You Need to Receive in Life Before it’s Too Late|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/8-wake-up-calls-too-late.jpg?resize=500%2C331&ssl=1| You’ve come a long way, and you’re still learning and growing. Be thankful for the lessons. Take them and make the best of things right now. For my 18th birthday, many moons ago, my grandfather on my mom’s side gave me four lightly-used flannel shirts that he no longer needed. The shirts were barely worn and in great shape; my grandfather told me he thought they would look great on me. Unfortunately, I thought they were odd gifts at the time and I wasn’t thankful. I looked at him skeptically, gave him a crooked half-smile, and moved on to the other gifts sitting in front of me. My grandfather died two days later from a sudden heart attack. The flannel shirts were the last gifts he ever gave me, and that crooked half-smile was the last time I directly acknowledged him. Today, I still regret the little thing I didn’t say when I had the chance: “Thank you Grandpa. I appreciate you.” That was a huge wake-up call for me — one that has served me well for over two decades now. And here are eight wake-up calls for YOU — some important life lessons worth learning before it’s too late: About 15 years ago a coworker of mine died in a car accident on the way to work. During his funeral several people from the office were in tears, saying kind things like: “I loved him. We all loved him so much. He was such a wonderful person.” I started crying too, and I wondered if these people had told him that they loved him while he was alive, or whether it was only with death that this powerful word, love, had been used without question or hesitation. I vowed to myself then and there that I would never again hesitate to speak up to the people I love and remind them of how much I appreciate them. They deserve to know they give meaning to my life. They deserve to know I think the world of them. Bottom line: If you love someone today, tell them. If you appreciate someone today, tell them. There might not be a tomorrow. Today is the day to express your love and admiration. (Note: Angel and I discuss this in detail in the Relationships chapter of our book, “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.) You will never know exactly what another person is going through or what their whole story is. When you believe you do, realize that your assumptions about their life are in direct relation to your own limited perspective. Many people you believe to be successful are extremely unhappy. Many people you think have it easy have worked their tail off to achieve their status. Many people who appear to be wealthy are in debt because of their extravagant tastes for material possessions. Many people who appear to be too old and uncool were once every bit as young and hip and inexperienced as you are right now. It’s not the mistakes and failures you have to worry about the most, it’s the opportunities you miss when you don’t even try that hurt the worst. Trying — truly trying — always leads to some level of success, regardless of the outcome. Even mistakes and failures teach you what not to do next time. Every outcome, good or bad, is a lesson that makes you stronger and wiser over time. So keep reminding yourself that in the end there’s only one thing that makes a goal or dream impossible to achieve: the failure to try. Because the results you achieve in life are NOT based on what you plan to do or what you say you’ll do. Your results come from what you actually try and do consistently! Yes, your life will get better when YOU get better. Start investing in yourself mentally and physically. Make it a priority to learn and grow a little bit every day by building positive rituals and sticking to them. The stronger you grow and become, the better your life will feel in the long run. Patience involves productive activity. It means doing your very best with the resources available to you, while understanding that the results you seek are worth the required time and effort, and not available elsewhere for any less time and effort. Patience is the realization that the quality of your life in the long run is much more significant than the quantity of things you fill it with today. Patience is your willingness to accept and appreciate what you have right now, while you gradually work hard for the dreams and goals that matter most to you. Intuitively, you already know that the best stuff in life isn’t stuff at all, and that relationships, experiences, and meaningful work are the staples of a happy life. Yet you live in a consumer driven society where your mind is incessantly subjected to clever advertising ploys that drive you, against your better judgment, to buy material goods you don’t need or even want. And at a certain point, the excessive material objects you buy end up hurting the emotional needs advertisers would like you to believe they are meant to support. So next time you’re getting ready to make an impulsive purchase, ask yourself if this thing is really better than the things you already have. Or have you been momentarily tricked into believing that you’re dissatisfied with what you already have? (Read Soulful Simplicity.) All humans are imperfect. At times, the confident lose confidence, the patient misplace their patience, the generous act selfish, and the knowledgeable second guess what they know. And guess what? You’re human — we all are. We make mistakes, we lose our tempers, and we get caught off guard. We stumble, we slip, and we spin out of control sometimes. But that’s the worst of it; we all have our moments. Most of the time we are remarkable. So stand beside the people you love through their trying times of imperfection, and offer yourself the same courtesy; if you aren’t willing to, you don’t deserve to be around for the remarkable moments either. Life isn’t about a single moment of great triumph and attainment. It’s about the trials and errors that get you there — the blood, sweat, and tears — the small, inconsequential things you do every day. It all matters in the end — every step, every regret, every decision, and every little affliction. Yes, the seemingly useless happenings add up to something. The minimum wage job you had in high school. The evenings you spent laughing and socializing with coworkers you never see anymore. The hours you spent writing down your thoughts on social media posts no one ever read. Contemplations about elaborate future plans that never came to be. All those lonely nights spent reading novels and news columns and Twitter threads and fashion tips and questioning your own principles on life and sex and religion and whether or not you’re good enough just the way you are! All of this has strengthened you! All of this has led you to every success you’ve ever had. All of this has made you who you are today. Truth be told, you’ve been broken down dozens of times and put yourself back together again. Think about how remarkable that is, and how far you have come. You’re not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or even yesterday. You’re always growing… stronger! Just because someone else can, doesn’t mean you can, right? Because you’re not good enough, or you’ve already missed your chance, or it’s just not in the cards for you. You look for reasons they can do it but you can’t… OK fine, it’s easy to find excuses: but look at all the other people who also have considerable obstacles and have done it anyway. Angel and I have a family, and have coped with significant loss in our lives, and still managed to make meaningful progress in our lives. And just as we’ve turned things around for ourselves, we know hundreds of other people who’ve done the same. Through nearly 15 years of work with our students and our coaching clients, we’ve witnessed people reinventing themselves at all ages — 48-year olds starting healthy families, 57-year-olds graduating from college for the first time, 71-year-olds starting successful businesses, and so forth. And stories abound of people with disabilities or illnesses who overcame their obstacles to achieve incredible outcomes. No one else can succeed for you on your behalf. The life you live is the life you build for yourself. There are so many possibilities to choose from, and so many opportunities for you to bridge the gap between where you are and where you want to be. NOW is the moment to actually step forward! Today, I hope you will have another inspired day, that you will dream boldly and dangerously, that you will make some progress that didn’t exist before you took action, that you will love and be loved in return, and that you will find the strength to accept and grow from the troubles you can’t change. And, most importantly (because I think there should be more kindness and wisdom in this world), that you will, when you must, be wise with your decisions, and that you will always be extra kind to yourself and others. And please leave Angel and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this post. Your feedback is important to us.  🙂 (Finally, if you haven’t done so already, be sure to sign-up for our free newsletter to receive new articles like this in your inbox each week.) 10 Painfully Obvious Truths About Life Everyone Forgets Too Soon|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-painfully-truths.jpg?resize=500%2C400&ssl=1| The truth does not disappear when it is ignored. You know how you can hear something a hundred times in a hundred different ways before it finally gets through to you? The ten truths about life discussed here fall firmly into that category – timeless lessons that many of us likely learned years ago, and have been reminded of since, but for whatever reason we haven’t fully grasped them yet. This, my friends, is my attempt at helping all of us, myself included, “get it” and “remember it” once and for all… We know deep down that life is short, and that death will happen to all of us eventually, and yet we are infinitely surprised when it happens to someone we know. It’s like walking up a flight of stairs with a distracted mind, and misjudging the final step. You expected there to be one more stair than there is, and so you find yourself off balance for a moment, before your mind shifts back to the present moment and how the world really is. LIVE your life TODAY! Don’t ignore death, but don’t be afraid of it either. Be afraid of a life you never lived because you were too afraid to take action. Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside you while you’re still alive. So be bold, be courageous… be scared to death, and then take the next step anyway! Your life is yours alone. Others can try to persuade you, but they can’t decide for you. They can walk with you, but not in your shoes. So make sure the path you decide to walk aligns with your own intuition and desires, and don’t be scared to switch paths or pave a new one when it makes sense. Remember, it’s always better to be at the bottom of the ladder you want to climb than the top of the one you don’t. Be productive and patient. And realize that patience is not about waiting; it’s the ability to keep a good attitude while working hard for what you believe in. Yes, at the end of the day this is your life, and to a great extent it’s made up of your little recurring habits and choices. May your daily actions speak louder than your words. May your life preach louder than your lips. May your success be your noise in the end. (Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Passion and Growth” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Busyness isn’t a virtue, nor is it something to respect. Though we all have seasons of crazy schedules, very few of us have a legitimate need to be busy ALL the time. We simply don’t know how to set boundaries, prioritize properly, and say no when we should. Being busy rarely equates to productivity these days. Just take a quick look around. Busy people outnumber productive people by a wide margin. Busy people are rushing all over the place, and running late half of the time. They’re heading to work, conferences, meetings, social engagements, looking at their phones, creating TikToks, etc. They barely have enough free time for exercise and they rarely get enough sleep. Yet, text messages, emails, and social media updates are blasting out of their smart phones like rockets, and their day planners are jammed to the brim with obligations. Their busy schedule gives them an elevated sense of importance. But it’s all an illusion. They’re like hamsters running on a wheel. Though being busy can make us feel more alive than anything else for a moment, the sensation is not sustainable long term. We will inevitably, whether tomorrow or on our deathbed, come to wish that we spent less time in the buzz of busyness and more time actually living a purposeful life. Most mistakes are unavoidable. Learn to forgive yourself. It’s not a problem to make them; it’s only a problem if you never learn from them. If you’re too afraid of failure, you can’t possibly do what needs to be done to be successful. The solution to this problem is making friends with failure. You want to know the difference between a master and a beginner? The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried. Behind every great piece of art is a thousand failed attempts to make it, but these attempts are simply never shown to us. Bottom line: Just because it’s not happening now, doesn’t mean it never will. Learning the way on the way is key. Sometimes things have to go very wrong before they can be right. (Read The Success Principles.) Success never comes to look for you while you wait around thinking about it. You are what you do, not what you say you will do. Knowledge is basically useless without action. Good things don’t come to those who wait; they come to those who work on meaningful goals. Ask yourself what’s really important and then have the courage and determination to build your daily life around your answer. And remember, if you wait until you feel 100% ready to begin, you will likely be waiting the rest of your life. Life gets much easier when you learn to accept the apologies you never received. The key is find some level of peace with every experience – positive or negative. In a way, it’s like taking a step back, letting go a little, and saying, “Thank you for the lesson.” It’s realizing that grudges from the past are a perfect waste of today’s growth and potential, and that holding one is like letting unwanted company live rent-free in your head. Forgiveness is a promise – one you want to keep. When you forgive you are making a promise not to hold the unchangeable past against your present self. It has nothing to do with freeing a past criminal of his or her crime, and everything to do with freeing yourself of the burden of being an eternal victim. You will only ever be as great as the people you surround yourself with, so be brave enough to let go of those who keep bringing you down.  You shouldn’t force connections with people who constantly make you feel less than worthy. If someone makes you feel uncomfortable and insecure every time you’re with them, for whatever reason, they’re probably not close friend material. If they make you feel like you can’t be yourself, or if they make you “less than” in any way, don’t pursue a daily connection with them. If you feel emotionally drained after hanging out with them or get a small hit of anxiety when you are reminded of them, listen to your intuition. You don’t have to exile them from your life, but you can give yourself space. Set boundaries. Make yourself a priority. There are so many “right people” for you – those who energize you and inspire you to be your best self. It makes no sense to constantly force it with people who are the wrong match for you. It’s important to be nice to others, but it’s even more important to be nice to yourself. You really have to love yourself to get anything done in the long run. So make sure you don’t start seeing yourself through the eyes of those who don’t value you. Know your worth, even if they don’t. Today, let someone love you just the way you are – as flawed as you might be, as unattractive as you sometimes feel, and as incomplete as you think you are. Yes, let someone love you despite all of this, and let that someone be YOU. Stuff really is just stuff, and it has absolutely no bearing on who you are as a person. Most of us can make a great life with much less than we think we need. That’s a valuable reminder, especially in a hugely consumer-driven culture that focuses more on material things than meaningful connections and experiences. To paraphrase Terence McKenna, you have to create your own culture. Don’t watch too much TV or YouTube, don’t read every fashion tip online, and don’t consume too much of the evening news. Find the strength to fill your time with meaningful experiences. The space and time you are occupying at this very moment is LIFE, and if you’re worrying about Kim Kardashian or Lebron James or some other famous face, then you are disempowered. You’re giving your life away to marketing and media trickery, which is created by big companies to ultimately motivate you to want to dress a certain way, look a certain way, and be a certain way. This is tragic, this kind of thinking. It’s all just Hollywood brainwashing. What is real is YOU and your friends and your family, your loves, your highs, your hopes, your plans, your fears, etc. Too often we’re told that we’re not important, we’re just peripheral to what is. “Get a degree, get a job, get a car, get a house, and keep on getting.” And it’s sad, because someday you’ll wake up and realize you’ve been tricked. And all you’ll want then is to reclaim your mind by getting it out of the hands of the brainwashers who want to turn you into a drone that buys everything that isn’t needed to impress everyone that isn’t important. Embrace change and realize it happens for a reason. It won’t always be obvious at first, but in the end it will be worth it. What you have today may become what you had by tomorrow. You never know. Things change, often spontaneously. People and circumstances come and go. Life doesn’t stop for anybody. It moves rapidly and rushes from calm to chaos in a matter of seconds, and happens like this to people every day. It’s likely happening to someone relatively nearby right now. Sometimes the shortest split second in time changes the direction of our lives. A seemingly innocuous decision rattles our whole world like a meteorite striking Earth. Entire lives have been swiveled and flipped upside down, for better or worse, on the strength of an unpredictable event. And these events are always happening. However good or bad a situation is now, it will change. That’s the one thing you can count on. So when life is good, enjoy it. Don’t go looking for something better every second. Happiness never comes to those who don’t appreciate what they have while they have it. Which reminder here resonated the most? What else would you add to this list?

And even when the struggle is real, remind yourself that it always feels better to be exhausted from taking small steps forward, than it does to be tired of doing absolutely nothing. In 1911, two explorers, Amundsen and Scott, embarked on a race against each other to become the first known human being to set foot upon the southernmost point of Earth. It was the age of Antarctic exploration, as the South Pole represented one of the last uncharted areas in the world. Amundsen wished to plant the Norwegian flag there on behalf of his country, while Scott hoped to stake his claim for England. The journey there and back from their base camps was about 1,400 miles, which is roughly equivalent to a round-trip hike from New York City to Chicago. Both men would be traveling the same exact distance on foot through extremely cold and harsh weather conditions. And both men were equally equipped with experience, supplies, and a supporting team of fellow explorers. But what wasn’t certain is how each of them would approach the inevitable challenges they faced on the road ahead. As it turned out, Amundsen and Scott took entirely different approaches to the very same challenges. Scott directed his team to hike as far as possible on the good weather days and then rest on bad weather days to conserve energy. Conversely, Amundsen directed his team to follow a strict regimen of consistent daily progress by hiking exactly 20 miles every day, regardless of weather conditions. Even on the warmest, clear-sky days, when Amundsen’s team was capable of hiking much farther, Amundsen was absolutely adamant that they travel no more than 20 miles to conserve their energy for the following day’s hike. Which team succeeded in the end? The team that took consistent daily action. Why? Because what we do EVERY day defines us! Today’s progress is always compounded by yesterday’s effort, no matter how small. And it all comes down to the power of self-discipline. Think about the most common problems we deal with in our modern lives—from lack of presence to lack of exercise to unhealthy diets to procrastination, and so forth. In most cases, problems like these are not caused not by a physically present limitation, but by a weakness of the mind—specifically, a lack of self-discipline. We put the hard things off until tomorrow—because the “weather” is bad—until we’ve lost our edge. We grow accustomed to the idea that things should be easier than they are, and that waiting another day or two makes the best sense. Then one day we wake up and we’re emotionally incapable of doing the hard things that must be done. Let this be your wake-up call! Your mind and body both need to be exercised to gain strength. They need to be challenged, and they need to be worked consistently, to grow and develop over time. If you haven’t pushed yourself in lots of little ways over time—if you always avoid doing the hard things—of course you’ll crumble on the inevitable days that are harder than you expected. And if I had to guess, I’d say Scott’s team suffered in exactly this way. They tried to make things easier on themselves—the fantasy of “easier” became their mantra—their subconscious goal. But this fantasy was never going to be a reality during a 1,400-mile footrace in the South Pole. Scott’s team lost the race, not on the ground, but in their heads first. They were convinced that waiting made things easier. Don’t follow in their footsteps! Many great things can be done in a day if you don’t always make that day tomorrow. Take positive action and plant the right seeds in your life right now. Nature herself does not distinguish between what seeds she receives. She grows whatever seeds are planted. This is the way life works. Be mindful of the seeds you plant today, as they will become the crop you harvest tomorrow. So with that principle in mind, I want to share some key daily practices we’ve seen make all the difference in the lives of hundreds of our coaching clients, course members, and live event attendees over the past 15 years—simple (but far from easy) things they do every day that ultimately move their lives and goals forward. And it’s no surprise that many of these practices directly or indirectly involve strengthening your mindset—because when we think better, we live better. The next step forward is yours for the taking. Just pick one of the aforementioned points and start focusing on it for 15 minutes every day. The key is making sustainable shifts in your beliefs and behavior. That means practicing each point gradually—one at a time, one day at a time, and then letting them build on one another. Go from zero to ten over the course of a few months, not all at once. Will it be easy? Not likely. As you marshal forward in life, adversity is inescapable. It’s much like walking into a turbulent winter storm—like the ones Amundsen and Scott encountered on their race in the South Pole—as you fight to push onward, you not only gain strength, but it tears away from you all but the essential parts of you that cannot be torn. Once you come out of the storm, you see yourself as you really are in raw form, without the baggage that’s been holding you back. And that makes all the difference, because it frees you to take the next step, and the next. So tell me, which point mentioned above will you choose to start working on today?

It’s always necessary to accept when some part of your life has reached its inevitable end. Closing the door, completing the chapter, turning the page, etc. It doesn’t matter what you title it; what matters is that you find the strength to leave in the past those little parts of your life that are over. It’s all about embracing the truth: What has happened is uncontrollable, but what you do now changes everything! Of course, knowing this and actually living a lifestyle that reinforces this truth are two very different things. Letting go is NOT easy – it’s a journey that is traveled one day at a time. If you stick with it though, here’s what your journey will ultimately teach you: It can be difficult to leave a long-term life situation behind, even when your inner-compass tells you that things aren’t right and it’s time to let go. At this point, you can choose to let go and endure the sudden pain of leaving behind the familiar to make way for a new chapter in your life, or you can stay and suffer a constant, aching pain that gradually eats away at your heart and mind, like a cancer… until you wake up one day and find yourself buried so deep in the dysfunction of the situation that you barely remember who you are and what you desire. Don’t do this you yourself! Things will happen that are unexpected, undesirable, and uncontrollable. But you can always choose to take the next tiniest step. Be brave and take it… Be willing to make mistakes, learn from them, let go of them, and move along. (And although I’ve already linked to it above, if you’re looking for more perspective and guidance on what’s been discussed here, this short article is a great primer on the process of letting go.) What’s one uncontrollable past event or life situation that you need to let go of? What attachments are creating unnecessary stress in your life?

"10 Little Things to Remember When Life No Longer Excites You|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-life-excites-you.jpg?resize=500%2C332&ssl=1| Once upon a time, there was a girl who could do anything in the world she wanted. All she had to do was choose something and focus. So one day she sat down in front of a blank canvas and began to paint. Every stroke was more perfect than the next, slowly and gracefully converging to build a flawless masterpiece. And when she eventually finished painting, she stared proudly at her work and smiled. It was obvious to the clouds and the stars, who were always watching over her, that she had a gift. She was an artist. And she knew it too. She felt it in every fiber of her being. But a few moments after she finished painting, she got anxious and quickly stood up. Because she realized that while she had the ability to do anything in the world she wanted to do, she was simply spending her time moving paint around on a piece of canvas. She felt like there was so much more in the world to see and do – so many options. And if she ultimately decided to do something else with her life, then all the time she spent painting would be a waste. So she glanced at her masterpiece one last time, and walked out the door into the moonlight. And as she walked, she thought, and then she walked some more. While she was walking, she didn’t notice the clouds and the stars in the sky who were trying to signal her, because she was preoccupied with an important decision she had to make. She had to choose one thing to do out of all the possibilities in the world. Should she practice medicine? Or design buildings? Or teach children? She was utterly stumped. Twenty-five years later, the girl began to cry. Because she realized she had been walking for so long, and that over the years she had become so enamored by everything that she could do – the endless array of possibilities – that she hadn’t done anything meaningful at all. And she learned, at last, that life isn’t about possibility – anything is possible. Life is about making a decision – deciding to do something that moves you. So the girl, who was no longer a girl, purchased some canvas and paint from a local craft store, drove to a nearby park, and began to paint. One stroke gracefully led into the next just as it had so many moons ago. And as she smiled, she continued painting through the day and into the night. Because she had finally made a decision. And there was still some time left to revel in the magic that life is all about. There’s more to life than just following your passion, right? Absolutely. For instance, not all passions earn an income, at least not in the near-term. And most of us have families to care for, mouths to feed, and bills to pay. So yes, there needs to be more than just passion. But there ALSO needs to be some passion too! The key is to realize it doesn’t have to be all or nothing. The short story above isn’t about following your passion into a hole of debt, it’s about NOT pushing your passion off into an abyss of unhappiness. When you discover something that nourishes your soul and brings you joy and excitement – something that truly matters to you – care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life, even if you can only spare a little time on the side. And if you find that you don’t have any time at all for what matters to you, stop doing things that don’t… like watching another Netflix program or getting lost stalking people on social media. Be intentional about how you spend your time. In the end, purpose is the reason you journey, and passion is the fire that lights your way. Without inner passion, it’s nearly impossible to progress in life. The heart of human excellence begins to beat when you discover a pursuit, big or small, that occupies your heart and soul. So remember, if there was ever a day to follow your heart and do something small that matters to you, that day is today. Here are some little things worth remembering: Passion truly is the secret ingredient that has kept me going through some of the most painful times of my life. Because at some point, especially when the going gets tough, you have to wonder what you’re doing and why. Over the years, I’ve questioned myself and given myself a thousand little reasons to keep working on www.marcandangel.com. And it always comes back to my willingness to passionately invest energy in the exploration of life’s challenges. What distinguishes many of us who are actively pursuing passion, from those of us on the couch, is that some of us have learned the hard way – perhaps through a severe loss or crisis – that life is short, and that we must capitalize on the priceless opportunities each day gives us, on the raw potential our minds and bodies are capable of, and on every ounce of willpower we can muster to make our journeys worthwhile. And if you don’t have a specific passion that’s immediately enticing to you, that’s OK. You can still tap into the passion inside you today. You can still learn to believe in your heart that you’re meant to live each moment full of passion and purpose – that each and every moment is worthy in its own way.  Consider this excerpt from our New York Times bestselling book, Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs: Passion is not something you find in life; it’s something you do. When you want to find the passion and inner strength needed to change your situation, you have to force yourself to step forward. Many of us are still hopelessly trying to “find our passion” – something we believe will ultimately lead us closer to happiness, success, or the life situation we ultimately want. And we say “hopelessly” primarily because passion can’t really be found. When we say we’re trying to find our passion, it implies that our passion is somehow hiding behind a tree or under a rock somewhere. But that’s far from the truth. The truth is, our passion comes from doing things right. If you’re waiting to somehow “find your passion” somewhere outside yourself, so you finally have a reason to put your whole heart and soul into your life and the changes you need to make, you’ll likely be waiting around for an eternity. On the other hand, if you’re tired of waiting, and you’d rather live more passionately starting today and experience small positive changes, it’s time to proactively inject passion into the very next thing you do. Think about it: Like most of us, you’re likely putting a halfhearted effort into most of the things you do on a daily basis. Because you’re still waiting. You’re still waiting to “find” something to be passionate about – some magical reason to step into the life you want to create for yourself. But you need to do the exact opposite! Of course, we can’t do it all and we can’t have it all. Sometimes we have to say no to good things to be able to say yes to the most important things. Sometimes we have to take little risks with our time and energy. But in life, if you don’t risk anything, you risk everything. So go ahead and take a little risk today. Feel some passion. Discover love. Run free. And revel in the magic that life is all about. If you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU.

Everyone tells a story about themselves inside their own head. Every day. All the time. YOU are telling yourself a story right now. And this story is simply a collection of beliefs that ultimately makes you what you are – it lays the foundation for every action you take or don’t take in life. In essence, you build yourself out of this story, one day at a time. For a while everything aligns just fine, or so it seems, and life is good. But then at some point, perhaps sometime in your thirties, forties or fifties, you get slapped with a harsh reality that doesn’t even slightly align with the story you’ve been telling yourself. And it hurts! As you struggle to cope with the pain you’re feeling, you are slapped again and again with similar realities. It goes on like this until you realize that the story you’ve been telling yourself and holding on to all these years is the primary source of your pain, because the beliefs that support the story are utterly and hopelessly false. It isn’t easy, but you have to accept it. You have to seriously sit down with yourself and come to grips with the reality that you were wrong about it all along. What you believed to be true was just an illusion built on false beliefs – a story – that never really was what you thought it was. This is your awakening! Although it hurts in the beginning, it’s a beautiful thing in the long run. As time passes, awareness gradually becomes the new foundation of your journey. Your story gets rewritten with powerful truths. And you learn to let go of countless false beliefs, like these… My challenge to you is this: Live your life not as a bystander… Not as a prisoner to the false beliefs and stories that keep you stuck in your seat. Live in this world, on this day, and everyday hereafter as an active participant. Every morning, ask yourself what is real and important to you, and then find the courage, wisdom and willpower to build your day around your answer. It’s your choice.YOUR choice!You are choosing right now. And if you’re choosing…to complain…to blame…to be stuck in the past…to act like a victim…to feel insecure…to feel anger…to feel hate…to be naive…to ignore your intuition…to ignore good advice…to give up… …then it’s time to choose differently! But, let me also remind you that you are not alone. Generations of human beings in your family tree have chosen. Human beings around the world have chosen. We all have chosen at one time or another. And we stand behind you now whispering: Choose to be present.Choose to be positive.Choose to forgive yourself.Choose to forgive others.Choose to see your value.Choose to see the possibilities.Choose to find meaning.Choose to prove you’re not a victim.Choose to let go of your false beliefs and stories. Choose to find strength in the truth – YOUR TRUTH – so you can take a real step forward today. If you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU.

Should it all end tonight, I can positively say there would be no regrets. I feel fortunate to have walked 90 years in my shoes. I am truly lucky. I really have lived 1,000 times over.” Those are the opening lines of the final entry in my grandmother Zelda’s journal—a 270-page leather-bound journal she wrote small entries in almost every morning during the final decade of her life. In it, she reflected on lessons she had learned, lessons she was still learning, and the experiences that made these understandings possible. When my grandmother was diagnosed with terminal cancer on her 90th birthday, I sat with her in a hospital room for the entire day, in silence, in laughter, in tears, and in awe. Although her body was weak, her mind was intensely strong. The terminal diagnosis inspired her to think about her life, everything she had journaled about over the years, and reflect aloud. So, I gave her the stage—my undivided attention—from sunrise until sunset. As I sat beside her hospital bed, she thumbed through her journal one page at a time, reading dozens of specific entries she wanted me to hear. She spoke softly and passionately about her life, her loves, her losses, her pain, her dreams, her achievements, her happiness, and all the lessons that embodied these points of reference. It was without a doubt one of the most enlightening and unforgettable days of my life. My grandmother passed away exactly two weeks later, peacefully in her sleep. The day after her passing I found out she formally left her journal for me in her will. Since then, I have read it from cover to cover countless times. Although I have shared some of her insights and quotes with blog subscribers, course students, and coaching clients in the past, today would have been my grandmother’s 105th birthday, so I’d like to honor her. To do so, I’m going to re-share excerpts from the journal entries that she shared with me in that hospital room fifteen years ago. I’ve done my best to sort, clean up, copyedit and reorganize her wisdom into 19 inspiring bullet points. I hope you find value in them, too: As I’m wrapping up this short tribute to my grandmother, I’m reminded of a poem by Christian D. Larson that she used to have hanging on her refrigerator when I was a kid. As soon as I was old enough to understand the poem, my grandmother made a photocopy of it for me, and, over 30 years later, I still have that same photocopy laminated and hanging on my office bulletin board. These are words I do my best to live by: “Promise Yourself… To be so strong that nothingcan disturb your peace of mind.To talk health, happiness, and prosperityto every person you meet. To make all your friends feelthat there is something in themTo look at the sunny side of everythingand make your optimism come true. To think only the best, to work only for the best,and to expect only the best.To be just as enthusiastic about the success of othersas you are about your own. To forget the mistakes of the pastand press on to the greater achievements of the future.To wear a cheerful countenance at all timesand give every living creature you meet a smile. To give so much time to the improvement of yourselfthat you have no time to criticize others.To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear,and too happy to permit the presence of trouble. To think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world,not in loud words but great deeds.To live in faith that the whole world is on your sideso long as you are true to the best that is in you.” (Note: Angel and I discuss strategies for living true to these words in the Happiness and Self-Love chapters of our “1,000 Little Things” and “Getting Back to Happy” books.)

"18 Things to Remember When Your Heart is Breaking|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/18-heart-breaking.jpg?resize=500%2C343&ssl=1| “Don’t cry when the sun is gone, because the tears won’t let you see the stars.”— Violeta Parra It’s a dull, subdued sensation, when your heart is breaking, like the muffled sound of a distant gunshot. It doesn’t physically pierce your skin or tear you to pieces, but the sensation is physically present – the paralyzing discomfort of realizing that something you took for granted is leaving for good. Although it’s hard to accept at first, this is actually a good sign, having a broken heart. It means you have loved something, you have tried for something, and you have let life teach you. Life will attempt to break you down sometimes; nothing and no one can completely protect you from this reality. Remaining alone and hiding from the world won’t either, for endless, stagnant solitude will also break you with unhealthy nostalgia and yearning. You have to stand back up and put yourself out there again. Your heart is stronger than you realize. I’ve been there and I’ve seen heartbreak through to the other side. It takes time and patience. Deep heartbreak is kind of like being lost in the woods – every direction leads to nowhere at first. When you are standing in a forest of darkness, you cannot see any light that could ever lead you home. But if you wait for the sun to rise again, and listen when someone assures you that they themselves have stood in that same dark place, and have since moved forward with their life, oftentimes this will bring the hope that’s needed. It’s so hard to give you advice when you’ve got a broken heart, but some words can heal, and this is my attempt to give you hope. You are stronger than you know! Please remember… You are human and the human heart breaks sometimes. Don’t fight it – fight through it! Give yourself a chance to love again, to feel again, and to live again. You are alive and here to risk your heart by putting it into something you believe in, as many times as it takes. If you avoid taking this chance, one thing is certain, you will make it safely to the end, feeling empty and unfulfilled. Don’t do that to yourself. You deserve better. In what ways have you struggled with heartbreak? How have you coped? Please leave a comment below and share your insights with us.

Photo by: Sarah Tett 10 Things to Remember Before You Take Things Personally|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-take-things-personally.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| Let me share three quick stories and some life-changing lessons with you… These stories have been transcribed with permission from coaching sessions we’ve recently conducted with three of our course students. And if there’s one thing these students’ stories have it common, it’s the importance of not taking things too personally. The father on the train wasn’t deliberately trying to annoy other passengers—he was thinking through one of the hardest realities of his life. Those ex-coworkers weren’t really laughing heartlessly—they were simply acting from within the boundaries of their own limited visions. And that grumpy elderly customer was just a humble, heartbroken man. In each story, the subject’s words and actions were all about THEM, not others. And while the people around them might take their annoying, naysaying, grumpy behavior personally, there’s nothing personal about it. Think about it… How often have you taken things too personally? If you’re anything like the rest of us—and that’s OK—it’s probably been quite often. But why? There are quite a few viable and valid answers to the question of why we take things personally. But the one Marc and I have found to be most common through a decade of one-on-one coaching with our course students and private coaching clients is the tendency we all have of putting ourselves at the center, and seeing everything—every event, conversation, circumstance, etc.—from the viewpoint of how it relates to us. And this can have all kinds of adverse effects, from feeling hurt when other people are rude, to feeling sorry for ourselves when things don’t go as planned, to doubting ourselves when we aren’t perfect. Of course, we are not really at the center of everything. That’s not how the world works. It just sometimes seems that way to us. Let’s take a quick look at a few examples… Someone storms into the room in a bad mood, huffing and puffing, and addresses us in a very rude way. Immediately we think to ourselves, “What’s going on here? I don’t deserve to be treated like this. They should know better!” And we are left agitated, offended, and angry. But the truth is the other person’s behavior has very little to do with us. They got mad at something outside the room, and now they’re reactively venting their frustrations. We just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. This reality doesn’t justify their rude behavior, but it needs to be consciously acknowledged so we don’t waste all our mental energy positioning ourselves at the center of the situation and taking everything personally. Now, let’s assume for a moment that a person’s actions actually do seem to relate to us directly—we inadvertently did something that annoyed someone, and now they’re reacting very rudely to us. A situation like this might seem personal, but is it really? Is the magnitude of their rude reaction all about us and the one thing we did to trigger them? No, probably not. It’s mostly just a statement about the other person’s reactions, snap-judgments, anger issues, and expectations of the universe. Again, we’re just a small piece of a much longer story. And likewise, when someone else rejects us, ignores us, doesn’t call us when they said they would, doesn’t show they care, etc. … these reactions have much less to do with us than they have to do with the other person’s history of personal issues. But because we see everything through a lens of how it affects us—a lens that does a poor job of seeing the bigger picture—we tend to react to everyone else’s actions and words as if they are a personal judgment or statement about us. Thus, other people’s anger makes us angry. Other people’s lack of respect makes us feel unworthy. Other people’s unhappiness makes us unhappy. And so it goes. If you’re nodding your head to any of this, it’s time to… What other people say and do, and the attitude they carry, rarely has anything to do with you. People’s reactions and behaviors are about their perspectives, wounds and experiences. Whether people treat you like you’re amazing, or act like you’re the worst, again, is more about them and how they are viewing the world at a given moment in time. Now, I’m certainly not suggesting we should completely ignore all the feedback and insight we receive from others. I’m simply saying that a significant percentage of the emotional pain, disappointment and sadness in our lives comes directly from our tendency to take things too personally. In most cases, it’s far more beneficial and healthy to let go of other people’s beliefs and behaviors and to operate with your own intuition and wisdom as your guide. And that takes practice. Lots and lots of practice. The key is in reminding yourself to gracefully deflect the senseless negativity around you. When you sense negativity coming at you, give it a small push back with a thought like, “That remark (or gesture) is not really about me, it’s about you.” Remember that all people have emotional issues they’re dealing with (just like you), and it makes them defiant, rude, and downright thoughtless sometimes. They are doing the best they can, or they’re not even aware of their issues. In any case, you can learn not to interpret their behaviors as personal attacks, and instead see them as non-personal encounters (like a dog barking in the distance, or a bumblebee buzzing by) that you can either respond to gracefully, or not respond to at all. But again, this doesn’t come naturally—NOT taking things personally is a skill to be honed. To help you practice, I recommend storing the following reminders in an easily accessible location (perhaps by bookmarking this article in your smart phone), and then reading (and re-reading) them whenever you catch yourself taking things personally. Before you go, let me ask you a quick question: And how might reminding yourself of it, daily, stop you from taking things personally? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

The Art of Being Grateful on Really Hard Days|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/art-of-being-grateful.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| “If you’re always grateful for the little things, it’s hard to avoid momentary happiness. It’s a lack of gratitude that often keeps us feeling down.” There’s a little ritual Angel and I practice every single day, that can turn hard days into easier ones, and extremely difficult life situations into far better ones—and it won’t surprise you either. It’s the ritual of gratitude. Of course, this is such a fundamental ritual, and yet it’s one we often forget to practice. But when we do practice diligently, it can quickly transform both our minds and our lives. Let me give you a quick example. Just over a decade ago, I remember one specific night I was struggling with grief, and also feeling very stressed about being broke, without work, and unhappy with the direction of my life. I was depressed, and very lost. But that night I pushed myself hard to put things into perspective. I wrote out a list of everything I was truly grateful for, even as everything in my life seemed to be going wrong. It ended up being a pretty long list, and I still have the list hanging on my home office bulletin board today. Some of the key things on it include: The list keeps going and going, of course, but you get the gist. The little yet marvelous things I was taking for granted every day were now in black and white right in front of me. The hard times I was struggling to cope with didn’t suddenly vanish, but things were put into better perspective. I was no longer focusing solely on the hard times with tunnel vision, but instead broadening my focus into the periphery of my life where a whole list of amazing things existed that could nurture my inner spirit. Yes, there are incredibly painful parts of my life, and it’s OK to feel the pain they bring. But it’s also important that I remember the rest of my life too, and to also remember that even the painful experiences make life as intricate and remarkable as it is. Life would be impossible without challenges. There is no happiness without some sadness—one requires the other. The makeover of my mindset and how I felt about my life in that moment, on that really hard night, was extraordinary. And it all stemmed from going back to the fundamentals—I found some gratitude. I’ve used this same process dozens of times since that night, and it continues to make a world of difference: The bottom line is that the art of being grateful on really hard days starts with you. And make no mistake about it: the secret to being grateful is no secret. You choose to be grateful. Then you do it again and again. If you forget, begin again. A few minutes per day spent journaling a gratitude list, or just reflecting on what you’re grateful for at the moment, can change your life. Do it every morning or evening, by setting a reminder alarm if you must, and see how it affects you. Don’t rush through it either—don’t do it carelessly. Really try to feel genuine gratitude in your heart and mind for everything you list. Focus on the little miracles in your life. And appreciate all your progress too. You’ve been through a lot, but you’ve grown a lot through the ups and downs. Give yourself credit and gratitude for your resilience, and how far you’ve come. If you’d like some additional support with this ritual, or just a bit more perspective, I invite you to listen to a recent podcast episode Angel and I recorded for you, entitled… How to Find Gratitude When Everything Goes Wrong:  Also, you can subscribe for FREE to our whole podcast, THINK BETTER, LIVE BETTER (yes, it shares the title of our annual live event), and you can then listen to the first and second seasons (40+ episodes and counting) on your favorite podcast player right now (M&A on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts).

Don’t be afraid. Have faith. Find the lessons. Trust the journey today. We are all beautiful human beings, just trying to find our way. Today and every day we seek to better understand the meaning of our lives. We long to discover our gifts and release them fully into the world, and we hope to find happiness, peace, and strength along the way. For some of us the key to these desires rings loud and clear, driving what we do and how we do it from moment to moment. For others, these deep seeded needs are buried below the noise of daily life, below ego, below fear, below the pressures and norms that we face in society… and thus, they are rarely addressed. Along my own journey of self-actualization, I’ve witnessed dozens of amazing people — friends, course students, live event attendees, etc. — discover their own paths to happiness and self-fulfillment, and I’ve noticed many common themes emerge. In all cases, the happiness they discover and gradually develop internally is seeded by the realization of certain hard yet fundamental truths about the nature of their lives in the present day. It seems we are all here to realize these truths in our own way, in our own time. And once they resonate fully, not just intellectually, but emotionally and spiritually, we are then better able to find the happiness, peace, and strength we seek… (Note: This is an excerpt from our “Getting Back to Happy” book.) Over the past decade, as Marc and I have gradually worked with hundreds of our course students, coaching clients, and live event attendees, we’ve come to understand that the root cause of most human stress is simply our stubborn propensity to hold on to things. In a nutshell, we hold on tight to the hope that things will go exactly as we imagine, and then we complicate our lives to no end when they don’t. So how can we stop holding on? By realizing that there’s nothing to hold on to in the first place. Most of the things we desperately try to hold on to, as if they’re real, solid, everlasting fixtures in our lives, aren’t really there. Or if they are there in some form, they’re changing, fluid, impermanent, or simply imagined in our minds. Life gets a lot easier to deal with when we understand this. Imagine you’re blindfolded and treading water in the center of a large swimming pool, and you’re struggling desperately to grab the edge of the pool that you think is nearby, but really it’s not—it’s far away. Trying to grab that imaginary edge is stressing you out, and tiring you out, as you splash around aimlessly trying to hold on to something that isn’t there. Now imagine you pause, take a deep breath, and realize that there’s nothing nearby to hold on to. Just water around you. You can continue to struggle with grabbing at something that doesn’t exist… or you can accept that there’s only water around you, and relax, and float. In “Getting Back to Happy”, Marc and I also guide readers through the process of letting GO. And no, it’s not easy. One of the hardest lessons in life is letting go—whether it’s guilt, anger, love or loss. Change is never easy—you fight to hold on and you fight to let go. But letting go is oftentimes the healthiest path forward. It clears out toxic attachments from the past and paves the way to make the most positive use of the present. You’ve got to emotionally free yourself from some of the things that once meant a lot to you, so you can move beyond the past and the pain it brings you. If somebody is working on themselves and changing for the better, it’s unnecessary to keep bringing up their past. People can change and grow. You know this is true. But, have you given yourself a fair chance to change and grow, too? Have you consciously loosened your grip on everything that’s behind you, so you can step forward again with grace? If you’re shaking your head, you aren’t alone. I know exactly how you feel. I’ve been there myself, and I know dozens of others in the same boat. At times, we all fall victim to our attachments. And sometimes we don’t even realize we’re blocking our own present blessings by holding on to the past. Do your best to realize this right now… Growth is painful. Change is painful. But in the end, nothing is as painful as staying stuck somewhere in the past. Remind yourself of a powerful lesson … a vital truth: You can have a heartbreaking story from the past, without letting it rule your present. In the present moment, we all have some kind of pain: anger, sadness, frustration, disappointment, regret, etc. Notice this pain within yourself, watch it closely, and see that it’s caused by whatever story you have in your head about what happened in the past (either in the recent past or in the distant past). Your mind might insist that the pain you feel is caused by what happened (not by the story in your head about it), but what happened in the past is NOT happening right now. It’s over. It has passed. But the pain is still happening right now because of the story you’ve been subconsciously telling yourself about that past incident. Note that “story” does not mean “fake story.” It also does not mean “true story.” The word “story” in the context of your self-evaluation doesn’t have to imply true or false, positive or negative, or any other kind of forceful judgment call. It’s simply a process that’s happening inside your head: So just notice what story you have, without judging it, and without judging yourself. It’s natural to have a story; we all have stories. See yours for what it is. And see that it’s causing you pain. Then take a deep breath, and another… Inner peace begins the moment you take these deep breaths and choose not to allow the past to rule your present emotions. Have faith in the NOW. Some things in life are worth changing and controlling. Most things are not. Let that sink in for a moment. “If you want to control the animals, give them a larger pasture.” That’s a quote Marc and I heard at a meditation retreat several years ago in a group discussion focused on the power of changing your attitude about the things you can’t change or don’t need to change. I see “the animals” and their “larger pasture” as a form of letting go and allowing things to be the way they are. Instead of trying to tightly control something, you’re loosening up, giving it more space—a larger pasture. The animals will be happier; they will roam around and do what they naturally do. And your needs will be met too; you will have more space to be at peace with the way the animals are. This same philosophy holds true for many aspects of life—stepping back and allowing certain things to happen means these things will take care of themselves, and your needs will also be met. You will have less stress (and less to do), and more time and energy to work on the things that truly matter, and the things you actually can control—like your attitude about everything. This form of letting go is not giving up. It’s about surrendering any obsessive attachment to particular people, outcomes and situations. It means showing up every day in your life with the intention to be your best self, and to do the best you know how, without expecting life to go a certain way. It’s about focusing on what matters and letting go of what does not. The energy of someone aspiring to create something wonderful, teamed with this kind of surrender, is far more powerful and rewarding than someone determined to create outcomes with a desperate “must have” mentality. Surrender brings inner peace and joy, and lest we forget that our outer lives are a reflection of our inner state of being. So, go ahead and put yourself back in control by letting most things be. This morning I was replying to emails from our newest course students when I came across one from a student named Laura that immediately grabbed my attention. The subject read: “Your book gave me strength when I was dying.” The opening paragraph of her email went on to say, “I just want to thank you for giving me hope, daily reminders, and the little tools I needed. As I was literally fighting for my life after emergency heart surgery, I read the copy of your new book that you sent me while I was in the hospital. During the hardest part of the recovery process, I’d try to force myself to read for just five minutes at a time because it was all the energy I had. But even in small doses, your words kept my spirits high and focused effectively when I needed it most. The daily ritual of reading your book was truly my lifeline at times. And believe it or not, the 50% estimated chance of full recovery they gave me just a couple short months ago became 99.9% this morning when my doctors officially concluded that my surgery and ongoing procedures have all been incredibly successful.” Now, that’s pretty darn incredible! Talk about a brave woman and an inspiring journey! And then she wrapped up her email with this: “I’m just so grateful I get to use what you’ve taught me for my second chance at life.” Above all else, her email reminds me that too many of us wait too long to live our best lives. We keep putting everything that’s important to us off until tomorrow. Then, before we know it, we find ourselves asking, “How did it get so late so soon?” Or, we simply don’t have as much time as we expected. Don’t let this be YOU. Like Laura, make today the beginning of your second chance at life. Take time to figure yourself out. Take time to realize what you want and need. Take time to take risks. Take time to love, laugh, cry, learn, and work for what you need. Life is shorter than it often seems. Let this be your wake-up call to stop waiting. What we do today day defines us! Tomorrow’s progress is always compounded by today’s effort, no matter how small. Many wonderful little things can be done in a day if you don’t always make that day tomorrow. Take positive action and plant the right seeds in your life. Nature herself does not distinguish between what seeds she receives. She grows whatever seeds are planted. This is the way life works. Be mindful of the seeds you plant today, as they will become the crop you harvest tomorrow. Truth be told, someday there REALLY won’t be a tomorrow! And this hard reality needs to be respected. I was actually reminded of all this earlier today when I was chatting with a 74-year-old course student about regrets, and she started our call by saying (I’m sharing this with permission): “Why didn’t I learn to accept and appreciate it all, and treat every day like it was the last time? Honestly, my biggest regret is how often I believed in tomorrow.” … May we all take heed to her words, and learn from them. If you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU.

They rolled down the windows and turned up some jazz music on the radio. Then the man got out of the car, walked around to the passenger side, and opened the door for the woman. He took her hand and helped her out of her seat, guided her about ten feet away from the car, and they slow danced for the next half hour under the oak tree. It was a beautiful sight to see. I could have watched them forever. And as they wrapped things up and started making their way back to the car, I clapped my hands in admiration. Perhaps doing so was obnoxious. Perhaps I should have just appreciated being a silent witness. But I was so caught up in the moment—so incredibly moved—that my hands came together before my conscious mind caught on. And I’m sincerely grateful they did, because what happened next inspired the words you’re reading now. The elderly couple slowly walked over to me with smiles on their faces. “Thank you for the applause,” the woman chuckled. “Thank YOU,” I immediately replied. “You two dancing gives me hope.” They both smiled even wider as they looked at me. “Us dancing gives me hope too,” the woman said as she grabbed the man’s hand. “But what you probably don’t realize is that you just witnessed the power and beauty of second and third chances.” “What do you mean?” I asked. “My college sweetheart—my husband of 20 years—lost his life to cancer on my 40th birthday,” she explained. “And then my husband of 6 years died in a car accident when I was 52.” As my mouth hung open, we all shared a quick moment of silence. Then the man put his arm around her and said, “And I lost my wife of 33 years when I was 54. So what you see here before you—these dancing partners—this incredible love—this marriage of only 3 years between two kindred souls in their late 60’s . . . all of this is what happens when you give yourself a second and third chance.” I’ve spent the rest of the day thinking about that beautiful couple, about second and third chances, and about how human beings find the motivation to keep going . . . to keep loving . . . to keep living, despite the pain and grief and hopelessness we all inevitably experience along the way. And this topic hits close to home too. About a decade ago, in a relatively short time-frame, Angel and I dealt with several significant, unexpected losses and life changes, back-to-back: Those experiences were brutal. And enduring them in quick succession knocked us down and off course for a period of time. For example, when Angel’s brother passed, facing this reality while supporting her grieving family was incredibly painful at times. There were moments when we shut the world out and avoided our loved ones who were grieving alongside us. We didn’t want to deal with the pain, so we coped by running away, by finding ways to numb ourselves with alcohol and unhealthy distractions. And consequently, we grew physically ill while the pain continued to fester inside us. We felt terrible, for far too long. And getting to the right state of mind—one that actually allowed us to physically and emotionally move forward again—required diligent practice. Because you better believe our minds were buried deep in the gutter. We had to learn to consciously free our minds, so we could think straight and open ourselves to the next step. We learned that when you face struggles with an attitude of openness—open to the painful feelings and emotions you have—it’s not comfortable, but you can still be fine and you can still step forward. Openness means you don’t instantly decide that you know this is only going to be a horrible experience—it means you admit that you don’t really know what the next step will be like, and you’d like to understand the whole truth of the matter. It’s a learning stance, instead of one that assumes the worst. The simplest way to initiate this mindset shift? Proactive daily reminders… It’s all about keeping the right thoughts at the top of your mind, so they’re readily available when you need them most. For us, that meant sitting down quietly with ourselves every morning (and on evenings sometimes too) and reflecting on precisely what we needed to remember. We used short written reminders (now excerpts from our books) like the ones below to do just that. Sometimes we’d call them mantras, or affirmations, or prayers, or convictions, but in any case these daily reflections kept us motivated and on track by keeping grounded, peaceful, productive thoughts at the top of our minds, even when life got utterly chaotic. We ultimately discovered that peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble, or hard realities to deal with—peace means to be in the midst of all those things while remaining calm in your head and strong in your heart. Challenge yourself to choose one of the bolded reminders below every morning (or evening), and then sit quietly for two minutes while repeating it silently in your mind like a mantra. See how doing so gradually changes the way you navigate life’s twists and turns and hard times. Before we go I want to briefly address the biggest elephant in the room. That elephant is losing someone you love. The elderly couple in the opening story lived through this kind of loss. Angel and I have lived through this kind of loss. And although there are no words to make it easier, I want those who are presently coping with this kind of loss to know that the journey forward is worth it. The end is always the beginning. There’s more beauty—a different kind of beauty—ahead. You see, death is an ending, which is a necessary part of living. And even though endings like these often seem ugly, they are necessary for beauty too—otherwise it’s impossible to appreciate someone or something, because they are unlimited. Limits illuminate beauty, and death is the definitive limit—a reminder that we need to be aware of this beautiful person, and appreciate this beautiful thing called life. Death is also a beginning, because while we have lost someone special, this ending, like the loss of any wonderful life situation, is a moment of reinvention. Although deeply sad, their passing forces us to reinvent our lives, and in this reinvention is an opportunity to experience beauty in new, unseen ways and places. And finally, of course, death is an opportunity to celebrate a person’s life, and to be grateful for the beauty they showed us. That’s just a small slice of what living through deep loss has taught us. Just a short piece of a longer story that’s still being written . . . A story of second and third chances, renewed hope, and heartfelt dances. And the reminders above will get you there, one day at a time. Before you go, let me ask you a quick question: And how might reminding yourself of it, daily, change your life? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

"10 Beliefs We Often Embrace Long After it’s Time to Let Go|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/10-beliefs-let-go.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| One of the strongest signs of your growth is realizing you’re no longer limited by the beliefs that once used to drain you. Marc and I received a thank you email recently from a longtime reader and coaching client named Kevin (we’re writing about him today with his consent). He said our books and life coaching sessions helped him and his wife maintain a positive, intentional mindset as they struggled and grew through one of the most difficult periods of their lives. Certain sections of his email nearly moved me to tears: “As you know, after injuring my back, losing my job because of it, being evicted from our apartment, moving in with Laura’s parents, nursing my five-year-old through a nearly fatal bout of strep throat, I was stuck in a deep rut for a long time. And I was sitting on the front porch of my in-law’s house feeling sorry for myself, yet again one morning, when one of my best friends called me crying and said, ‘Mel-Mel-Melissa, my baby girl, was paralyzed in a car wreck yesterday.’ And suddenly I felt like the lucky one…” Kevin then went on to say, “It was the shock of Melissa’s tragic accident that motivated me to review ten pages of notes I had previously taken from your books and our most recent coaching sessions. And this time your wisdom sunk in! It’s like a light bulb suddenly illuminated in my mind, and it literally changed my entire outlook from negative to positive. In that moment I realized there were people who needed me to get back up, and infinite reasons and ways to do my very best with what I had. So I started challenging myself and letting go of the negative beliefs I had been holding on to, and then I took a bold step forward, and another, and another. And it’s been almost a year now, and I’m grateful to say you were right!” If you can relate to Kevin’s situation in any way, and you’re ready to move forward, I want to remind you that today is the first day of the rest of your life. You can get yourself back on track! But first, you have to… When times get tough, our worst battle is often between what we remember and what we presently feel. Thus, one of the hardest decisions you will ever have to make is when to stay put and struggle harder or when to take your memories and move on. Sometimes you have to step outside of the person you’ve been, and remember the person you were meant to be, the person you are capable of being, and the person you truly are today. In other words, you are not what happened. You are what you choose to become in this moment. Let go, breathe, and begin again. Being kind to yourself in thoughts, words, and actions is just as important as being kind to others. Extend yourself this courtesy today. Love yourself — your real self. Work through your fears (dive deep), your insecurities (speak honestly and loudly), and your anger (scream into the pillow and at therapy — not into the mirror, nor the people you care about; they don’t deserve it.) Instead of hurting yourself by hiding from your problems, help yourself grow beyond them. That’s what self-care is all about. It’s about facing the inner issues that make you believe that you are less than you are. It’s learning to see that you are already beautiful. Not because you’re blind to your shortcomings, but because you know they have to be there to balance out your strengths. When you stay stuck in regret of the life you think you should have had, you end up missing the beauty of what you do have. Not all the puzzle pieces of life will seem to fit together at first, but in time you’ll realize they do, almost perfectly. So thank the things that didn’t work out, because they just made room for the things that will. And thank the ones who walked away from you, because they just made room for the ones who won’t. As they say, every new beginning comes from another beginning’s end. To be reasonably positive in negative times is not just foolish optimism. It’s well grounded by the fact that human history is a history not only of tragedy, but also of success, sacrifice, courage, kindness, and growth. What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine how well we live. If we look only for the worst, it destroys our capacity to do our best work. But if we also remember those times and places — and there are many — in which people have behaved magnificently, and things have gone well, this gives us the inspiration and energy to push forward with great intention and grace… And when we do act, in however small a way, we don’t have to sit around waiting for some grandiose and perfect future to celebrate. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live right now in defiance of all the negativity around us, is in itself an amazing victory. Yes, our lives are worth celebrating every step of the way, and life gets better and better when WE get better. So start investing in yourself mentally and physically. Make it a priority to learn and grow a little bit every day by building positive rituals and sticking to them. The stronger you grow and become, the better your life will feel in the long run. Just because someone else can, doesn’t mean you can, right? Because you’re not good enough, or you’ve already missed your chance, or it’s just not in the cards for you. You look for reasons they can do it but you can’t… OK fine, it’s easy to find excuses: but look at all the other people who also have considerable obstacles and have done it anyway. Marc and I have a family, and have coped with significant loss in our lives, and still managed to make meaningful progress in our lives. And just as we’ve turned things around for ourselves, we know hundreds of other people who’ve done the same. Through nearly 15 years of work with our students and our coaching clients, we’ve witnessed people reinventing themselves at all ages — 48-year olds starting healthy families, 57-year-olds graduating from college for the first time, 71-year-olds starting successful businesses, and so forth. And stories abound of people with disabilities or illnesses who overcame their obstacles to achieve incredible outcomes. No one else can succeed for you on your behalf. The life you live is the life you build for yourself. There are so many possibilities to choose from, and so many opportunities for you to bridge the gap between where you are and where you want to be. NOW is the moment to actually step forward! The truth is, there is no one correct path in life. A path that’s right for someone else won’t necessarily be a path that’s right for you. And that’s OK. Your journey isn’t right or wrong, good or bad — it’s just different. Your life isn’t meant to look exactly like anyone else’s because you aren’t exactly like anyone else. You’re a person all your own with a unique set of goals, obstacles, dreams, and needs. So stop comparing and start living. You may not always end up where you intend to go, but you will eventually arrive precisely where you need to be. Trust that you are in the right place at the right time, right now. And trust yourself to make the best of it. (Read The Untethered Soul.) People know your name, not your story. They’ve heard what you’ve done, but don’t understand what you’ve been through. So take their opinions of you with a grain of salt. In the end, it’s not what others think, it’s what you think about yourself that counts the most. Sometimes you have to do exactly what’s right for you and your life, without giving a darn what your life looks like to everyone who doesn’t even know you. Not all toxic relationships are agonizing and uncaring on purpose. Some of them involve people who care about you — people who have good intentions, but are toxic because their needs and way of existing in the world force you to compromise yourself and your happiness. They aren’t inherently bad people, but they aren’t the right people to be spending time with every day. And as hard as it is, we have to distance ourselves enough to give ourselves space to live. You simply can’t ruin yourself on a daily basis for the sake of someone else. You have to create boundaries and make your well-being a priority. Whether that means breaking up with someone, loving a family member from a distance for a little while, letting go of a friendship, or removing yourself from a daily situation that feels painful — you have every right to create some healthy space for yourself. (Note: Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the Relationships chapter of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.) When your worries and fears have you looking too deep into things, it creates problems, it doesn’t fix them. If you think and you think and you think, you will think yourself right out of happiness a thousand times over, and never once into it. Worrying doesn’t take away tomorrow’s troubles, it takes away today’s peace and potential. And life is just too short for that. So when you catch yourself going down a rabbit hole of worry, try using the simple phrase “The story I’m telling myself” as a prefix to your troubling thoughts. Here’s how it works: The story I’m telling myself can be applied to any difficult life situation or circumstance in which a troubling thought is getting the best of you. For example, perhaps someone you love (husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, etc.) didn’t call you or text you when they said they would, and now an hour has passed and you’re feeling upset because you’re obviously not a high enough priority to them. When you catch yourself feeling this way, use the phrase: The story I’m telling myself is that they didn’t call me because I’m not a high enough priority to them. Then ask yourself these questions: Give yourself the space to think it all through carefully. Challenge yourself to think better on a daily basis — to challenge the stories you subconsciously tell yourself and do a reality check with a more objective mindset. It’s always possible to go on, no matter how impossible it seems. Remember that you’ve been in this place before. You’ve been this uncomfortable and unsure, and you got through it. You can get through it this time too! And yet I know how incredibly hard it can feel. This is how Marc and I felt a decade ago when we were knocked down and stuck in a rut after simultaneously losing two loved ones to death. It was nearly impossible to move anywhere significant when we didn’t feel we had the strength to push forward. So if you’re feeling this way now — like it’s impossible to make significant progress today — you aren’t wrong for feeling what you feel. In many cases, you’re right: significant progress comes gradually with time and consistency. It’s all about taking one tiny positive step at a time, and staying the course… Consider the rest of this section, which is an excerpt from “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts and Reflections to Start Every Day”: Think about the fact that it only takes a one degree change in temperature to convert water to vapor, or ice to water. It’s such a tiny change — just one step in a different direction — and yet the results are dramatic. A tiny change can make all the difference in the world. Now, consider another example where a tiny change is compounded by time and distance. Perhaps you’re trying to travel somewhere specific, but you’re off course by just one tiny degree in the wrong direction… You get the idea — over time and distance, a mere one-degree change in course makes a significant difference…  This same philosophy holds true in various aspects of our lives. The tiniest things we do each day — positive and negative alike — can make all the difference. They either bring us closer or farther away from where we ultimately want to be. Know this! And take the next tiniest step forward for yourself today. Today, I hope you will let go and have an inspired day, that you will boldly believe in yourself, that you will make just a tiny bit of progress that didn’t exist before you took action, that you will love and be loved in return, and that you will find the strength to accept and grow from the troubles you can’t change. And, most importantly (because I think there should be more kindness and wisdom in this world), that you will, when you must, be wise with your decisions, and that you will always be extra kind to yourself and others.

Don’t settle. What is the opposite of distraction? Traction — you want to create consistent traction on the road of life. If you’ve been spinning your figurative wheels a lot lately, feeling a bit tired and vexed without much forward progress, I highly recommend you rethink how you’re investing your time, and replace the meaningless with the meaningful — the distraction with traction! Ultimately, you become a true master of your life when you learn how to master your focus — where your energy goes. Value what you give your time to. Rise above the pettiness trying to draw you in. Figure out where your attention actually goes, and gradually remove needless distractions. Remember, there’s a big difference between empty fatigue and gratifying exhaustion. Life is too short not to focus more on what matters most! So today let’s reflect on three common distractions Angel and I have seen robbing happiness from coaching clients we’ve worked with over the past 15 years. These distractions are so darn prevalent too, nearly all of us mistakenly engage in at least one of them over the course of our lives. Because, despite what our better judgment tells us, we often think we want and need… An easy, leisurely day sounds nice, and it can be nice for a little while. But it’s not the kind of day you’ll look back on with gratitude for how far you’ve come. And it’s not the kind of daily routine you want to be endlessly distracted by. Truth be told, when you’re struggling to make progress in life, that’s when you actually are. You want to be stretched to the edge of your ability at least a few times a week; it needs to be hard and a bit uncomfortable at reasonable intervals. Of course, most of us don’t want to be uncomfortable at all, so we subconsciously run from the possibility of discomfort at all costs. The obvious problem with this behavior is that, by running from discomfort, we are constrained to partake in only the opportunities within our comfort zones. And since our comfort zones are relativity small, we miss out on most of life’s greatest and healthiest experiences, and we get stuck in a debilitating cycle. We keep doing what we’ve always done, and thus we keep getting the results we’ve always gotten. And our true potential falls by the wayside. So are you selling yourself short on a regular basis? Think about it… In the past year alone the answer to all three questions is probably dozens for most people, including myself. And these questions can be easily reworked and applied to various other areas of our lives too. Bottom line: Don’t sell yourself short of your potential! Choose differently. Choose yourself… Go to environments that expand your mind. Spend time with people who inspire you to stretch yourself. Read books. Grow. Work. Get better. Your life is mostly your choice. (Note: Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the Success and Productivity chapters of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.) Make no mistake about it: perfectionism is a distraction. Yet too many of us fear that we will somehow be held back by our imperfections. But in reality, the exact opposite is often true — the full acceptance of our imperfections is what ultimately sets us free. Thus, understanding the difference between reasonable striving and perfectionism is critical to letting go of distractions and picking up your life. Perfectionism of all shapes and sizes not only causes you unnecessary stress and unhappiness from the superficial need to always “get it right,” it actually prevents you from getting anything worthwhile done at all. So think progress, not perfection. The real world doesn’t reward perfection. It rewards people who get good things done. And the only way to get good things done is to be imperfect 99% of the time… Eventually most of us end up settling in some part of our life. We let go of certain ideals, we compromise, and we make trade-offs. We gradually learn that we can’t have everything we want, because everything has an opportunity cost, and not every outcome in life can be perfectly controlled. But if we pay close attention we also learn that we can make the best of every outcome, and still get a lot of what we want in life, if we manage our energy appropriately. And these realizations collectively lead to an interesting question: When should you settle, or compromise, and when should you continue fighting hard for what you ideally want to achieve? There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, but when you encounter a situation that forces you to choose between compromise and fighting forward against the opposition, it might help to also ask yourself: “Do I really need this, or do I just kinda want it?” Being able to distinguish needs from wants is essential in every walk of life. Never let go of an outcome you truly need in your life, but be reasonably flexible on the outcomes you want but could live fine without. In other words, choose your battles wisely, and don’t let “perfect” become the enemy of a good life. Remind yourself that what you pay attention to grows. So focus on what really matters and let go of what does not… Don’t give up 60% of your life working 60-hour weeks at a day job that makes you absolutely miserable. Don’t abandon your sanity for the wrong reasons. Don’t neglect lifelong goals and dreams that have withstood the tests of time and still bring incredible meaning into your life. If you really need something, fight hard for it! But for everything else, let go a little. Loosen your grip, compromise… and settle. Settle on less of the unessential, to get more of what you really need in life. We worry about what other people think of us. We worry about our appearance. We worry about whether or not he’ll like us. We worry she might like that other guy. We worry we’ll fall flat on our faces. We worry we’re not enough just the way we are. And social media — with its culture of getting us to seek constant approval with virtual likes and hearts — with its endless highlight reel of perfect bodies and exotic travels — it only intensifies the problem. Realize this! You don’t need any of that social validation in your life on the daily! It’s all just a distraction… When you find yourself trapped between what feels right to you and what others tell you is right for you, listen to your inner compass. Because no matter where life takes you, big cities or small towns, you will come across others who think they know what’s best for you — people who think they’re better than you — people who think happiness and success mean the same things to everyone. They’ll try to measure your worth based on what you have, instead of who you are. But you know better than that — shiny objects and flashy figures don’t matter that much. Don’t just chase the money. Don’t just chase the numbers. Catch up to the ideas and activities that make you come alive on daily basis. Go for the things of greater value — the things money and temporary social clout can’t buy. What matters is having strength of character, an honest heart, and a sense of self-worth in the long run… You have to admit, you’ve spent a lot of your life subconsciously belittling yourself. Thinking you’re not enough. Trying to be someone else. Someone who fits in. Someone who’s less sensitive. Less needy. Less flawed. Less YOU. Because you felt broken, and you didn’t want to scare people away. You wanted them to like you. You wanted to make a good impression. You wanted to be seen as worthy and lovable to everyone… so you could feel healed and whole. And so for the longest time, behind a facade of fake smiles, you have inadvertently betrayed yourself for the purpose of pleasing everyone else. And for longest time, your heart has ached. But you’re at a point now where you’re seeing things differently. The heartache just isn’t worth it anymore. Belittling yourself for one more day just doesn’t make any sense. And more than that, you now realize no matter what you do or how you change, some people will never be pleased anyway. You now realize you have to start doing things for the right reasons! Not because it’s what you think everyone else needs, but because you finally know yourself to be worthy of your own values and priorities. Not because other people approve of you, but because you are breathing your own air, thinking your own thoughts, and occupying a space no one else ever could. Yes, you are indeed worthy! Your ideas are worthy. Your feelings are worthy. Your needs are worthy. And without everyone else’s validation, you must be who you are and live your truth. Even if it makes people turn their heads. Even if it means walking alone down the path less traveled for awhile… Remember, the real battle is always in your mind, and your mind is under your control, not the other way around. So do your best to use disappointment and frustration to motivate you rather than distract you today. Be mindful. You are in control of the way you respond to life. You may have been broken down by failure or rejection or stress, but YOU are not broken. So don’t let others convince you otherwise. And don’t let your mind get the best of you either. Heal yourself by refusing to belittle yourself. Choose to take up a lot of positive space in your own life today. Choose to give yourself permission to meet your own needs. Choose to honor your feelings and emotions. Choose to make self-love and self-care a part of your daily habits and rituals… Choose to think better about yourself, and validate yourself, so you can live better in spite of the challenges you face. (Note: “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts and Reflections to Start Every Day” is a great tool for this kind of daily self-reflection and self-validation.) Yes, it’s your turn to practice paying more attention to the beauty and practicality of living a less distracted life. A life uncluttered by most of the meaningless things people fill their lives with, leaving you with space for what’s truly meaningful. A life that isn’t constant rushing, worrying, waiting, or stress, but instead contemplation, creation, and connection with the people and projects that matter most to you. By redefining your priorities, and building healthy habits and rituals to back them up, you can literally start changing your life in the days ahead. But before you go, please leave Angel and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay. Your feedback is important to us. 🙂 Which one of the points above resonated the most today?

Have you ever told yourself that you’re going to make something happen and then nothing happened? All details aside, it’s because you didn’t have the right habits in place — the little things you do every day that build up to something bigger. Your habits truly make or break you. Because in all walks of life you become what you habitually do. You will never make progress or change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret to your success is always found in your daily habits and routines. In other words, regardless of your unique life situation or how you personally define success, you can’t become an overnight success. You become successful over time from all the little things you do one day at a time. Failure occurs in the same way. All your little daily failures (that you don’t learn and grow from) come together and cause you to fail… And then one day you wake up and your business has failed. It was all the little things you did or didn’t do along the way — your daily habits — not just one big catastrophic event. Let this be your wake-up call. YOUR LIFE IS YOUR BUSINESS! YOUR HABITS ARE YOUR BUSINESS! So today, let’s discuss some super-common daily habits Marc and I have seen plaguing dozens of our course students and conference attendees over the past decade — little things many people do over and over again that waste nearly all their time: There’s a saying that the definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Take this to heart. If you keep doing what you’re doing, you’ll keep getting what you’re getting. Oftentimes the only difference between a successful person and a person who makes little progress is not one’s superior abilities, but the courage that one has to bet on their ideas, to take calculated risks, and to take steady steps forward. Truly, some people sit and wait for the magic beans to arrive while the rest of us just get up and get to work. Even when we have productive intentions, too many of us waste so much of our time waiting for ideal paths to appear. But they never do of course, because we forget that paths are made by walking, not waiting. So stop waiting today… Think of today as the beginning — the conception of a new life. The next nine months are all yours. You can do with them as you please. Make them count! Because a new person is born in nine months. The only question is: Who do you want that person to be? Now is the time to decide. And no, you shouldn’t feel more confident before you take the next step. Taking the next step is what builds your confidence and fuels your inner and outer growth. A goal is a point of achievement that requires effort and sacrifice. There are no esteemed goals worth participating in that don’t require some level of effort and sacrifice. Marc’s 90-year-old grandmother once told us, “Decades from now when you’re getting closer to the end, you will not remember the days that were easy, you will cherish the moments when you rose above your difficulties and conquered challenges of magnitude. You will dream of the strength you found within yourself that allowed you to achieve what once seemed impossible.” So don’t just do what’s easy today, do what you’re capable of. Astound yourself with your own abilities. And as you struggle forward, remember, it’s far better to be exhausted from little bits of effort and learning than to be tired of doing absolutely nothing. Effort is never wasted, even when it leads to disappointing results. For it always makes you stronger and more experienced in the long run. Living is about learning as you go. Living is risky business. Every decision, every interaction, every step, every time you get out of bed in the morning, you take a small risk. To truly live is to know you’re getting up and taking that risk, and to trust yourself to take it. To not get out of bed, clutching to illusions of safety, is to die slowly without ever having truly lived… Think about it. If you ignore your instincts and let shallow feelings of uncertainty constantly stop you, you will never know anything for sure, and in many ways this un-knowing will be worse than finding out your instincts were wrong. Because if you were wrong, you could make adjustments and carry on with your life, without always looking back and wondering what might have been. Be okay with walking away when the time comes. Rejection teaches us how to reject what’s not right for our well-being. It won’t always be easy, but some chapters in our lives have to close without closure. There’s no point in losing yourself by trying to fix what’s meant to stay broken. All too often we let the rejections of our past dictate every move we make thereafter. We literally do not know ourselves to be any better than what some opinionated person or isolated circumstance once told us was true. Of course, this old rejection doesn’t mean we aren’t good enough — it means the other person or circumstance failed to align with what we had to offer at the time. It means we have more time now to improve our thing, to build upon our ideas, to perfect our craft, and to indulge deeper into the work that moves us. And that’s exactly what YOU need to do, starting now. You aren’t responsible for everything that happened to you, but you need to be responsible for undoing the thinking and behavioral patterns these outcomes created within you. Blaming the past for a limiting mindset today doesn’t fix it. Change your response to what you remember, and step forward again with grace. A combination of your decisions and external factors for which you had no control brought you to where you are today. Negatively blaming someone else, or some past circumstance, will change nothing. Positively taking full responsibility for the next step on your path forward can change everything. Leave the unchangeable past behind you as you diligently give yourself to the present moment. In this moment is every possibility you seek. Take responsibility for it, and bring these possibilities to life. Remember that success in life does not depend on always being right. To make real progress you must let go of the assumption that you already have all the answers. Even as you grow wiser with age, you must remind yourself that an understanding is never absolutely final. What’s currently right could easily be wrong later. Thus, the most destructive illusion is a settled point of view. So don’t stop learning! Don’t stop investing in yourself. Study. Read. Devour books. Engage with people, including those who think differently. Ask questions. Listen closely. And don’t just grow in knowledge. Be a person who gives back. Use what you’re learning to make a real and lasting difference. (Note: “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts and Reflections to Start Every Day” is a great tool for keeping yourself on track with this kind of fresh daily perspective.) Your mind is your private sanctuary; do not allow the negative beliefs of others to occupy it. Your skin is your barrier; do not allow others to get under it. Take good care of your personal boundaries and what you allow yourself to absorb from others. Of course, there will inevitably be a few people in your life who will be critical of you regardless of what you do or how well you do it. If you say you want to be a dancer, they will discredit your taste in music. If you say you want to build a new business, they will give you a dozen reasons why it might not work. They somehow assume you don’t have what it takes, but they are dead wrong! Let that sink in… It’s a lot easier to be negative than positive — a lot easier to be critical than correct. When you’re embarking on a new venture, instead of listening to the few critics that will try to distract you, spend time talking to one of the hundreds of people in this world who are willing to support your efforts and acknowledge your potential, respectfully. And go ahead and leave us a comment down at the bottom of this post if you think you can’t find one. Remind yourself right now that not everything is meant to be. Sometimes you have to track the data, review the data, and seriously sit down with yourself and come to grips with the fact that you were wrong about it all along. It was just an illusion that never really was what you thought it was. It’s one of the most difficult realizations to accept, to realize that you feel a sense of loss, even though you never really had what you thought you had in the first place. The key is knowing this, learning from it, letting go, and taking the next step forward. (Note: Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the Adversity and Growth chapters of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.) Simple things become complicated when you expect too much. Rigid expectations truly are a root cause of heartache. Don’t let them get the best of you. Every difficult life situation can be an excuse for hopelessness or an opportunity for personal growth, depending on what you choose to do with it. So start by choosing to let go of the expectations that aren’t serving you. A mistake doesn’t hurt, expectation does. A rejection doesn’t hurt, expectation does. And so it goes… Remember, the mind is your battleground. It’s the place where the fiercest conflict resides. It’s where half the things you feared would happen, never actually happened. It’s where your expectations get the best of you, and you fall victim to your own train of thought time and time again. So don’t lower your standards, but do remember that removing your rigid expectations in life is the best way to avoid being disappointed by everyone and everything you encounter. Truth be told, one of the most important moments in life is the moment you finally find the courage to let go of what can’t be changed. Because, when you are no longer able to change a situation, you are challenged to change yourself — to grow beyond the unchangeable. And that changes everything… If you feel a like you’ve wasted too much time on one or more of the points above, this quick actionable closing exercise is for YOU. Choose any area in your life that you want to improve, and then: Yes, it’s your turn to not fall back into your old patterns of living simply because they’re more comfortable and easier to access. It’s your turn to remember that you’re leaving certain habits and situations behind for a reason: to improve your life — because you can’t move forward if you keep going back. And, it’s undoubtedly your turn to reclaim your time and make it count going forward! But before you go, please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this essay.

We all exist. The question is: Do you live? Throughout a decade of life, relationship, and small business coaching, Angel and I have witnessed people reinventing themselves at all ages — 48-year-olds starting families, 57-year-olds graduating from college for the first time, 71-year-olds starting successful businesses, and so forth. How did they do it? They insisted on making gradual progress in their lives. Obviously though, it can take some time to get yourself into the right rhythm. And I am no exception. About 20 years ago I had an intervention with myself. I sat down at the local library on a Saturday morning and read through hundreds of archived entries in my journal. Specifically, I was looking for all the unfulfilled goals and visions for the future that I had jotted down over the years. It didn’t take long before I realized that the entire course my life had taken up to that point had been the product of other people’s demands, opinions, and decisions. Every day I was just going through the motions, and doing what I was “supposed” to do, instead of what was right for me. Fast forward to today, and as I awoke this morning, I marveled at my life. Where once I awoke with dread at the thought of a new day, now I awake with excitement to begin — grateful to be doing what I’m doing with my life. I’m so grateful I did what I had to do, struggled forward through the tough times, and realigned my life with the activities and values that make me feel alive. I tell you this because I know life can be crazy at times. Some seasons of our lives get so busy or stressful that we get stuck in a debilitating cycle of simply reacting to the people and circumstances around us. And in doing so we forget how important it is to listen to ourselves too. But I’m happy to tell you that things can change if you want them to, in any season and at any age. Again, just as I’ve turned things around for myself, I also know dozens of other people who have done the same at various ages and stages of life. What we have in common is that each of us insisted on making ourselves a priority, we insisted that it wasn’t too late to start making positive changes, and we followed through one day at a time. So what you need to remember most right now is that positive change in your life is dependent on what you do from this day forward, and that there are some things in life you have to insist on doing no matter what others say about it, or what they demand from you. For instance, you have to… Most of us are not raised to actively seek our calling. We may not even know that we have one. As kids, we are seldom told we have a place in life that is uniquely ours alone. Instead, we are encouraged to believe that our life should somehow fulfill the expectations of others — that we should find our happiness and success exactly as they have found theirs. Rather than being taught to ask ourselves who we are, we are trained to ask others for permission. We are, in effect, schooled to live other people’s versions of our lives. As the weeks roll into years, nearly every day of our lives is designed and developed by other people’s demands or opinions. And then one day when we break free to survey our dreams, seeking to fulfill ourselves, we see that most of our dreams have gone unfulfilled because we believed, and those around us believed, that what we wanted for ourselves was somehow impractical or beyond our reach. It’s time to unlearn these falsehoods and make changes. It takes courage to grow wiser and become who you really are. And today is the first day of the rest of your life. Every time you subtract negative from your life, you make room for more positive. Let that sink in. When things aren’t adding up in your life, begin subtracting. Life gets a lot simpler and more enjoyable when you clear the emotional and physical clutter that makes it unnecessarily complicated. And there’s so much you can let go of in life without losing a thing. It’s called growth. Letting go of the old makes way for the new. Letting go of what isn’t working makes way for what will. When the pain of holding on is worse than the pain of letting go, it’s time to let go and grow. In other words, start subtracting… the habits, routines, rituals, and circumstances that are holding you back. You cannot discover new oceans unless you build up enough courage to lose sight of the old, familiar shoreline. Be brave. Follow your values. Make changes. Dare to be different. And don’t be afraid to like it! (Read A New Earth.) Remember, there’s a big difference between empty fatigue and gratifying exhaustion. Life is too short. Invest daily in meaningful activities. Don’t wait around! Too often we wait because we think we need to “find” something new or different to be passionate about. But that’s not true. If you want more passion in your life right now, act accordingly right now. Put your whole heart and soul into the next thing you do. Not into tomorrow’s opportunities, but the opportunity right in front of you. Not into tomorrow’s tasks, but today’s tasks. Not into tomorrow’s run, but today’s run. Not into tomorrow’s conversations, but today’s conversations… In the end, purpose is the reason you journey and passion is the fire that lights your way. So learn to believe in your heart that you’re meant to live each day full of purpose and passion — that each and every moment is worthy in its own way. I’m absolutely certain you have plenty in your life right now that’s worth your time, energy, and passionate focus. You have people and circumstances in your life that need you as much as you need them. You have a massive reservoir of passionate potential within you, just waiting. Stop waiting! There is no tomorrow. Put your heart and soul into what you’ve got right in front of you! Become it, let it become you, and great things will happen FOR you, TO you, and BECAUSE of you. Many great things can be done in a day if you don’t always make that day tomorrow. Take positive action and plant the right seeds in your life right now. Nature herself does not distinguish between what seeds she receives. She grows whatever seeds are planted. This is the way life works. Be mindful of the seeds you plant today, as they will become the crop you harvest tomorrow. Will it be easy? No. But remember that when you’re struggling to make progress, that’s when you actually are. You want to be stretched to the edge of your ability at least once a day; it needs to be hard and uncomfortable for a little while. Of course, most of us don’t want to be uncomfortable, so we subconsciously run from the possibility of discomfort. The obvious problem with this is that, by running from discomfort, we are constrained to partake in only the opportunities within our comfort zones. And since our comfort zones are relativity small, we miss out on most of life’s greatest and healthiest experiences, and we get stuck in a debilitating cycle. We keep doing what we’ve always done, and thus we keep getting the results we’ve always gotten. And our true potential falls by the wayside. Choose differently starting today! Go to environments that expand your mind. Spend time with people who inspire you to stretch yourself. Read books. Grow. Get better. Your life is mostly your choice. (Note: Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the Success and Productivity chapters of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.) If it happens, be sure to tune out the cheap shots people take at you. Don’t waste words on people who deserve your silence. Sometimes the most powerful thing you can say is nothing at all. So before you waste it on anger, spite, or frustration, think of how precious and irreplaceable your time is, and carry on with grace. When Angel and I first started writing on this blog, I’d agonize over whether people would think what I was writing was good enough. I desperately hoped they’d like it, and oftentimes I’d catch myself imagining they didn’t. Then one day I realized how much energy I was wasting worrying about it. So I’ve gradually learned to relax with simply not knowing. Some problems in life, such as not knowing what others think of you, are not really meant to be resolved. What you need to remember is that you can’t control how other people feel, or how they receive your energy. Anything you do or say gets filtered through a mindset occupied by whatever they are going through at the moment, which likely has nothing to do with you. Just keep doing your thing with as much love and passion as possible. “Human” is the only real label we are born with, yet we forget so easily. To become attached to a loaded label of overweight, divorced, diseased, rejected, or poor, is to be like the rain, that doesn’t know it is also the clouds… or the ice, that forgets it is water. For we are far more than the shape we’re currently in. And we, like the wind, water, and sky, will change forms many times in our lives, while forever remaining beautifully human. So forgive yourself for the bad decisions you made, for the times you lacked understanding, for the choices that accidentally hurt others and yourself. Forgive yourself, for being young and reckless. These are all vital lessons. And what matters most right now is your willingness to grow from them. Once we forgive ourselves and fully embrace our humanness, it’s almost funny to see how seamlessly we can adapt to life’s transitions — how we outgrow what we once thought we couldn’t live without, and then we fall in love with what we didn’t even know we wanted. Take this to heart. And don’t forget to pause on a regular basis to appreciate how far you’ve come. You’ve been through a lot, and you’ve grown a lot too. Give yourself credit for the steps you’ve taken, so you can step forward again, and again. In the end, all the small things make a big difference. Every step is crucial. Life isn’t about a single moment of great triumph and attainment. It’s about the trials and errors that slowly get you there — the blood, sweat, tears, and the small, inconsequential things you do on a day-to-day basis. It all matters in the end — every step, every regret, every decision, every minor setback and minuscule win. The seemingly useless happenings add up to something. The minimum-wage job you had in high school. The evenings you spent socializing with coworkers you never see anymore. The hours you spent writing thoughts on a personal blog that no one reads. Contemplations about elaborate future plans that never came to be. All those lonely nights spent reading novels and news columns and comic strips, questioning your own principles on life and sex and religion and whether or not you’re good enough just the way you are. All of this has strengthened you. All of this has led you to every success you’ve ever had. All of this has made you who you are today. And all of this proves that you have the strength to deal with the challenges in front of you. So keep giving yourself grace, and carry on. (Note: “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts and Reflections to Start Every Day” is a great tool for this kind of self-reflection.) Yes, it’s your turn to insist on making yourself a priority today! Start by admitting to yourself that you’ve spent a lot of your life subconsciously shrinking yourself. Thinking you’re not enough. Wishing to be someone different. Someone who fits in, who’s less sensitive, or unsure, or flawed. Someone who is less YOU. Because you felt kinda broken and didn’t want to scare people away. You wanted people to like you. You wanted to be seen as worthy so you could feel healed and whole. And for the longest time, behind a facade of fake smiles, you have inadvertently betrayed yourself for the purpose of pleasing everyone else. And for longest time, your heart has ached… But you’re seeing things differently today, right? Shrinking yourself just doesn’t make sense anymore. And more than that, you now realize no matter what you do or how you change, some people will never agree with you anyway, and some situations will never nurture your soul. You now realize you have to start doing things for the right reasons. Not because it’s what everyone else says it right, but because you now know yourself to be worthy of your own priorities and values. You may have been beaten down by adversity, or sidetracked by past failures, but you are not broken. So don’t let anything or anyone else convince you otherwise. Heal yourself by refusing to shrink yourself… Insist on embracing the reminders in this essay today. Insist on getting out there and choosing yourself for all the right reasons!

Photo by: Elena 10 Wake-Up Calls People Receive Too Late in Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/life-lessons-too-late.jpg?resize=500%2C332&ssl=1| There is a big difference between empty fatigue and gratifying exhaustion. Life is too short not to focus more on what matters most. Before you know it you’ll be asking, “How did it get so late so soon?” So take time to figure yourself out. Take time to realize what you want and need. Take time to take calculated risks. Take time to love, laugh, cry, learn, and forgive. Life is so much shorter than it often seems. In our line of work we speak with people on a weekly basis who have been forced to ‘wake up’ to life’s fleeting nature. Consider these two excerpts from people’s stories that we recently received in our email inbox (both are being shared with permission): These people’s stories are both inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time. And yet, they are incredibly common stories. Wake-up calls to life being short eventually ring true in every one of our lives, sometimes much sooner than we had expected. Which is precisely why Marc and I try to remind people to stop waiting. Now is the time to start learning, growing, and moving forward — so at the very least, you can rest free of regrets someday like the dad in the second story. Remember, too many people wait all day for 5pm, all week for Friday, all year for the holidays, all their lives for happiness… And that YOU don’t have to be one of them! Don’t wait until your life is almost over to realize how good it has been, or how much potential you had literally every step of the way. It’s time to wake up! Here are ten quick wake-up calls you need to receive today, before it’s too late: Your real life is not between the moments of your birth and death. Your real life is between now and your next breath. The present — the here and now — is all the life you ever truly get. So practice living each moment in full, in kindness and peace, without fear and regret. And do the best you can with what you have in this moment; because that is all you can ever expect of anyone, including yourself. (Read The Power of Now.) Eighty years isn’t guaranteed. Many people get far less. Again, today is your life and you’ve got to fight for it! Fight for what’s right. Fight for what you believe in. Fight for what’s important to you. Fight for the people you love, and never forget to tell them how much they mean to you. Realize that right now you’re lucky because you still have a chance. So stop for a moment and think. Whatever you still need to do, start doing it today — take the next step. There are only so many tomorrows. When it comes to working hard to achieve a dream — earning a degree, building a business, or any other personal achievement that takes time and commitment — one thing you have to ask yourself is: “Am I willing to live a few years of my life like many people won’t, so I can spend the rest of my life like many people can’t?” Let that sink in. May your dreams be bigger than your fears. May your actions speak louder than words. May your life preach louder than your lips… and may success be your noise in the end. But when you are proactive and productive, it’s as if yesterday is a kind friend that helps take a load off your back. So do something right now that your future self will thank you for. Trust me, tomorrow you’ll be happy you started today. (Note: Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the Success chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Good things come to those who still hope even though they’ve been disappointed, to those who still believe even though they’ve tasted failure, to those who still love even though they’ve been hurt. So give yourself grace, and grow from the situations that didn’t work out. Remind yourself that you can disappoint people and still be good enough. You can fail and still be smart, capable and talented. You can let people down and still be worthwhile and deserving of love and admiration. We all make mistakes sometimes. Take a deep breath. You are allowed to be human, and learn the way on the way. Sometimes we try to show the world we are flawless in hopes that we will be liked and accepted by everyone, but we can’t please everyone and we shouldn’t try. The beauty of us lies in our vulnerability, our complex emotions, and our authentic imperfections. When we embrace who we are and decide to be authentic, instead of who we think others want us to be, we open ourselves up to real relationships, real happiness, and real success. So nurture the relationship you have with yourself today. You are GOOD enough, SMART enough, FINE enough, and STRONG enough. You don’t need other people to validate you; you are already VALUABLE. You’re going to come across people in your life who will say all the right words at all the right times; but in the end, it’s always their actions you should judge them by. So pay attention to what people do. Their actions will tell you almost everything you need to know. And remember that today is too important to waste. Count your blessings, value the people who truly matter, and move on from the drama with your head held high. Remind yourself that the strongest sign of your growth is knowing you’re no longer bothered by the trivial things that once used to drain you. Just keep reminding yourself that everyone you see around you is a human being who dreams of something, fears something, loves someone, and has lost someone. And… just keep being kind. Kindness is the only investment that never fails in the long run. And wherever there is a human being, there’s an opportunity for kindness. Learn to give, even if it’s just a smile, not because you have too much, but because you understand there are so many others who feel like they have nothing at all. You trip and you fall, you make mistakes and you fail, but you stand strong through it all — you live and you learn. You’re human, not perfect. You been wounded, not defeated. Think of what a priceless gift it is to grow through these experiences — to breathe, to think, to struggle, and to overcome challenges in the pursuit of the things you love. Yes, sometimes you will encounter heartache along the way, but that’s a small price to pay for immeasurable moments of love and joy. Which is why you must keep stepping forward even when it hurts, because you know the inner strength that has carried you this far can carry you the rest of the way. Recently, when Marc and I asked his 80-year-old dad about overcoming pain, this is how he explained it to us: Look at the circles below. The black circles represent our relative life experiences. Mine is larger because I am older and have experienced more in my lifetime. The smaller red circles represent a negative event in our lives. Assume we both experienced the same exact event, whatever the nature. Notice that the negative event circles are the same size for each of us; but also notice what percentage of the area they occupy in each of the black circles. Your negative event seems much larger to you because it is a greater percentage of your total life experiences. I am not diminishing the importance of this event; I simply have a different perspective on it. What you need to understand is that an overwhelmingly painful event in your life right now will one day be part of your much larger past and not nearly as significant as it seems.  Yes, it’s your turn to make the best of what’s in front of you today! So I hope you will have another inspired day today, that you will dream boldly and dangerously, that you will make some progress that didn’t exist before you took action, that you will love and be loved in return, and that you will find the strength to accept and grow from the troubles you can’t change. And, most importantly (because I think there should be more kindness and wisdom in this world), that you will, when you must, be wise with your decisions, and that you will always be extra kind to yourself and others. And please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this post. Your feedback is important to us.  🙂 (Finally, if you haven’t done so already, be sure to sign-up for our free newsletter to receive new articles like this in your inbox each week.) Photo by: Nattu "
"10 Things to Remember When Everything You Want is Out of Reach|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-things-out-of-reach.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| Tears shed for another person are not a sign of weakness; they are a sign of a pure, loving heart. We all know deep down that life is short, and that death will happen to all of us eventually, and yet we are infinitely shocked when it happens to someone we love.  It’s like walking up a flight of stairs with a distracted mind, and misjudging the final step.  You expected there to be one more stair than there is, and so you find yourself off balance for a moment, before your mind shifts back to the present moment and how the world really is. Angel and I have dealt with the loss of siblings and best friends to illness, so we know from experience that when you lose someone you can’t imagine living without, your heart breaks wide open.  And the bad news is you never completely get over the loss – you will never forget them.  However, in a backwards way, this is also the good news. You see, death is an ending, which is a necessary part of living.  And even though endings like these often seem ugly, they are necessary for beauty too – otherwise it’s impossible to appreciate someone or something, because they are unlimited.  Limits illuminate beauty, and death is the definitive limit – a reminder that we need to be aware of this beautiful person, and appreciate this beautiful thing called life.  Death is also a beginning, because while we have lost someone special, this ending, like the loss of any wonderful life situation, is a moment of reinvention.  Although sad, their passing forces us to reinvent our lives, and in this reinvention is an opportunity to experience beauty in new, unseen ways and places.  And finally, of course, death is an opportunity to celebrate a person’s life, and to be grateful for the beauty they showed us. That’s just a small slice of what coping with loss has taught us, and I’m sure it has taught you some things as well. But, as Angel and I have recently been reminded, there’s a big difference between understanding how to personally cope with loss and understanding how to help someone else cope with it.  When someone you love and respect is grieving the loss of a loved one, the right words and gestures rarely come easy. So the reminders below are for Angel and me, as we attempt to comfort a dear friend who is grieving.  These aren’t universal clarifications, but simple guidelines that give us a general starting point for helping our grief-stricken loved ones cope and heal, gradually.  Perhaps you will find value in them as well. When you’re grieving, everyone wants to remind you that time will heal your pain, but no one can seem to tell you exactly what you’re supposed to do and how you’re supposed to cope right now.  And that’s all you really want to know. Because it’s right now that you can’t sleep.  It’s right now that you can’t eat.  It’s right now that you still hear his voice, and smell his scent, and sense his presence, even though you know he’s not here anymore.  It’s right now that all you seem to be capable of is crying.  So despite the fact that you intellectually know all about time’s power to heal wounds, if you had all the time in the world right now, you still wouldn’t know what to do with the immediate, intense pain you feel. Realize this, and treat those who are grieving accordingly.  Don’t remind them that time heals.  Instead, remind them that you’re with them right now, and that you’ll be available tomorrow too.  Remind them that you love them, and that you’re standing beside them through their grief.  Remind them that they aren’t going through this alone. When someone you love passes away (or simply leaves), and you’re not expecting it, you don’t lose them all at once.  You lose them a little bit at a time over weeks, months and years – the way snail mail gradually stops coming to an address, and a person’s scent slowly fades from the pillows and even from the clothes they used to wear. Everyone grieves in their own way.  For some of us, it could take longer or shorter.  One thing you can be certain of, however, is that grief never completely disappears.  An ember still smolders inside our grieving hearts, even when we’ve moved forward with our lives.  Most days we don’t notice it, but, out of the blue, it may flare to life.  This reality is hard to deal with.  We think we’ve accepted that they’re gone – that we’ve grieved and it’s over – and then BOOM!  One little thing happens, and we feel like we’ve lost that person all over again. This is exactly why caring for someone who’s grieving requires incredible patience.  (Read Healing After Loss.) Relentless exhaustion is a common side effect of grief.  Just getting out of bed in the morning can be an overwhelming and excruciating experience for a while.  Also, someone suffering from grief may feel OK one moment and feel completely heartbroken the next, even if the environment around them hasn’t changed one bit.  This can result in them canceling plans, departing get-togethers early, or saying no far more often than you’d like.  Just remember it’s not about you – it has nothing to do with what you did or didn’t do.  These are just some of the prevalent side effects working through the grieving process. Do your best to not take anything they do too personally.  People can only give to others what they have, and deep grief takes almost everything away from a person.  All your actions and words should come from a place of love, but that doesn’t mean your grieving loved one will always be loving in return, and that’s OK.  When you do not take things personally, you liberate yourself – you open yourself to loving someone who truly needs you, generously, and without letting needless expectations get in the way of the immeasurable amounts of support and affection you are capable of giving.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) In the long run, grief can devour us, or it can enlighten us.  It depends on what we focus on.  We can decide that a relationship was all for nothing if it had to end earlier than we expected, or we can recognize that every single moment of it had more meaning than we dared to accept at the time – so much meaning it frightened us, so we just lived, just took for granted the time spent together every day, and didn’t allow ourselves to consider the sacredness of it. When a wonderful relationship ends abruptly we suddenly see what was there all along – it wasn’t just a hug and a smile, not just a long walk together, not just meeting for lunch and talking about politics, people, and another day at work.  It was EVERYTHING – all the little intricacies of life shared by two souls.  The answer to the mystery of living is the love and respect we share sometimes so imperfectly, and when the loss awakens us to the deeper beauty of it, to the sanctity of a wonderful relationship that’s been lost, we’re driven to our knees. When this happens to someone you love – when they are mourning the loss of someone they love – help them focus on all those good, imperfect times worth smiling about.  Help them counterbalance the weight of their loss with the weight of their gratitude for what preceded the loss. As human beings, we sometimes get used to the weight of grief and how it holds us in place.  For instance, Angel once told me, “My brother will die over and over again for the rest of my life, and I’m OK with that – it keeps me closer to him.”  This was Angel’s way of reminding me that grief doesn’t disappear.  Step-by-step, breath-by-breath, it becomes a part of us.  And it can become a healthy part of us too. Although we may never completely stop grieving, simply because we never stop loving the ones we’ve lost, we can effectively leverage our love for them in the present.  We can love them and emulate them by living with their magnificence as our daily inspiration.  By doing this, they live on in the warmth of our broken hearts that don’t fully heal back up, and we will continue to grow and experience life, even with our wounds.  It’s like badly breaking an ankle that never heals perfectly, and that still hurts when you dance, but you dance anyway with a slight limp, and this limp just adds to the depth of your performance and the authenticity of your character. Just knowing this and keeping it in mind, I think, can help us help our grieving loved ones dance again, gradually.  (Angel and I build gradual, grief-healing rituals with our students in the “Pain and Hardship” module of Getting Back to Happy.)

Because asking the right questions today is the answer. It’s a harsh fact that every one of us is ignorant in some way. Although we tend to pretend otherwise, it’s impossible to know it all. Ignorance is our biggest collective secret. And it’s one of the scariest and most damaging realities of life, because those of us who are most ignorant — and thus most likely to spread ignorance — are often the ones who don’t know it. Here’s a quick test: If you have never changed your mind about one of your beliefs, if you have never questioned the fundamentals of your opinions, and if you have no inclination to do so, then you are likely ignorant about something you think you understand. What’s the immediate solution? Just move one step outside of your social bubble and find someone (online or offline) who, in your opinion, believes, behaves, or handles certain aspects of life differently from you. Then, have a simple, honest, peaceful conversation with them. I promise it will do both of you lots of good. Once you’ve done that, here are some key truths to remind yourself of on a regular basis: Now, it’s your turn… To be present and have patience with everything that remains unexplained in your heart and mind. To engage with people today, including those who think differently. To ask questions. To listen closely. To not just grow in knowledge, but to also be a person who gives back. To let your questions guide you, and then use what you’re learning to make a difference. Which point mentioned above resonates with you the most today, and why?

How to Begin Again After an Unexpected Ending|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/how-to-begin-again.jpg?resize=500%2C281&ssl=1| As you struggle forward in the days and weeks ahead, remind yourself, it is far better to be exhausted from lots of effort, learning and growth, than it is to be tired of doing absolutely nothing. In 1914, the great inventor Thomas Edison experienced a devastating hardship. His entire laboratory burned down to the ground, and several years worth of his work was ruined. Newspapers described the situation as “the worst thing to happen to Edison!” But that wasn’t true, because Edison didn’t see it that way at all. The inventor instead chose to see his circumstances as an invigorating opportunity to rebuild and re-examine much of his current work. In fact, Edison reportedly said shortly after the fire, “Thank goodness all our mistakes were burned up. Now we can start again fresh.” And that’s exactly what he and his team did. Think about how this relates to your life. How many times have you heard it was the end, when it was really the beginning? How many hopeless labels have been slapped over your inner hope? Probably more often than you realize. The truth is, life’s “fires” happen to all of us. We all go through circumstances, big and small, that deeply effect us, and… Yet, a great deal of our pain exists entirely in our minds. When we attach ourselves to ideals and fantasies about how reality has to be in order to be good enough for us, we only make matters worse. So, are you ready to follow Edison’s lead and live better despite your circumstances? It’s time to… You can have a heartbreaking story from the past without letting it rule your present. In the present moment we all have some kind of pain: anger, sadness, frustration, disappointment, regret, etc. Notice this pain within yourself, watch it closely, and see that it’s caused by whatever story you have in your head about what happened in the past (either in the recent past or in the distant past). Your mind might insist that the pain you feel is caused by what happened (not by the story in your head about it), but what happened in the past is NOT happening right now. It’s over. It has passed. But the pain is still happening right now because of the story you’ve been subconsciously telling yourself about that past incident. Note that “story” does not mean “fake story.” It also does not mean “true story.” The word “story” in the context of your self-evaluation doesn’t have to imply true or false, positive or negative, or any other kind of forceful judgment call. It’s simply a process that’s happening inside your head: So just notice what story you have, without judging it, and without judging yourself. It’s natural to have a story; we all have stories. See yours for what it is. And see that it’s causing you pain. Then do your best to change your response. Start by simply bringing your attention to the present moment. Focus on what’s here with you now—the light, the sounds, your body, the ground under your feet, the objects and people moving and resting around you. Don’t judge these things against what they should be—just accept what they actually are. Because once you accept reality, you can improve upon it. See life as it is, without all the ideals and fantasies you’ve been preoccupied with… Recently, COVID-19 has been one of the primary reasons so many of us are preoccupied. The new normal we’ve been forced to live through has been quite confining both mentally and physically. Everything basically changed overnight, leaving us yearning for the good old days. Yes, so much has been postponed, closed or canceled recently. But not everything. And it’s important to bring this into your present awareness. Love has not been postponed, closed or canceled. Hope has not been postponed, closed or canceled. Self-care has not been postponed, closed or canceled. Right now there are plenty of opportunities to invest in the little things that matter most. The key is to not let life’s difficulties cloud your vision. Think about the most gut-wrenching situations you’ve endured in your past. Doing so likely brings up some very uncomfortable feelings. And the associated attachments you have may stir anxiety, anger or sadness. This is a predicament many of us face. Now imagine how you would feel if you were able to get over these feelings. By “get over” I mean no longer suffering over something that can’t be controlled. I know this is possible because Marc and I have both personally come to peace with extremely difficult, heartbreaking, uncontrollable situations in our past, and we’ve witnessed hundreds of our students and Think Better, Live Better seminar attendees do the same. So what’s the secret? There isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer, but all of the possible answers start with releasing your judgments. The truth is, it’s impossible to get over a difficult situation—to let it go—if you’re still obsessively judging it and comparing it to something else. Let’s revisit one specific gut-wrenching situation from your past again—choose one that still stirs negative emotions. And then ask yourself: If you caught yourself thinking “yes” to one or more of those questions, then what’s prolonging your suffering and preventing you from getting over it is judgment. Your judgments about what “should have happened” continues to postpone the love, hope, and self-care you know you are capable of practicing. Now you may be thinking, “What happened was unbelievably horrible! I can’t conceive of ever getting over it!” But releasing your judgment does not mean you’re pleased with what happened, or that you support it, but rather that you are eliminating the negative burden you are carrying by perpetually judging it. When you let go of your negative judgments, you automatically replace the victim mentality with acceptance and presence. And acceptance and presence together will free your mind and move you forward. This very same principle applies to our present challenges with COVID-19, especially for those of us who are not ill. When we think better about our circumstances, we live better in spite of them. And there is no reason to postpone. Now is the time to practice. Of course, this might also require you to… Perhaps you know someone who actually has grown ill from COVID-19. Or, even more heart-wrenching, perhaps you’ve lost someone you love. When truly dire circumstances blindside us, grief often sets in. And it takes time to settle. But grieving is a healthy process that allows us to begin again after an unexpected ending. Now, you may have heard that it isn’t healthy to grieve for too long—that doing so gets in the way healing. I say this because it’s something I was taught when I was a teenager. A close friend died in a car accident. At first everyone accepted my tears, but as the weeks rolled into months, I was frequently told that it was time to let go. “The tears aren’t helping at this point,” I remember someone telling me. But that was hogwash. My tears were necessary. They were slowly watering the seeds of my recovery. And I recovered as a much stronger, kinder, and wiser soul than I ever was before. Then, a decade later, this lesson was reinforced in my life two more times, back-to-back, when I lost my older brother, Todd, to suicide and my best friend, Josh, to an Asthma attack, a month apart. Through the grief of losing people I love, I have been given the gift of awareness… awareness that every one of us will lose someone or something we love, and that this reality is a necessary one. It’s incredibly tough to comprehend at times, but there’s a small reason for everything. We must know the pain of loss, because if we never knew it, we would have little compassion for others and we would gradually become hollow monsters of egoism—creatures of sheer self-interest, never being happy with what we have. The awful pain of loss teaches humility to our prideful kind, has the power to warm-up a cold heart, and make an even better person out of a good one. So yes, grief can be a burden that devastates us in the near-term, but it can also be a healthy anchor for healing and living well in the long run. As human beings, we often get used to the weight of grief and how it holds us in place. For instance, I often say, “My brother will die over and over again for the rest of my life, and I’m OK with that—it keeps me closer to him.” This is my way of reminding others that grief doesn’t disappear. Step-by-step, breath-by-breath, it becomes a part of us. And it can become a healthy part of us too. Although we may never completely stop grieving, simply because we never stop loving the ones (or the situations) we’ve lost, we can effectively leverage our love for them in the present. We can love them and emulate them by living with their magnificence as our daily inspiration. By doing this, they live on in the warmth of our broken hearts that don’t fully heal back up, and we will continue to grow and experience life, even with our wounds. It’s like badly breaking an ankle that never heals perfectly, and that still hurts when you dance, but you dance anyway with a slight limp, and this limp just adds to the depth of your performance and the authenticity of your character. (Marc and I build small, life-changing rituals for coping in the Adversity module of the Getting Back to Happy Course.) Regardless of your circumstances, you can find the strength to ask: “How can I respond from a place of clarity and strength today, rather than continuing to react in anger and resistance to the painful experiences I’ve been forced to live through?” Think about that question for a moment. Read it again, and sit with it. Every time you are tempted to react in the same old way, pause for a few seconds, take a few deep breaths, and make space for a healthy change of state—for something new to enter… It’s time to consciously redirect your focus by taking it away from something unchangeable that drags you down, and instead zero it in on something small and actionable that moves you forward in the present moment. Nothing is stopping you right now—nothing is holding you back but your own thoughts and reactions to “how life is.” Of course, you may not be responsible for everything that happened to you in the past, or everything that’s happening to you today, but you need to be responsible for undoing the thinking and behavioral patterns these circumstance create. It’s about thinking better so you can ultimately live better. Truly, the greatest weapon you have against pain is your ability to pause, breathe, and choose one present response over another—to train your mind to make the best of what you’ve got in front of you, even when it’s far less than you expected. YOU CAN change the way you think and respond. And once you do, you can master a new way to be. The bottom line is that life will get better when YOU get better. Start investing in yourself mentally and physically from this moment forward. Choose a fresh response! Make it a priority to learn and grow a little bit every day by building positive rituals and sticking to them. The stronger you grow and become, the better your life will feel in the long run.

Life gets a lot simpler when you clear the clutter that makes it complicated. It’s time to focus on what matters, and let go of what does not. For almost a decade now, Marc and I have been learning to do just that—live a simpler life. Not simpler as in “meager.” Simpler as in “meaningful.” We’ve been working on eliminating many of life’s complexities so we’re able to spend more time with people we love and do more activities we love. This means we’ve been gradually getting rid of mental and physical clutter, and eliminating all but the essential, so we’re left with only that which gives us value. Our overarching goal is living a life uncluttered by most of the things people fill their lives with, leaving us with space for what truly matters. A life that isn’t constant busyness, rushing and stress, but instead contemplation, creation and connection with people and projects we love. Of course, that doesn’t mean we have zero clutter and complications. We’re human and living in the real world with everyone else. We have a home, possessions, computers, gadgets, distractions and occasional busyness. But we have reduced it to make space. Today, after finishing up a call with a new course student who’s working diligently to simplify various aspects of her life and business, I’ve been reflecting on this simpler life Marc and I have created for ourselves, and I thought I’d share some of these reflections with you. Some lessons I’ve learned about living a simpler life: For the cynics out there who might say the list of lessons above is too long to be “simpler,” there are really only two steps to simplifying: Of course, that advice is not exceptionally useful unless you understand how to apply it to various areas of your life… which is why I gave you the lessons above. Please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this post. Your feedback is important to us.  ?

"1 Sign it’s Finally Time to Take a Step Forward Again (and How to Get Started)|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/1-sign-step-forward-again.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| If it entertains you now but will actually hurt you someday, it’s a distraction. Don’t settle. Don’t exchange what you need in the long run for what you kinda want at the moment. Study your habits. Determine where your time goes. Delete the toxic distractions. Taking small steps can make a big difference, especially in tough times, but there’s no getting around the fact that taking these steps is often incredibly uncomfortable. That’s why so many people often don’t do it—at least not initially. But we have to catch ourselves, and remind ourselves that just because it isn’t easy doesn’t mean it isn’t worth it. The key is to remember that it’s okay to feel uncomfortable, because that’s where human growth and healing begins. In order to get something in life, we often have to give something up. In order to change our situation for the better, we have to take some action that’s not necessarily going to be easy or fun. Life is the opposite of perfection. It can be beautiful, of course, but it’s obviously quite messy and chaotic at times. Too often we shy away from taking the next step because we’re afraid it might not be worth the discomfort. It’s scary and uncomfortable to upset the status quo, even when it’s in service of something better. It all comes down to a single question: what is worth suffering for right now? Is the change you’re wanting to implement—finding a new job, reinventing yourself or your business, ending a relationship, or something else—truly going to help you move toward the life you want to lead in the weeks and months ahead? If so, then it’s a sign that it’s time to step forward, and it’s probably worth enduring some extra pain and discomfort to get there. You can also rephrase the question to help you think through it: How important is moving forward to you? And what are you willing to sacrifice, in the short term and long term, in order to be happier in the long term? By questioning your situation like this, you’ll realize that there are great reasons to step out of your comfort zone and to suffer. Changes of this magnitude do not come easily for any of us—especially as we collectively deal with the realities of COVID-19—and we understand that. But once you start to have an honest conversation with yourself about what you want to change in your life going forward, you’ll find it easier to direct your full energy toward overcoming your present obstacles. When you’re focused on all the good that will come from making the change you desire, the sacrifices you’ll have to make to achieve that change simply won’t seem as big a deal. In any case, adapting to change, and getting unstuck from an unhappy or unhealthy present situation, is fundamentally about becoming comfortable with discomfort. It’s about choosing to embrace that discomfort, not because you want to make your life overly complicated or difficult, but because there are some things that are worth suffering for. It’s about suffering a little bit more in the moment, in order to suffer a lot less in the long run. It’s about giving certain things up right now to get more of what you truly want in life in the weeks and months ahead! No doubt, if you want those six-pack abs again, you also have to want the hard workouts and the healthy meals. If you want the successful business again, you also have to want the long days, the stressful business deals and decisions, and the possibility of failing five times to learn what you need to know to succeed in the post COVID-19 market. If you want to reinvent your life and adapt well to a “new normal” starting now, you simply have to give up certain ideals, comforts, routines, and so on, to get what you ultimately want. And remember that giving things up isn’t just about making small, immediate sacrifices. It’s also about gradually gaining the resources you need to do something significant going forward. When you give something up, you automatically create an opening in your life for something else. By saying no to everything that’s not aligned with your priorities, or the present reality, you make room for what is. In other words, if you want to achieve a significant outcome in your life in the weeks and months ahead, you have to give up the things that conflict with it starting today. You have to sacrifice something that you value less than whatever you ultimately want to achieve. Eleven years ago, when our mutual best friend Josh died, as difficult as the news of his death was to swallow, Angel and I intellectually knew nothing would bring him back. But it still felt emotionally easiest to get lost in our grief and mull over the idea of never losing him—far easier than actually confronting what his loss meant to us. So that’s precisely what we did for a while—we fantasized about not losing him, and bringing him back—until we suffered a collective bout of moderate depression. Thankfully, in the middle of our unhealthy mourning, we caught ourselves—something needed to be done to change our outlook on the tragedy of losing him. We reached out to Cami, Josh’s widow, a person we might have easily chosen to distance ourselves from in order to shut out the pain of loss. Truthfully, we didn’t know the right things to say or do, so we simply decided to show up and listen. We realized that this might be uncomfortable for us, but it was nothing in comparison to what she was going through. So one evening, Cami, her sister, Tina, and the two of us sat around a table together. As dusk began to settle, we started speaking openly about Josh. None of us anticipated how the conversation would go. Tears were shed as we sat there, the dark falling around us, but it was our way of stepping into our loss and accepting it. When we made the decision to have that conversation about Josh, we knew what might be at stake. Confronting our loss wasn’t easy, but that moment came out of the intentional decision not to run away from thinking about Josh. What did we give up by engaging in Cami’s friendship? We gave up what was easy—fantasizing, and trying to deny his death altogether—and stepped into a place where we felt unsure. But that’s where change is built: in the uneasiness and discomfort. And out of that, we built a great relationship with somebody who mattered more than anything in the world to Josh. And Cami now works with us as an executive assistant for our business (the foundation of which is www.marcandangel.com). Changing your situation is about not sidestepping the issue or avoiding the elephant in the room. It’s about moving into uncertainty with openness and honesty, and realizing that this choice might bring with it anxiety, discomfort, and even pain. It’s about being willing to accept what comes, about being vulnerable. By being open to this kind of honesty and vulnerability, you also open yourself to a sense of renewed freedom, peace, and emotional richness that otherwise may never have entered your life. You have the power to change your situation for the better, no matter what. But again, before you can do that, you may have to give up some of the stories, ideas, ideals, and assumptions you’ve been clinging to about yourself and your current situation. Remind yourself that giving up doesn’t always mean you’re weak or wrong. Today, it simply means you’re strong enough and smart enough to let go and move forward with your life. Right now, many of us are still hopelessly trying to find our passion and joy again—an idea we believe will ultimately lead us closer to renewed happiness and success. And I say “hopelessly” primarily because we are putting the cart ahead of the horse. When we say we’re trying to “find our passion and joy,” it implies that we’ve lost our passion and joy and now they’re somehow hiding behind a tree or under a rock somewhere. But that’s far from the truth. The truth is, our passion and joy come from habitually stepping out of our comfort zones and doing things right on a daily basis. If you’re waiting to somehow “find your passion and joy” somewhere outside yourself today, so you finally have a reason to put your whole heart and soul into life again, you’ll likely be waiting around for an eternity. On the other hand, if you’re tired of waiting, and you’d rather live more passionately and joyously starting today, it’s a clear sign that it’s time to proactively inject passion into the very next thing you do. Think about it… Like most of us, you’re likely putting a half-hearted and half-minded effort into most of the things you do on a daily basis. Because you’re still waiting… You’re still waiting to “find” something to be passionate and joyous about in these “new normal” times. What you need to do is the exact opposite! When I was a kid, my grandmother used to tell me, “Stop looking for the next opportunity. The one you have in front of you is your opportunity.” She also said, “Too often we spend too much time attempting to perfect something before we ever even do it. Instead of waiting for perfection, just do your best with what you’ve got right now, and improve it along the way.” Interestingly, recent psychological research indirectly reinforces my grandmother’s sentiments. For decades psychologists thought that our minds could alter our physical state, but not the other way around. Nowadays, however, it is widely documented that our bodies—for example, our momentary facial expressions and posture—can directly affect our mental and emotional state. So while it’s true that we change from the inside out, we also change from the outside in. And you can leverage this reality in your favor right now… If you want more passion and joy in your life right now, do something about it right now. Put your heart and soul into something! Not into “the next opportunity,” but the small opportunity right in front of you. Not into tomorrow’s work, but today’s work. Not into tomorrow’s workout, but today’s workout. Not into tomorrow’s relationships, but today’s relationships. I’m certain you have plenty in your life right now that’s worth living for. You have people and lots of little circumstances you’re taking for granted. You have an endless reservoir of untapped potential within you, just waiting. Stop waiting! Do the uncomfortable things. Suffer a little to gain momentum again. There is no next opportunity, only the one you have at this moment. Give up the toxic distractions and ideals, focus on what matters most, and put your heart and soul into the opportunity directly in front of you today! Make doing so a habit and see where it leads.

Recently, so much has been postponed, closed or canceled. But not everything. Love has not been postponed, closed or canceled. Hope has not been postponed, closed or canceled. Self-care has not been postponed, closed or canceled. Right now is an opportunity to invest… in the little things that matter most. The human experience is filled with love, passion, creativity, joy, connection, compassion, laughter…and the taste of chocolate cake. But because we as human beings learn, evolve and grow through life’s ups and downs, our experience also includes plenty of difficult situations and seasons that round us out. The key right now is to not let life’s difficulties get the best of you. Think about the most gut-wrenching situations you’ve endured in your past. Doing so likely brings up some very uncomfortable feelings. And the associated attachments you have may stir anxiety, anger or sadness. This is a predicament many of us face. Now imagine how you would feel if you were able to get over these feelings. By “get over” I mean no longer suffering over something that can’t be controlled. I know this is possible because Marc and I have both personally come to peace with extremely difficult, heartbreaking, uncontrollable situations in our past, and we’ve witnessed hundreds of our students and Think Better, Live Better seminar attendees do the same. So what’s the secret? There isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer, but all of the possible answers start with… The truth is, it’s impossible to get over a difficult situation—to let it go—if you’re still obsessively judging it and comparing it to something else. Let’s revisit one specific gut-wrenching situation from your past again—choose one that still stirs negative emotions. And then ask yourself: If you caught yourself thinking “yes” to one or more of those questions, then what’s prolonging your suffering and preventing you from getting over it is judgment. Your judgments about what “should have happened” continues to postpone the love, hope, and self-care you know you are capable of practicing. Now you may be thinking, “What happened was unbelievably horrible!

When you let go of your negative judgments, you automatically replace the victim mentality with acceptance and presence. And acceptance and presence together will free your mind and move you forward. This very same principle applies to our present challenges with COVID-19, especially for those of us who are not ill. When we think better about our circumstances, we live better in spite of them. And there is no reason to postpone. Now is the time to practice being more mindful of your judgments and how you respond to life. Of course, that’s much easier said that done. Mindfulness as a daily ritual is the ultimate challenge. It’s a way of living, of being, of seeing, of tapping into the full power of your humanity, without judgment. At its core, mindfulness is… Above all, what you need to remember is that where you are and what you’re doing at any given moment is absolutely essential. Because it is the only moment guaranteed to you. You are not on your way somewhere else. You are not progressing to a more important time or place. The present is not just a stepping-stone—it is the ultimate destination. This moment is where your greatest opportunity lies. This moment is your life! It might seem obvious, but we forget more often than we’d like to admit. All day, every day, many of us feel like the present isn’t enough—like our life right now simply isn’t worthy of our full presence. And because of this, we judge it harshly and miss out on most of life’s present beauty. But what if we did the opposite? What if we accepted this moment—no matter how imperfect—as exactly enough? What if we accepted the “bad” with the good, the letdowns with the lessons, the heart-wrenching with the interesting, the anxiety with the opportunity, as part of a package deal that this moment alone is offering us? What if we paused right now, and saw everything with perfect clarity? Keep thinking about it… Would we live more meaningful and memorable lives in the days and weeks ahead? Would we have more beautiful stories to cherish and share? I think we would. And thus, I think now is the best time to practice. It takes roughly 60 days to form a new habit. So for the next eight weeks, wake up every morning and practice being less judgmental and more mindful—practice looking at the bright side of your life—and you will rewire your brain. Will you accept this challenge? Did this post resonate with you today? We would love to hear from YOU. Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

You are always growing… stronger! Sometimes life slams us in the gut, dealing us such a devastating blow it literally takes our breath away. A pandemic hits, a loved one gets ill, we lose a breadwinning job, someone we know dies, money gets tight, feelings of depression and despondency overwhelm our better judgment… everything just seems to be going wrong. So, what can we do when the world around us shatters, and we can’t seem to pick up the pieces? The times when things are falling apart are precisely the best times to practice presence and mindfulness. These are the times we’re always preparing for, in a way, when we pray, meditate, self-reflect, and generally invest in our personal growth during the good times. Truth be told, when the world seems to be crumbling, there is immense opportunity. But we must be willing to do some tough things. We must be willing to change our perspective and our response. Ready? First, let’s practice laying a solid foundation… Be patient with the pain you feel. Don’t hide from it, don’t rush to cover it up or fix it immediately. Just start by acknowledging its presence and facing it with courage. Then, challenge yourself to sit quietly with what you are feeling for a full minute, with compassion and gentleness. Be at peace with the source of your pain—find the braveness to just sit with it like you would with a close friend who’s hurting. Practice this a few times a day, whenever you feel the pulse of your pain surging. And notice when your mind wants to run, hide or rebel. When this happens, take a deep breath, re-center yourself, and begin again. Eventually, you will see clearly that what you feel is just a feeling, and that you can stay with what you feel without the world ending. You will see that you are in control of your feelings, and not the other way around. And you will begin to take them less seriously, hold them lightly, and give them some much-needed space in your worried brain. When the world is shattering, this is the time to practice. Of course, I’m certainly not downplaying the real nature of our present circumstances with COVID-19. The virus is still spreading around the world right now, and we are all facing a very difficult reality. These are not “good times.” I’m not suggesting we should rejoice at living though this disappointing and painful life experience. But it is absolutely prudent to consider the impact this event is having on our collective behavior. So, let’s build off the foundation we just set above. Let’s look at some tough yet necessary things we can do for ourselves right now to ease our pain and experience a little more happiness in the days and weeks ahead… Life is not lived in some distant, imagined land of someday where everything is perfect. It is lived here and now, with the reality of the way things are. Yes, by all means you can hope for and work toward an idealized tomorrow. Yet to do so, you must successfully deal with the world as it is today. Sometimes we avoid experiencing exactly where we are because we have developed a belief, based on past experiences, that it is not where we should be or want to be. But the truth is, where you are now is exactly where you need to be to get to where you want to go tomorrow. So practice appreciating where you are. Your family members are too beautiful to ignore. Call them. Text them. Take a moment to remember how fortunate you are to be breathing. Take a look around, with your eyes earnestly open to the possibilities. Much of what you fear does not exist in the space around you. Much of what you love is closer than you realize. You are just one brief thought away from understanding the blessing that is your life. Remind yourself that happiness is a mindset that can only be designed into the present. It’s not a point in the future or a moment from the past, and yet this misconception hurts the masses more often than we realize. So many young people seem to think all their happiness awaits them in the years ahead, while so many older people believe their best moments are behind them. COVID-19 is only exacerbating these kinds of mindsets right now. Don’t let it get the best of you. Over the years, Angel and I have guided hundreds of friends, course students and Think Better, Live Better conference attendees through a process of finding sincere gratitude and passion in tough times—a process of stepping forward gracefully, no matter what… A couple short years ago, on the second to last day of her life, a friend of mine, who I was coaching daily, told me her only regret was that she didn’t appreciate every year with the same passion and purpose that she had in the last two years of her life, after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. “I’ve accomplished so much recently—so much inner growth—and truly appreciated every moment of it,” she said. “If I had only known, I would have started sooner.” Her words made me cry and smile at the same time. What was truly miraculous was seeing the genuine gratitude in her eyes at that moment. She was immensely grateful for actually being able to accomplish the little things she had accomplished in her final two years. And her sentiment has always remained with me, and sits at the top of my mind right now. While I agree that dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic is disheartening, and that it can be very painful and debilitating for some people, the pain for most of us can still be mediated by a sense of gratitude and passion for being alive. For still having a chance to do the little things that bring us joy. For still having a life worth living, from moment to precious moment. Honestly, you’re doing it right when you have so much to cry and complain about, but you prefer to breathe deep and appreciate your life instead. Because there is always, always, always something to be thankful for and some reason to take another step forward. Just invest your heart and soul into whatever you have right in front of you. Bring gratitude and passion into otherwise ordinary moments… What if you woke up tomorrow with only the little things you were thankful for and passionate about today? About a decade ago, when I was intensely focused on weight lifting and physical strength training, I gradually learned that you can’t be truly committed to anything worthwhile if you have a weak mind that’s unwilling to do tough things. To combat this, I wrote two simple questions on two different post-it notes and stuck one on my bathroom mirror and the other inside my gym locker: To this day, the answer to both questions is surely hundreds for most people, including myself. Weakness of the mind can easily get the best of us, especially when the going gets tough. And the only way to fix this weakness is daily practice. Far too often we think inner strength is all about how we respond to extremely dire circumstances, like actively coping with Covid-19: Can we keep our lives together even after suffering from a major illness, or losing our livelihood? There’s no doubt that extremely dire circumstances test our bravery, determination and inner strength, but what about less dire, daily circumstances? Perhaps just passively coping with Covid-19 from a distance, when it’s not directly and personally debilitating us. What we need to remember is that the mind needs to be exercised to gain strength. It needs to be worked consistently in healthy ways to grow strong. If you refuse to push yourself forward a little bit every day, of course you will feel completely stuck when the going gets tough. But you don’t have to feel that way right now… Choose to do some sit-ups in your bedroom every morning when it would be easier to sleep in. Choose to do the ten reps when it would be easier to quit at nine. Choose to create something special (like a new journal entry, drawing, or family highlight video) when it would be easier to consume something mediocre on TikTok or Instagram. Choose to send loving texts to family and friends when it would be easier to watch another show on Netflix. Prove to yourself, in dozens of little ways over the next few weeks, that you have the discipline to get in the ring and wrestle with life. Inner strength is always built through lots of small, daily victories. It’s the individual choices we make day-to-day that build our “inner strength muscles.” We all want this kind of strength, especially in tough times, but we can’t simply think our way to it. If you want it, you have to do something about it ritualistically. It’s your positive daily rituals that prove your mental fortitude and move you in a positive direction. The bottom line is that as times get tougher over the next few weeks, many people will find something easy to do—they will find an easy distraction. But when things get tougher for YOU, you can join Angel and me, and find a way to stay on track with your healthy daily rituals. 🙂 (Note: Angel and I build positive, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy course.) If you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU. Which point discussed above resonates with you the most today? Anything else to share? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

One Thing We Should Start Doing Together as We Distance Ourselves From COVID-19|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/19-covid19.jpg?resize=500%2C300&ssl=1| Experiences don’t stop. That’s life. And the very experiences that seem so hard when you’re going through them are the ones you’ll look back on with gratitude for how far you’ve come. We know you’re reading this (probably from home right now). And we want you to know we’re writing this for you. Others will be confused. They will think we’re writing this for them. But we’re not. This one’s for YOU. We want you to know that life is not easy for any of us right now. Every day is an unpredictable challenge. Some days it can be difficult simply to get out of bed in the morning. To face the reality of COVID-19 and put on that smile. But we want you to know, your smile has kept us going on more days than we can count. Yes, as a reader of this little blog, YOUR SMILE—your willingness to read and empower yourself—helps us through. Never forget that, even through the toughest of times, you are incredible. You really are. So smile more often. You have so many reasons to. Time and again, our reason is you. You won’t always be perfect or act perfect. Neither will we. Because nobody is perfect, and nobody deserves to be perfect. Nobody has it easy, everybody has issues. You will never know exactly what we’re going through. And we will never know exactly what you’re going through. We are all fighting our own unique war right now. But we are fighting through it simultaneously, together. Remember, our courage doesn’t always roar aloud. Sometimes it’s the quiet voice at the end of the day whispering, “I will try my best again tomorrow.” So stand strong. Things turn out best for people who make the best out of the way things turn out. And we are committed to making the best of it along with you. As we acclimate to a world with COVID-19, let’s not just think outside the box. Let’s think like there is no box at all. Let’s ease our worried minds by tuning out the excess noise in our heads for a little while every day. It’s a perfect time to slow down after all. There’s no reason not to take our minds off (the wrong) things and find some much-needed inner peace. You know how we typically turn down the volume on the radio or TV when we need to a moment to think clearly? The same is true for all aspects of our lives in general. The noise we need to cut out first? That’s the mental noise we hear all too often—the worried thoughts screaming over our collective sanity. Turning down the radio or TV volume refocuses our minds and offers us a moment of peace and clarity when we need it most. We don’t really think about how or why this makes such a huge difference, we just know it does. So, now it’s time to apply this same strategy to all the other noise in our present lives, starting with the noise in our collective consciousness. And although it’s not quite as easy as spinning the radio’s or TV’s volume dial, the good news is we can quiet our minds and train ourselves to think more peacefully and rationally simply by reminding ourselves to do so every day. The best tool for the job while we’re distancing ourselves inside our homes? It’s just a simple practice of self-reflection that can keep us on track by keeping peaceful, productive thoughts at the top of our minds, even as we cope with all the COVID-19 related noise and chaos surrounding us. Consider this short excerpt from our newest volume of 1000+ Little Things Happy Successful People Do Differently: “When you want to get somewhere in life, you need a map, and your journal is that map. You can write down what you did today, what you tried to accomplish, where you made mistakes, and so much more. It’s a place to reflect. It’s a place to capture important thoughts and eliminate the rest. It’s a place to sort out where you’ve been and where you intend to go. And it’s one of the most underused, yet incredibly effective tools available to the masses.” If you’re interested in journaling with Angel and me, as we distance ourselves from COVID-19 over the next few weeks, I’ve listed 21 journal prompts below that we are personally using to take our minds off things and nudge ourselves into a calmer state of being. We’ve used similar prompts in the past, so we can assure you that they will bring a healthy dose of awareness and help filter out some of the excess noise and chaos. Challenge yourself to follow along with us starting today as we read and write on each prompt for at least five minutes every day for the next three weeks (21 days). Let’s see how doing so gradually changes how we think, feel and behave at this unprecedented time… The goal is not to get rid of all your negative thoughts, feelings, and present life circumstances. Doing so is impossible. The goal is to change your response to them. What’s something specific about your present circumstances that’s been stressing you out? What can you do to improve your response today? The most powerful moments in life often come when you find the courage to let go of what can’t be changed. Because when you are no longer able to change a situation, you are challenged to change yourself—to grow beyond the unchangeable. And that changes everything. What’s one unchangeable reality you’ve been resisting? What can you do right now to ease your mind into the acceptance of this reality? Love what you do, until you can do what you love. Love where you are, until you can be where you love. Love the people you are with, until you can be with the rest of the people you love. This is the way we find happiness, opportunity, and peace. What do you love about your present life situation (despite the challenges that exist)? Who do you love today (despite the quirks they have)? Peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no chaos, trouble, or hard realities to deal with. Peace means to be in the midst of all those things and still remain mentally, emotionally, and physically centered. What’s something small that always brings you peace when you think about it? Why? Too often we say “life is not fair” while we’re eating our food, sipping a drink, and reading the news on our smartphones. Think twice and be thankful. Right now, before you think of anything else, breathe deeply, appreciate where you are, and see the value in what you have. What’s one privilege you have right now that you are taking for granted? Happiness is letting go of what you assume your life is supposed to be like right now and sincerely appreciating it for everything that it is. At the end of this day, before you close your eyes, smile and be at peace with where you’ve been and grateful for what you have. Life isn’t easy right now, but there is some good. What do you appreciate most about your present life situation? Why? Everything gets a bit uncomfortable when it’s time to grow. That’s just a part of the growth process. Things will get better. Be patient and remind yourself: Life never gets easier, you just get stronger. How has the discomfort you’ve felt in the past helped you grow? How can you better accept the discomfort you presently feel? Forgive yourself for the bad decisions you made, for the times you lacked understanding, for the choices that hurt others and yourself. Forgive yourself, for being young and reckless. These are all vital lessons. And what matters most right now is your willingness to grow from them. What specifically do you need to forgive yourself for? What have your error(s) in judgment taught you? Inner peace begins the moment you take a deep breath and choose not to allow an external event to control your inner peace. You are not what happened to you. You are what you choose to become in this moment. Let go, breathe, and begin again. What ideals are you holding on to that are holding you down? What can you let go of right now (without losing a thing)? We waste our time waiting for ideal paths to appear. But they never do. Because we forget that paths are made by walking, not waiting. What’s one small step you’ve been thinking about taking, for far too long? It’s funny how we outgrow what we once thought we couldn’t live without, and then we fall in love with what we didn’t even know we wanted. Life keeps leading us on journeys we would never go on if it were up to us. Don’t be afraid. Have faith. Find the lessons. Trust the journey. What’s something you’ve moved on from that once meant the world to you? And, what’s something you love today that you never even knew you needed in your life? Even when it seems personal, rarely do people do things because of you, they do things because of them. And while you may not be able control all the things people say and do to you, you can decide not to be reduced by them today. What’s something you often take too personally even though, logically, you know better? Don’t lower your standards, but do remember that removing your expectations of others is the best way to avoid being disappointed by them. You will end up sadly disappointed if you expect people will always do for you as you do for them. Not everyone has the same heart as you. How have your expectations of others gotten the best of you recently? How will you remind yourself to ease your expectations today? Everybody you know is afraid of something, loves something, and has lost something. Know this. Respect this. And be extra kind in these hard times. Take some extra time to really listen. Take some extra time to learn something new. Take some extra time time to say thank you, today. What can you easily do to be a little kinder than usual today? And, who was the last person who was unexpectedly kind to you? You won’t always be a priority to others, and that’s why you need to be a priority to yourself right now. Practice respecting yourself, taking care of yourself, and becoming your own support system in these unprecedented times. Your needs matter. Start meeting them. Don’t wait on others to choose you. Choose yourself! How will you choose yourself today? In the grand scheme of things, a relatively small part of your life is decided by uncontrollable circumstances (like COVID-19), while the vast majority of it is decided by your perspective regarding these circumstances. Let this sink in.  Regardless of what’s going on around you, peace of mind arrives the moment you come to peace with what’s on your mind. What is one specific part of your present reality you need to come to peace with? Why? Stop resisting. Breathe. Be where you are. You’re where you’re supposed to be at this moment. There’s a time and place for everything, and every step is necessary. Just keep doing your best, and don’t force what’s not yet supposed to fit into your life. When it’s meant to be, it will be. What is necessary and beneficial about where you are right now? How does it feel to embrace this present reality? Just breathe, be, and pay attention to what it’s like to be YOU in this moment. Nothing to fix. Nothing to change. Nowhere to go. Just you, breathing, being, with presence, and without judgment. You are welcome here. You belong here. Here, you are enough. What’s something specific about yourself that you need to embrace more openly and lovingly? Give yourself the space to hear your own voice—your own soul. Too many of us listen to the noise of the world and get lost in it. Stand strong! Live by choice, not by chance. Choose to listen to your own inner wisdom today. What has your inner wisdom been trying to tell you lately? Don’t fall back into your old patterns of living just because they’re more comfortable and easier to access right now. Remember, you’ve left certain habits and situations behind for a reason: to improve your life. And right now, you can’t move forward if you keep going back. What’s one old pattern of behavior that still tries to sneak up on you? What’s a better alternative today, and why? There will come a time when you think it’s all over, everything is broken… you’ve reached the end of your figurative road. That’s the starting line. Be humble. Be teachable. The world is always bigger than your view of the world. And there’s always room for a new possibility, a new step, and a new beginning. What does “a new beginning” mean to you right now? It is the compound effect of simple, seemingly ordinary actions over time that leads to life-altering, positive results. Consider this quick quote from our New York Times bestselling book: “There is nothing immediately sensational about putting one foot in front of the other every day for weeks, but by doing so, many normal human beings have climbed over 29,000 feet to the top of the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest.” And, there is nothing immediately exciting about forcing yourself into self-reflection through journaling for a short time every day, but by doing so, Angel and I (and hundreds of course students and conference attendees Angel and I have personally worked with) have drastically better lives. Remember, the mind needs to be trained to gain strength. It needs to be worked consistently to grow and develop over time. And that’s precisely what a daily ritual of journaling will gradually allow us to achieve over the next few weeks. (Note: Angel and I build more small, life-changing daily rituals like this with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy Course.) So, let’s start today, together! Angel and I are literally starting our 3-week journals the moment I hit publish on this post. Will you join us? Please leave us a comment below and let us know if you will.

Starting right now, you can decide how you spend your time, whom you socialize with, whom you share your life, money and energy with.  You can pick your words and the tone of voice in which you speak to others.  You can select what you will eat, read and study.  You can choose how you’re going to respond to unfortunate situations when they arise, and whether you will see them as curses or opportunities for growth… And most importantly, you can choose your thoughts, which dictate pretty much everything else. In other words, you are what you think.  You can’t change anything if you can’t change your thinking. Here are twenty thoughts it’s time to change: Note: Our NEW edition of 1,000 Little Things is available now. Train your mind to see the opportunity in everything.  Positivity and mindfulness are choices.  The happiness of your life depends on the quality of your thoughts. Pick one of the thoughts above, and start reworking it in your mind, a little bit every day. And I would love to hear from YOU too… Please leave me a comment below and let which one you decided to start with, and why. 🙂 (Finally, if you haven’t done so already, be sure to sign-up for our free newsletter to receive new articles like this in your inbox each week.) 3 Easy Things We Say to Avoid the Hard Things We Need to Do|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/3-easy-things-we-say.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| You are the person you believe yourself to be. “This afternoon I received a formal acceptance letter from Yale University, including a full basketball scholarship.  Despite everything my alcoholic father put me through over the years—the hungry, sleepless nights I spent in tears due to their relentless negativity—it didn’t ruin me.  With your coaching and guidance, I’ve worked hard to get out of this mess once and for all, and it’s finally paying off.” That’s the opening paragraph of an email we received last night from Monica, a longtime reader and junior coaching client of ours (she gave me permission to share this with you today).  Her email then goes on to say that she has forgiven her mom and stepfather, but also knows being on her own and taking this next step is a priceless gift.  “Honestly, for far too long the people in my life had me convinced that I wasn’t good enough,” she says.  “And although I hold no grudges, I’m so happy to be able to prove to myself that they were wrong about me.” Monica’s email made me reflect and smile, for obvious reasons. And although Monica’s circumstances are unique to her, I bet you can relate on some level.  I know I can.  Sometimes the pressure and dysfunction coming from family, peers, work, and society in general is enough to make us feel completely broken inside.  If we do things differently, we’re looked down upon.  If we dream big, we’re ridiculed.  Or if we don’t have the right job, relationship, lifestyle, and so forth, by a certain age or time frame, we start to seriously believe we’re not good enough. Monica’s story truly is a perfect reminder for all of us too, even though she’s only 18, because the self-limiting beliefs that get instilled in our minds often arrive at an early age. Maybe we got cut from a sports team as a child and thus determined “I’m not athletic enough to be fit and good at sports.”  Or we tried to play a musical instrument and were told to practice outside because we weren’t very good. For whatever reason, we encounter little struggles or rejections that drastically alter our mindset for years to come.  It happens something like this: Sound familiar? It’s time to break yourself out of this cycle, so you can start making progress again. And the first—and perhaps hardest—step is to stop saying these things to yourself: Don’t let rude people ruin you.  Don’t let them keep you down!  No matter how much negativity is thrown at you by others, there is absolutely no need for you to stay put and partake in the decay they choose for their own lives.  YOU decide how your soul grows. Because the truth is, what people say and do to you is much more about them, than you.  People’s reactions to you are about their perspectives, wounds and experiences.  Whether people think you’re amazing, or believe you’re the worst, again, is more about them.  I’m not suggesting we should be narcissists and ignore all feedback.  I am saying that so much hurt, disappointment and sadness in our lives comes from our taking things personally.  In most cases it’s far more productive and healthy to let go of other people’s good or bad opinion of you, and to operate with your own intuition and wisdom as your guide. So stay out of other people’s drama and don’t needlessly create your own.  Instead, imagine what would happen if you spent this entire day, and every day hereafter, with all your energy directed toward your most positive possibilities.  Rather than being annoyed, be amused.  Instead of getting angry, get away.  Life is too short to argue and fight.  Count your blessings and move on from the drama with your head held high.  (Note: Angel and I discuss this in detail in the “Mindfulness” chapter of our New York Times bestselling book, Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs.) Most of us are not raised to actively seek our calling.  We may not even know that we have one.  As kids, we are seldom told we have a place in life that is uniquely ours alone.  Instead, we are encouraged to believe that our life should somehow fulfill the expectations of others—that we should find our happiness exactly as they have found theirs. Rather than being taught to ask ourselves who we are, we are trained to ask others for permission.  We are, in effect, schooled to live other people’s versions of our lives.  Every day is designed and developed as told to us by someone else.  And then one day when we break free to survey our dreams, seeking to fulfill ourselves, we see that most of our dreams have gone unfulfilled because we believed, and those around us believed, that what we wanted for ourselves was somehow beyond our reach. It’s time to unlearn these lies and make changes.  It takes courage to grow wiser and become who you really are.  And today is the first day of the rest of your life. Just because someone else can, doesn’t mean you can, right?  Because you’re not good enough, or you’ve missed your chance, etc.  You look for reasons they can do it but you can’t—maybe he’s an internet entrepreneur or freelance writer because he has no kids.  Maybe she’s way fitter than I am, so she can run a marathon.  Maybe she doesn’t have all the work and family obligations I have, or has a supportive spouse, or doesn’t have bad knees. OK, fine, it’s easy to find excuses: but look at all the other people who also have considerable obstacles and have done it anyway.  Angel and I have a family, and have dealt with significant loss in our lives, and still managed to succeed on many fronts.  And just as we’ve turned things around for ourselves, we know hundreds of other people who’ve done the same.  Through a decade of life coaching, we’ve witnessed people reinventing themselves at all ages—48-year olds starting families, 57-year-olds graduating from college for the first time, 71-year-olds starting successful businesses, and so forth.  And stories abound of people with disabilities or illnesses who overcame their obstacles to achieve great things. Your obstacles can be overcome! Feeling stuck is a FEELING, not a fact.  So never assume that you’re stuck with the way things are.  Life changes, and so can you.  It’s never too late to live a life that makes you proud.  If you don’t learn anything else from this post, learn that.   There’s no age limit on changing your course.   (Note: Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Goals & Success” chapter of our brand NEW edition of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Whatever it is you want to improve in your life, start struggling with it for 30 minutes EVERY SINGLE DAY, and keep an eye out for EVERY tiny victory along your journey, no matter how hard you have to scrape, fight, and claw for it.  Then, consistently remind yourself of these victories—keep them at the forefront of your mind, and use them as motivation to take the next step, and the next. And when you catch yourself thinking something like, “I’m not good enough,” remind yourself that depending on what people around you expected of you as a child, or what you have expected of yourself all your life, you have been subtly molded into who YOU are.  And a great deal of this molding has been driven directly by external and internal negativity about what is and isn’t possible for you. But the truth is, what’s possible for you is up to you right NOW! If you’re still not convinced, I want you to think about ONE self-limiting belief you have.  It can be about any part of your life you hope to change—your health, your weight, your career, your relationships—anything at all.  What’s one thing you’ve essentially decided is a fact about your place on Earth? And then I want you to immediately shift gears and think about ONE time, one fleeting moment, in which the opposite of that ‘fact’ was true for you.  I don’t care how tiny of a victory it was, or even if it was a partial victory.  What’s one moment in time you can look back on and say, “Hey, that was totally unlike ‘me’ – but I did it!”? Once you identify the cracks in the wall of a self-limiting belief, you can start attacking it.  You can start taking the hard but necessary little steps forward every day that go against it—tiny victories, more confidence, gradual momentum, bigger victories, even more confidence, and so on. Until your inner dialog and reality change for good. I would love to hear from YOU in the comments section: What’s one self-limiting belief that has held you back? Or better yet, what do you need to stop saying to yourself? Please leave me a comment below.

How to Stop Feeling Overwhelmed (by Everything on Your Plate)|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/stop-feeling-overwhelmed.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| True purpose has no time limit.  True purpose has no deadline.  Don’t stress and overwhelm yourself.  Just do what you can right now. We all have days, weeks, months and—for some—even years of feeling anxious and overwhelmed with the work we have yet to do.  It’s an elusive feeling that aches from deep within.  From the outside, people think you have it all together, but they can’t see what’s going on in your head.  Stress fills your thoughts and emotions all too often, nagging at you throughout the day.  You have so many things to do and they never seem to get done.  You always feel a day late and a buck short.  The pressure is intense and overwhelming. Consider an email I got recently from a course student named Gale (sharing this with permission): “…the older I get the harder it is to feel peaceful and successful.  I’m a wife and a working mom of two, and the thing is, I know I’d feel happier and more effective if my family and I didn’t have so many extra curricular obligations.  But we do.  I have a weekend job where I teach and lead a youth group my daughter is enrolled in, I help my husband coach our son’s soccer team, I lead a prayer group at my church, and the list goes on and on. Right now, the only way to get everything done is to sleep less and hustle more, but I’ve noticed that I feel sick and can’t really do things well when I haven’t gotten enough sleep.  And I want to take care of my health as well, so I’ve been sleeping eight full hours for the last few nights.  And inevitably, now I’m terribly behind on everything again.” I can relate all too well, because that’s exactly how Marc and I felt before we started simplifying our lifestyle.  We were being pulled in dozens of different directions every day and never had enough time to get everything done.  Naturally, we wanted to do a great job with each obligation we had, and somehow we had convinced ourselves that we could do it all.  But the reality was we were stretched way too thin, and thus we were doing a lousy job at everything and completely stressing ourselves out in the process. So to Gale, and to everyone else who feels this way, here’s the harsh truth you’ve been avoiding: You CANNOT do it all.  Your plate is too full.  You have to let some things GO! Unless you want your health to decline and your stress to continue to skyrocket, you must start doing three key things: Our lives get incredibly complicated, not overnight, but gradually.  The complications creep up on us, one small step at a time. Today I order a few things on Amazon, tomorrow someone gives me a birthday present, then I get excited and I enroll in a free giveaway at church… and I win, so then I decide I need a new six-foot cabinet to store my growing pile of stuff.  One item at a time, the clutter builds up in my space, because I keep adding new things without purging the old. And the cycle continues in all walks of life too… Today I say yes to a Facebook party invitation, tomorrow I say yes when a neighbor asks me to help him move a couch, then I get asked to a quick lunch meeting, then I decide to volunteer at my son’s youth group.  One yes at a time, and soon my life is too busy and complicated and I don’t know where I went wrong. And because I’m feeling stressed, I distract myself… I read a couple articles on CNN.com, then I flip over to social media, then my email, and then I check my phone and watch a video of my baby niece that my sister texted… and soon another day is gone, and I didn’t get anything done, and my life gets eaten away one little bite at a time, and I feel overwhelmed with what’s left undone. How do we protect against this vicious cycle? We have to take a step back on a regular basis and reevaluate what we have on our plate and why. Instead of thinking, “Oh my gosh, there’s too much on my plate!”… let’s ask, “What if I started over again with a clean plate?” What would you do if your schedule was empty?  If your plate were completely clean, with limited space, what would you put on it today? For me, I might add some quiet, focused writing time; play time with my son; exercise time and tea time with Marc; a long lunchtime walk and a good afternoon talk with an old friend I haven’t spoken to in awhile; a couple short activities that matter to me and make a difference to others; reading and learning time; and time alone to think, meditate and unwind before bed. Those are the things that I’d put on my clean plate (and now those are the things I DO have on my plate) because they feel right to me. What would you choose to put on yours? Once you’ve figured that out, you know what belongs on your plate.  And now you just need to constantly look at invitations and activities and requests and tasks that pop up, and ask: “Is this one of the things I would choose to put on my clean plate?”  (Note: Marc and I discuss this decision-making process in detail in the “Rituals” chapter of our New York Times bestselling book, Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs.) And to help reinforce your decisions, you need to… Saying yes to everything puts you on the fast track to being miserable.  Feeling like you’re doing busywork is often the result of saying yes too often.  We all have obligations, but a comfortable pace can only be found by properly managing your yeses.  So stop saying “yes” when you want to say “no.”  You can’t always be agreeable; that’s how people take advantage of you.   Sometimes you have to set clear boundaries. You might have to say no to certain favors, or work projects, or community activities, or committees, or volunteer groups, or coaching your kid’s sports team, or some other seemingly worthwhile activity. I know what you’re thinking—it seems unfair to say no when these are very worthwhile things to do.  It kills you to say no.  But you must. Because the alternative is that you’re going to do a half-hearted, poor job at each one, be stressed beyond belief, and feel like you’re stuck in an endless cycle of failure and frustration.  You won’t be getting enough sleep, your focus will get worse and worse due to exhaustion, and eventually you’ll reach a breaking point. So remember, the only thing that keeps so many of us stuck in this debilitating cycle is the fantasy in our minds that we can be everything to everyone, everywhere at once, and a hero on all fronts.  But again, that’s not reality.  The reality is we’re not Superman or Wonder Woman—we’re human, and we have limits.  We have to let go of this idea of doing everything and pleasing everyone and being everywhere at once.  You’re either going to do a few things well, or do everything poorly.  That’s the truth. And that’s a perfect lead-in to the next point… You might have more than three things on your plate, but that doesn’t mean you should try to chew on them all at once.  In fact, in a perfect world you’d find complete focus and do only one thing well for a prolonged period of time.  You’d pick one really important item from your plate, say no to all the rest, and focus on just this one thing.  This might be a project at work, a family obligation, or a charitable cause… but just one thing.  You’d learn to do it well, you’d improve more and more every day, you’d serve people exceptionally with your masterful skill, and you wouldn’t be stressed out with juggling obligations. However, that’s not the way life works.  In most cases we can’t pare things down to one thing, so that’s why you pick two or three.  After coaching hundreds of people over the past decade, Marc and I have found that the average person can do two or three things well every day, (and one thing really well).  With two or three focuses, you won’t be as concentrated, won’t learn as deeply, but it’s doable.  With four or five focuses, you won’t do anything well or learn anything deeply or serve anyone exceptionally.  And you will be stressed out. So start paring down to two or three things: Wake up every morning and figure out what the most important two or three things are for the day, and cut out the rest.  Be ruthless.  Address your other obligations right then and there, and tell the associated people that you really want to help, but your plate is full.  You can’t serve them well today, so regretfully you must say “no.” And when you’re down to two or three things, it’s best to give each some allotted time.  So a few hours for one, and then a few hours for another, etc.  Instead of being in a stressful task-switching state of mind, just take your next task, let everything else go, and just be in the moment with this one task for the allotted time. Do this, and you will notice a difference. Because life is not complicated.  We are complicated.  When we stop trying to doing everything at once, life becomes simple again, and we become successful again, one sane moment at a time.  (Note: Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Simplicity” chapter of our brand NEW edition of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Marc and I would love to hear from YOU in the comments section. How full is your plate right now?  What do you need to take off of it? Anything else to share? Please leave me a comment below.

"3 Hard Perspective Shifts that Will Gradually Make Your Life 3 Times Easier|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/3-hard-perspective-shifts.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| 10 Truths to Keep You Going When Everything Goes Wrong|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-truths-goes-wrong.jpg?resize=500%2C334&ssl=1| The 10-Second Pause that Can Save a Day and Spare Some Pain|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-second-pause.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| Maybe it’s the life lessons I was forced to learn the hard way, or the toll of loss and failure I had recently endured, but a decade ago, in the midst of a panic attack on my 27th birthday, I had to admit to myself right then and there that the cheerful world of possibility I once felt in my youth now seemed dead inside me.  I wanted to feel light and free and ambitious and passionate again, but I didn’t know how.  Luckily, I had a wise mom nearby who gave me some good advice.  She told me that she could still see a positive, passionate young man inside of me, but that I needed to do some soul searching to reconnect myself to him. As I attempted to follow my mother’s advice, I remembered that I used to have several daily reminders written on post-it notes hanging on my bedroom wall when I was a teenager.  I called them my “10-second reminders.”  I would pause for 10 seconds and recite one to myself whenever I felt a wave of anxiety coming over me. So, I wrote down a few of those same 10-second reminders again, just as I remembered them, and I added several new ones as well.  Then I posted them up on the wall in my home office in clear sight.  I’ve literally been surrounded by these daily reminders for a decade now.  And yes, I still pause for 10 seconds at least a couple times a day, as needed, to recite them to myself.  This life-changing daily ritual helps keep me centered even on the hardest days. For anyone else who’s been feeling emotionally drained and without a real sense of how to take the next step forward, I challenge you to follow my lead.  It’s all about keeping the right reminders in an easily accessible location, so they’re readily available during those inevitable moments when you need them most. To get started, steal some of my 10-second reminders below (most of which are now excerpts from our NEW BOOK), and post them up somewhere you can see them.  Then, whenever you catch yourself in one of those draining, anxiety-filled moments, pause for 10 seconds and quietly read one to yourself.  See how doing so gradually changes the way you feel, think and live… 1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  8.  9.  10.  11.  12.  Note that none of these 10-second reminders immediately force you to do anything different.  They simply represent a shift in perspective.  And perspective is where peace and happiness begins.  From there, you can change your posture from one of anxiety and resistance to one of acceptance and opportunity. The goal isn’t to get rid of all your negative thoughts, feelings or life situations.  That’s impossible.  The goal is to change your response to them. And this means gradually embracing life’s full range of experiences—even the draining, anxiety-filled ones. Because, too often we yearn for a very small and selective range of life experiences—the fun times, the happy days, the things that make us feel comfortable.  And yet, the full range of our reality is often quite different.  Life gives us an extensive array of experiences that evoke feelings ranging from sadness to regret to pride to anger to love to loneliness… to happiness to excitement and more.  These feelings are all part of being a living, breathing human being. So we can revolt against the unfairness of life—the unfairness of having to deal with loss, having to go through adversity, having to feel lonely and uncomfortable and upset.  Or we can embrace every experience life gives us, including all our highs and lows—all the blissful moments and painful ones and everything in between.  Life is not just happy and comfortable 24/7.  It’s well-rounded, it’s full-featured, and it’s real. Embracing the full range of life’s experiences today means embracing every moment with our full presence, being open and vulnerable to reality, being gentle with ourselves when times are tough, and practicing sincere gratitude no matter what happens. It means accepting life as it is, and accepting ourselves as we are. It means not expecting the best to happen every time, but instead accepting whatever happens every time, and making the very best of it. This isn’t easy, of course, but it’s worth working on. YOU are worth working on, 10 seconds at a time. I sincerely hope you leverage the reminders above (excerpts from our new book) to do just that.  And if you’d like more reminders and life-changing daily rituals to work with, check out our new book, Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs. Also, if you haven’t done so already, watch what happened when Angel and I stepped into Megyn Kelly’s TODAY Show studio a few days ago to discuss the painful personal journey that inspired us to write Getting Back to Happy:  If you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU.

One Book I Wish I Had Read 10 Years Ago (and Why Alyssa Milano Happily Wrote the Foreword)|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/one-book-ten-years-ago.jpg?resize=500%2C334&ssl=1| The biggest and most complex obstacle you will ever have to overcome is your own mind.  Overcome that, and you can overcome anything! Of course, that’s way easier to say than to do, especially when life as you know it starts falling apart… Just over a decade ago, Marc and I had to deal with several painful life changes.  These included: It all happened so quickly, too!  The pain of those experiences compounded on one another in quick succession, knocking us down and driving the wind right out of our sails for a couple years straight.  At times, we felt like we had absolutely no strength left to push onward. But, as we navigated our new reality one step at a time—facing the pain instead of distracting ourselves from it—we stumbled across morsels of strength and wisdom that we began to collect and build on.  We gradually learned how to catch ourselves in negative states of emotional turmoil, so we could overcome the emotions that had once overcome us.  All details aside, we pushed ourselves as hard as we could to take one tiny step every day—one journal entry, one 10-minute workout, one honest conversation, and so forth.  It wasn’t easy, but the tiny steps were manageable and we gradually grew stronger. And with each passing day, we saw more beauty hidden in life’s most painful changes. You see, the most painful changes in life—even deaths—are simply endings, which are all a necessary part of living.  And all endings are necessary for beauty, too—otherwise it’s impossible to appreciate someone or something, because they are unlimited.  Limits illuminate beauty—they are reminders that we need to be aware of this beautiful person or situation, and appreciate this beautiful thing called life.  Every ending is also a beginning, because while we have lost someone or something special, this ending, like every loss, is a moment of reinvention.  Although heartbreaking, it forces us to reinvent our lives, and in this reinvention is an opportunity to experience beauty in new, unseen ways and places.  And, of course, every ending is an opportunity to celebrate the beautiful, ever-changing journey we’re on, and to be grateful for what it has showed us and taught us along the way. Getting to this point of understanding—changing your perspective—again, is far from easy.  But it’s honestly worth every bit of effort you can muster, no matter how many times you need to remind yourself. Because we so easily forget how important it is to face the unexpected losses and painful life changes we’re going to encounter no matter how much we try to avoid them—to face down our pain and negative thinking and leverage it to get back up and take the next step.  Yes, we need to be reminded to actually get up and DO the hard things we need to do to be happy again.  The things that frighten us.  The things others can’t do for us.  The things that make the difference between existing and living—between knowing the path and walking the path—between a life of empty promises and defeat and one filled with renewed happiness, possibility and peace. And that’s why Marc and I wrote our brand new book, Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs, to be that daily reminder for anyone who’s struggling to change their situation for the better.  It’s a dynamic and actionable guide for taking life day by day and focusing on the little things that make a lasting difference.  This book represents the culmination of hundreds of hours of work with course students, live event attendees, and lots of one-on-one work with each other, too…  “With the help of Marc and Angel’s hard-won insights, we can always find a way to pick ourselves up, reframe our mindset to see the bigger picture, and take that first step back to happy.” —Alyssa Milano Yes, that’s a quick snippet of what Alyssa Milano had to say in the foreword to Getting Back to Happy. But, why did a famous, renowned actress and activist like her decide to write this foreword for a couple of coaches and authors like us? Perhaps another slightly longer snippet from her foreword will clarify things: “In my own journey to uncover who I truly am, and to find—and use—my voice for what I believe in, I’ve been lucky enough to meet many kindred spirits along the way, many of them online.  Marc and Angel are among the fellow travelers I’ve come to value the most.  Their honesty and clarity, and the generous way they share what they’ve learned for themselves, are gifts I’ve truly cherished.  Sharing their ideas with others online is a way of paying forward what I’ve learned, in the hope that others will gain some insight and strength, and in turn spread the word even further.  The pain of self-doubt and the isolation of modern life can make us feel like we’re the only ones struggling, while everyone else is picture-perfect.  That’s why it’s so important to share not just our triumphs but also our setbacks, to “show our work” when we’re in the thick of tough times.  Marc and Angel do just that—keeping it real, and creating a community of kindred spirits that gathers together in strength, growing and learning along the way.” —Alyssa Milano In life our insights are often hard won, as Alyssa points out.  And, ten years ago, when Marc and I were desperately struggling after losing two loved ones back-to-back to suicide and illness, we decided to be transparent about our story, our struggles, and our depression.  And we also decided to share the tiny daily steps we were taking to cope, to heal, to grow, and ultimately to get our lives back on track.  We shared all of this online via Facebook, Twitter, email, and our blog, and Alyssa was one of the people who resonated with our story and followed our journey right from the get-go… because she found personal value in what we were sharing. And then, she continued to follow our work over the years that followed, primarily because we didn’t stop sharing what we were learning. As Marc and I have learned—and as you’ve probably encountered too—there’s little doubt that our most important insights come directly from our hardest challenges.  But we can also take these insights and pay them forward, sharing them with others in hopes that our insights might shine a light for other people who are struggling down their own paths. The opportunity to pay forward what we’ve learned inspires us continuously in our work, whether it’s through our blog, our renowned Getting Back to Happy course and coaching, our annual Think Better Live Better conference, our books, and everything else we do.  And, it’s also one of the biggest reasons we wrote our newest book, also titled Getting Back to Happy, as you know.  Everything we’ve learned in the past decade of coaching and teaching others about how to build a happier life is distilled into this book. Never before have we put it all in one place like this in such an accessible way. In fact, here’s a sneak peek of the table of contents, so you can get an idea of what Getting Back to Happy has to offer: When we reached out to Alyssa and shared the idea and outline of the book with her, she immediately said “yes” to writing the foreword.  Specifically, she said she was “honored to be given the chance to continue paying it forward.” Getting Back to Happy is honestly the book we’ve wanted to write ever since we started on this journey, one that began with our personal struggle and evolved into a multifaceted coaching practice that has positively impacted the lives of thousands of amazing people, just like Alyssa. I sincerely wish I could have read it a decade ago.  In many ways, it would have saved me from myself.  It absolutely would have saved me from intense periods of darkness that were born primarily from my subconscious attempt to take the easy way out of the painful realities I faced. So yes, this is a big deal, and we’re excited to share Getting Back to Happy with YOU (which will be officially released this Tuesday).  In fact, we’re so excited that we’re also giving away over $50 in bonuses to the first 2,000 blog readers that pre-order the book (including One Day at a Time, our 60-day workbook for implementing rewarding, lifelong rituals, and Daily Reminders We Need to Read Every Morning, with prompts that guide you to start each day in a mindful state, so you can focus and get the right things done).  You’ll want to act quickly, though, because we already have 1,907 pre-orders booked as of this morning. 🙂 Order Getting Back to Happy and get your free bonuses right now (use the form here to submit your receipt).

Tune in if you’re able…  5 Hard Things You Need to Start Doing for Yourself on Hard Days|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/5-hard-things-hard-days.jpg?resize=500%2C301&ssl=1| On particularly hard days when I feel that I can’t endure, I remind myself that my track record for getting through hard days is 100% so far. And, I remind myself that hard days are necessary, to live through and to learn from.  The hardest days make us who we are, inside and out.  This can be difficult to grasp at first… So many of us are afraid of ourselves, of our own truth, and our feelings most of all.  We talk about how great the concepts of life and love and passion are, but then we subconsciously hide from them every day.  We hide from our truest feelings.  Because the truth is, life and love and passion all hurt sometimes, and the feelings this pain brings disturbs us. We are taught at an early age that pain is evil and harmful.  Yet, how can we ever deal with real life and true love and passionate work if we’re afraid to feel what we really feel?  We need to feel pain, just as we need to feel alive and loved and driven.  Pain is meant to wake us up, yet we try to hide from it.  Realize this!  Pain is something to carry willingly, just like good sense.  Because you can only learn how strong you are in every important area of your life when being strong is the only choice you have. It’s all in how you carry the things that don’t come easy or don’t go your way.  That’s what matters in the end.  You should stand up for your right to feel pain, to endure it, to deal with the hard realities of life and love and work, as you grow into the strongest, wisest, truest version of yourself. While I’m certain there’s no “one size fits all” list of advice for growing through the pain of hard days, there are some very important general principles that apply to most people who are presently in the trenches.  The points below, then, aren’t universal clarifications, but simple guidelines that will hopefully give you a general starting point for supporting yourself when you need it most. “I’m exhausted and so very tired of all the anxiety, negativity and stress.  Too often my mind is consumed with draining thoughts, and every muscle in my body seems tense.  It hurts.  I don’t want to feel this way anymore.  I don’t want to feel like I live in a whirlwind of constant pressure and exhaustion.  I don’t want to just ‘get by’ day to day…” Those are the opening lines of a story an attendee at our Think Better, Live Better conference shared with me (her commentary was recorded live and I’m sharing this with her full permission).  She went on to tell me that expecting negative things to happen has been her way of approaching life.  If you can relate in any way at all, it’s time to revamp your mindset. Our minds are incredibly powerful.  They can bring us down or lift us up at a moment’s notice.  How we think about things literally changes everything! Whenever I’m coaching someone who’s struggling in the trenches, I gracefully shift their focus from what they don’t want to what they DO want.  I remind them that what you focus on grows stronger in your life, and that the best time to focus on the positive and take responsibility for your happiness is when you don’t feel like it.  Because that’s when doing so can make the biggest difference. You may not be responsible for everything that happened to you in the past, or everything that’s happening to you right now, but you need to be responsible for undoing the thinking patterns these circumstances create. It’s about thinking better so you can ultimately live better. The key is to understand that no matter what happens, you can choose your response, which dictates pretty much everything that happens next.  Truly, the greatest weapon you have against anxiety, negativity and stress is your ability to choose one present thought over another—to train your mind to make the best of what you’ve got in front of you, even when it’s far less than you expected. Yes, you can change the way you think!  And once you do, you can master a new way to be.  (Note: This is also a process Marc and I work through extensively with our readers in our brand NEW BOOK.) In a very real way, the stories we tell ourselves change what we see in life.  When we enter an experience with a story about how life is, that tends to be what we see, even when there’s plenty of evidence to the contrary.  I was reminded of this recently by another attendee at our Think Better, Live Better conference. She compared her present marital problems and stress to an old parable in which a group of blind men touch an elephant for the very first time to learn what it’s like.  Each one of them feels a different part of the elephant, but only that one part, such as the leg, trunk, side, or tusk.  Then the men eagerly compare notes and quickly learn that they are in complete disagreement about what an elephant looks like—and lots of tension and drama ensued. Something similar happens through our wide-ranging, different past experiences.  Some of us have been deeply heartbroken.  Some of us have lost our parents, siblings or children to accidents and illnesses.  Some of us have dealt with infidelity.  Some of us have been fired from jobs we relied on.  Some of us have been discriminated against because of our gender or race.  And, when we enter a new experience that arouses prominent memories of our own painful story from the past, it shifts our perspective in the present—it narrows it. When a negative past experience narrows our present perspective, it’s mostly just a defense mechanism.  Every day of our lives we are presented with some level of uncertainty, and our innate human defense mechanisms don’t like this one bit.  So our minds try to compensate by filling in the gaps of information by clinging to the stories we already feel comfortable with.  We end up subconsciously trying to make better sense of everything in the present by using old stories and past experiences as filler.  And while this approach works sometimes, other times our old stories and past experiences are completely irrelevant to the present moment, so they end up hurting us and those we love far more than they help. Thus, my challenge for you today is this: Whenever you feel tension and drama building up inside you, ask yourself… Do your best to consciously detach yourself from the story you’re telling yourself.  Go deeper into reality.  Don’t just look at the surface.  Investigate.  Observe without presupposing. Again, it’s about thinking better right now so you can ultimately live better right now. Replacing your negativity with positivity isn’t about turning off all your negative thoughts and stories; that’s nearly impossible because negative thinking typically arises spontaneously and uncontrollably.  It’s also not about turning your false negative thoughts and stories into false positive ones.  The goal is to reframe your negative thoughts and stories effectively, so they are based entirely in reality, detached from needless drama, and focused on the next positive step forward that can be taken in the present moment. One smart place to start is evaluating and eliminating the negative meanings you assign to situations that don’t meet your expectations.  For example… Fabricating negative meanings and conclusions like these, based on your own stubborn expectations, is a great way to keep your mind stuck in the gutter.  This isn’t to say that you should never expect anything at all from yourself and others (diligence, honesty, ambition, etc.), but rather that the thought patterns governing your expectations should not automatically steer you toward unreasonable negativity. Remember, negative thinking stops us from seeing and experiencing life’s positive and neutral outcomes, even when they happen often.  It’s as if there’s a special mental block filtering out everything except the data that confirms the negative biases we have.  So, do your best to catch yourself today. Being able to distinguish between the negativity you imagine and what is actually happening in your life right now is an important step towards living a happier life. One of the most important moments in life is the moment you finally find the courage and determination to let go of what can’t be changed.  Because, when you are no longer able to change a situation, you are challenged to change yourself… to grow beyond the unchangeable.  And that changes everything. Of course, when hard times hit there’s a default human tendency to hold on—to extrapolate and assume the future holds more of the same.  This doesn’t happen as often when things are going well.  A laugh, a smile, and a warm fuzzy feeling are fleeting and we know it.  We take the good times at face value in the moment for all they’re worth and then we let them go.  But when we’re depressed, struggling, or fearful, it’s easy to heap on more pain by assuming tomorrow will be exactly like today.  This is a cyclical, self-fulfilling prophecy.  Know this!  If you don’t allow yourself to move past what happened, what was said, what was felt, you will look at your present and future through that same dirty lens, and nothing will be able to focus your foggy judgment.  You will keep on justifying, reliving, and fueling a perception that is worn out and false. But be sure, this is more than simply accepting that life will improve as time passes.  Yes, “time heals wounds,” but yours is not a passive role in the process of healing and moving past pain.  The question is: where are your present steps taking you? It doesn’t matter what’s been done; what truly matters is what YOU DO from here. Realize that most people make themselves miserable simply by finding it impossible to accept life just as it is presenting itself right now. Don’t be one of them! Let go of your fantasies.  This letting go doesn’t mean you don’t care about something or someone anymore.  It’s just realizing that the only thing you really have control over is yourself, in this moment. About a decade ago, when I was intensely focused on weight lifting and physical strength training, I gradually learned that you can’t be truly committed to any goal if you have a weak mind that’s unwilling to be uncomfortable.  To combat this, I wrote two simple questions on two different post-it notes and stuck one on my bathroom mirror and the other inside my gym locker: To this day, the answer to both questions is surely hundreds for most people, including myself.  Weakness of the mind is a real dream killer, especially when the going gets tough, and the only way to fix this weakness is daily practice. Far too often we think that inner strength is all about how we respond to extremely hard circumstances.  How did she perform on stage during that nationally televised event?  Did he bounce back from that heart-wrenching divorce?  Can she keep her life together even after suffering from a major, debilitating bodily injury? There’s no doubt that extremely hard circumstances test our bravery, determination and inner strength, but what about common, daily circumstances? Just like every muscle in the body, the mind needs to be exercised to gain strength.  It needs to be worked consistently to grow and develop over time.  If you haven’t pushed yourself in hundreds of little ways over time, of course you’ll crumble on that one day that things get really challenging. But it doesn’t have to be that way… Choose to go to the gym when it would be easier to sleep in.  Choose to do the tenth rep when it would be easier to quit at nine.  Choose to create something special when it would be easier to consume something mediocre.  Choose to raise your hand and ask that extra question when it would be easier to stay silent.  Prove to yourself, in dozens of little ways, that you have the guts to get in the ring and wrestle with life on a daily basis. Inner strength is built through lots of small, daily victories.  It’s the individual choices we make day-to-day that build our “inner strength muscles.”  We all want this kind of strength, but we can’t simply think our way to it.  If you want it, you have to do something about it ritualistically.  It’s your positive daily rituals that prove your mental fortitude and move you in the direction of your dreams over the long-term. The bottom line is that when things get difficult for most people, they find something more comfortable to do.  When things get difficult for mentally and emotionally strong people, they find a way to stay on track with their positive daily rituals.  (Note: Marc and I build positive, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy course.)

"2 Hard Things You Need to Do to Be at Peace Today|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/2-hard-things-peace.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| The goal is to change your response to what you can’t control. To grow so strong on the inside that nothing on the outside can affect your inner wellness without your conscious permission. “Tough times don’t last—tough people do.” Repeat that to yourself as often as you need to in the days and weeks ahead, as the world gradually comes to grips with the hard reality of COVID-19. There’s a saying in Tibetan philosophy, “Tragedy should be used as a source of strength.” My grandmother always repeated this line to me when I was growing up. Every time I dealt with some kind of unexpected struggle, she would graciously remind me that it was helping me grow, so long as I was willing to open my mind to it. Over the years I have learned just how right she was, and how relevant her wisdom is for all of us right now. Remind yourself that the mind is our biggest battleground. It’s the place where the strongest conflict resides. And with COVID-19 occupying so much of our present attention, we need now more than ever to keep ourselves in check. In the game of life, we all receive a unique set of unexpected limitations and variables in the field of play. The question is: How will you respond to the hand you’ve been dealt? You can either focus on the lack thereof or empower yourself to play the game sensibly and resourcefully, making the very best of every outcome as it arises, even when it’s heartbreaking and hard to accept. Obviously, with the COVID-19 virus spreading rapidly around the world right now, we are all facing a tough reality. We are occupying an uncertain moment in time, on the cusp of a seemingly historic event. And while human lives are the primary concern, it’s also wise to consider the impact it may have on your mental health—to mentally and emotionally prepare yourself. Thinking better is all about learning to respond effectively. When you can’t control what’s happening in the world around you, you must challenge yourself to control the way you respond to what’s happening. Because that’s where your power is! Of course, that’s much easier said than done, for all of us. So, let’s practice together. We can do hard things! We can make better choices… We can choose how we spend our time in the days and weeks ahead. We can choose gratitude and grace. We can choose whom we socialize with—and perhaps more importantly, whom we don’t (social distancing). We can choose to love and appreciate the people in our lives for exactly who they are. We can choose to love and appreciate ourselves, too. We can choose how we’re going to respond to life’s surprises and struggles (COVID-19 being one of them), and whether we will see them as curses or opportunities for personal growth. And, perhaps most importantly, we can choose to think better about our present circumstances, and let go of what we can’t control, so we can consciously make the best of what’s ahead of us. When we think better, we live better, and peace becomes us. Let’s not try to just “be positive” right now. Let’s not try to fake it. Instead, let’s simply open our minds to the unknowns in front of us. Here’s how: (Note: This is an excerpt from our New York Times bestseller, “Getting Back to Happy”.) You might be surprised by how often you subconsciously resist life. If you evaluate your body and posture right now, I bet you can find some kind of tension. For me, it’s often in my neck, but sometimes it’s in my back and shoulders. Where does this tension we feel come from? We’re resisting something – perhaps we’re annoyed by someone, frustrated at life, overwhelmed by all our obligations, or just bored. And our mental resistance creates a tension in our bodies and unhappiness in our lives. Therefore, Marc and I often recommend this simple strategy to our course students who are struggling to relieve themselves of their resistance and tension: Repeat this practice as often as needed today. Face the day with less tension and more presence. Change your mode of being from one of struggle and resistance to one of peace and acceptance. (Note: This is an excerpt from the newest edition of “1,000 Little Things”.) Imagine you had a ripe, juicy tangerine sitting on the table in front of you. You pick it up eagerly, take a bite, and begin to taste it. You already know how a ripe, juicy tangerine should taste, and so when this one is a bit tarter than expected, you make a face, feel a sense of disappointment, and swallow it, feeling cheated out of the experience you expected. Or perhaps the tangerine tastes completely normal— nothing special at all. So, you swallow it without even pausing to appreciate its flavor as you move on to the next unworthy bite, and the next. In the first scenario, the tangerine let you down because it didn’t meet your expectations. In the second, it was too plain because it met your expectations to a T. Do you see the irony here? It’s either not good or not good enough. This is how many of us live our lives . . . unhappily and unsuccessfully. It’s why so many of us feel let down, disappointed, and unexcited about almost everything. Because nothing really meets our expectations. Now, imagine you try this instead: remove your expectations of how the tangerine “should” taste. You don’t know, and you don’t expect to know, because you haven’t even tried it yet. Instead, you’re genuinely curious, impartial, and open to a variety of possible flavors. You taste it, and you truly pay attention. You notice the juiciness, the texture of the pulp, the simultaneously tangy, tart, and sweet flavors swirling around on your tongue, and all the other complex sensations that arise in your awareness as you chew. You didn’t know how this tangerine would taste, but now you realize it’s different from the rest, and it’s remarkable in its own way. It’s a totally new experience—a worthwhile experience—because you’ve never tasted this tangerine before. Mindfulness experts often refer to this as “beginner’s mind,” but really, it’s just the result of a mind-set free of needless, stifling expectations. The tangerine, of course, can be substituted for almost anything in your life: any event, any situation, any relationship, any person, any thought at all that enters your mind. If you approach any of these with expectations of “how it should be” or “how it has to be” in order to be good enough for you, they will almost always disappoint you in some way, or be too plain and unexciting to even remember. And you’ll just move on to the next disappointment or unworthy life experience, and the next, and the next, and so on and so forth, until you’ve lived the vast majority of your life stuck in an endless cycle of experiences you barely like or barely even notice. The bottom line is that every situation imaginable has hidden beauty in it if we are willing to open up to it. For example, in the past, even as Marc and I have coped with the death of loved ones, we’ve discovered opportunities for us to appreciate life more, to appreciate the lives of those we’ve lost, and to appreciate the priceless time we had with our loved ones. We do our best to embody this same mindset in every difficult life situation we encounter. When we get ill, it’s a chance for us to rest. When some unforeseeable event—like COVID-19—postpones one of our business projects, we spend more time with family. When our son, Mac, throws a temper tantrum, we see that he’s expressing himself, asserting his individuality and being human. We choose to find beauty even when it’s buried beneath struggles and pain. And you can do the same in the days and weeks ahead. Again, we can practice together. This is truly a moment opportunity for us. Please leave a comment below and let us know: Which point above resonated the most? Anything else to share about COVID-19 or your present circumstances? Marc and I would love to hear from YOU. 🙂 Also, our podcast, THINK BETTER, LIVE BETTER (yes, it shares the title of our annual live event) can be used as a tool to keep your mindset grounded while you’re socially distancing, etc. You can listen to the whole first season—30 episodes—on your favorite podcast player right now (M&A on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts). 40 Incredible Life Experiences You Will Never Forget|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/40-incredible-life-ex.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| 4 “Notes to Self” that Will Stop You from Taking Today for Granted|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/9-notes-for-granted.jpg?resize=500%2C375&ssl=1| 7 Hard Things You Should Do for Yourself When You Don’t Feel Good Enough|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-stop-treating.jpg?resize=500%2C281&ssl=1| You are enough. You have enough. You do enough. Breathe deep… let go, and just live right now in the moment. Angel and I coach a number of students, 2-on-1 and in small groups — and pretty much every one of them is hard on themselves in some way. There’s this underlying feeling of stress and pain driven by disappointed in themselves, anger at themselves, or constantly believing they are inadequate. Can you relate to this? I think most of us can. This is a fundamental problem that most of us face, every single day. We don’t love significant aspects of ourselves. We beat ourselves up. We are frightened of uncertainty because we don’t think we’re good enough to handle it. We don’t trust ourselves, because we’ve formed a negative understanding of ourselves over the years. We get angry at ourselves for eating the wrong things, consuming too much alcohol, making mistakes in a social situations, getting distracted and watching Netflix or playing games on our phone, and so it goes. We are incredibly harsh on ourselves, and don’t like how we look or who we are, and it haunts us from the inside out. Our feelings of self-doubt affects everything we do. It makes us more stressed, less happy, anxious, depressed, stuck, procrastinating, less present in relationships, less focused, more likely to reach for comfort foods or distraction or mindless shopping to comfort ourselves from the stress and pain of being who we are. But if we could give ourselves love and respect, it would start to heal all of this. Everything could shift. We could deal with uncertainty and chaos and difficulty in a much more resilient way. Giving ourselves love and respect is such an important act of self-care, and yet is rarely ever done. Set reminders for yourself, everywhere you go. Put reminders on your fridge, in your phone, on your bathroom mirror, on your desk, on your night table. The reminders need to convey a simple underlying message… YOU ARE ENOUGH. Meditate on that for a moment right now. When was the last time someone told you they loved and respected you just the way you are, and that what you think and how you feel means the world? When was the last time someone told you that you did a great job, or when necessary, that everything is going to be OK. When was the last time that ‘someone’ was YOU? Today is the day! It’s time to break the self-doubt cycle and remind yourself to treat yourself better! So, to reinforce your newfound “enoughness” practice, here are some simple — but not easy — ways to actually apply it to different aspects of your daily life: Sadly, only a tiny percentage of the people in this world will actually experience their lives today. So many of us will be stuck on another day, another time and place that troubled us and caused us to spiritually stumble, and thus we will miss out on life as we’re living it. Realize this. Do not allow your spirit to be softened or your happiness to be limited by a time and place you cannot get back to, or a day that does not yet exist. Remember, no matter what, you can always fight the battles of just today. It’s only when you add the infinite battles of yesterday and tomorrow that life gets overly complicated. Truth be told, before you know it you’ll be asking, “How did it get so late so soon?” So take time right now to figure yourself out. Take time to realize what you want and need in this moment. Take time to love, to laugh, to cry, to learn, to work, and to move your present self forward. Remember that there is a place within you that you can go to at any moment. It is calm and full of love. Forget about the noise of the world is reciting to you. Look within. Go there when you are sad. Go there when you are fearful or angry or troubled. Go there when you are alone in your car in hectic traffic, or when you are surrounded by people who intimidate you. And don’t forget to go there when you are happy too. Remind yourself that you are not your body. You are not your past or future. You are not what others expect of you. The essence of your being is love and it is within you right now. Your spirit is simply waiting for you to remember this. So, go to that quiet place in the center of you. Let the deep love and serenity swallow you whole. Everything is always okay, even when it’s not. Let go of the mind’s need to remind you of everything outside that weighs you down. You are none of that. You are at peace in this moment. Breathe. (Note: Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Ever feel totally out of your element? Like you’re due to be discovered for the “fraud” that you are? This is what psychologists call the “impostor syndrome” — where you constantly feel like everyone around you has their act together, but you don’t. And the more others recognize your achievements, the more you feel like a fake. Because as you enhance your knowledge — as you expand the scope of what you know — you’ll inevitably be exposed to more and more of what you don’t know, and thus you may begin to subconsciously discredit what you do know. It’s a bizarre cycle. Again, “Impostorism” is, for many of us, a natural symptom of gaining expertise. Move up the ranks in life, and you’ll inevitably encounter more talented people to compare yourself negatively against. The cycle never stops, and we all get caught up in it in some way. For example. I’ve personally written over 1,000 self-improvement articles on www.marcandangel.com that have received millions of page views and social media shares, and praise from a dedicated community of readers and students, but each time I write a new post I think, “Oh boy, this time they’re going to find me out,” as if I’m some low-profile underachiever who doesn’t deserve to be writing or changing lives. The solution is to talk it out with a trusted friend, partner, or coach. Talk about your insecurities more, and let them do the same. Admittedly, it’s a hard conversation to initiate, so in the mean time just remember that everyone feels like an impostor sometimes — it’s not just you. (Note: Angel and I talk it out with our Getting Back to Happy Course students, one at a time, with immense compassion, every single day. And we would be grateful to work with YOU, too.) One of the hardest lessons in life is letting go. Whether it’s feelings of guilt, anger, disappointment, loss or betrayal. Change is never easy. We fight to hold and we fight to let go. But we must eventually let GO. There’s no point in stressing over what you can’t change. Stop over-thinking it. Let it be, and allow yourself to grow from the experience. Perhaps you’re annoyed by someone, frustrated at work, overwhelmed by all your obligations, or just upset by some aspect of your life. And your tight mental grasp of the circumstance creates a tension in your body and unhappiness in your mind. Therefore, Angel and I often recommend this simple strategy to our course students who are struggling to relieve themselves of their stress and tension: Repeat this practice as often as needed. Face the day with less tension and more presence. Change your mode of being from one of struggle and grasping to one of peace and freedom. Your inner light is seen. Your heart is heard. Your spirit is treasured by more people than you imagine. If you knew how many others have been touched in profound ways by you, you would be astounded. If you knew how many people feel so much for you, you would be speechless. You are far more brilliant than you think you are. Stop discrediting yourself for everything you aren’t, and start giving yourself credit for everything that you are. Behind you is infinite power, before you is endless possibility, around you is boundless opportunity. Give yourself credit, for all of it… “If you want to control your animals, give them a larger pasture.” That’s a quote Angel and I heard at a meditation retreat recently in a group discussion focused on the power of changing your attitude about the things you can’t change or don’t need to change. I see “the animals” and their “larger pasture” as a form of letting go and allowing things to be the way they are — instead of trying to tightly control something, you’re loosening up, giving it more space, a larger pasture. The animals will be happier — they will roam around and do what they naturally do. And yet your needs will be met too — you will have more space to be at peace with the way the animals are. This same philosophy holds true for many aspects of life — stepping back and allowing certain things to happen means these things will take care of themselves, and your needs will also be met. You will have less stress (and less to do), and more time and energy to work on the things that truly matter  — the things you actually can control — like your self-care, and your attitude about everything. What can we do when someone close to us is being annoying, irritating, rude or just generally difficult? What can we do when their negativity brings us down? Well, assuming we’re not in any sort of real danger and we don’t need to physically protect ourselves, the best choice is often a simple mindset shift. Rather than trying to change the other person, we change our response to them. I know that suggestion can be frustrating for some people. Why should we have to make a change when it’s the other person who’s misbehaving? The key, though, is to understand that with a few simple mindset shifts you can find a lot more peace around just about anyone. But if you try to shift the behavior of others, you’re only going to drive yourself crazy. This is well-illustrated by a metaphor Angel and I heard yesterday from an instructor in a group meditation class: “Where could I find enough rubber to cover the rocky surface of the world? With just the rubber on the soles of my shoes. Think about it. It’s as if the whole world were covered as I walk. Likewise, I am unable to control external life situations, but I shall control my own mind. What need is there to control anyone or anything else?” That simple metaphor conveys the truth: the surface of the Earth is rocky and hard to walk on in most places. So, we can try to find a covering for the whole world — which is obviously impossible — or we can simply cover our own feet with rubber-soled shoes, and then walk around peacefully wherever we please. Similarly, we can either try to control the difficult people around us — another impossibility — or we can control our responses to them. So, when you sense negativity coming at you, give it a small push back with a thought like, “That remark (or gesture, or whatever) is not really about me, it’s about you (or the world at large).” Remember that all people have emotional issues they’re dealing with (just like you), and it makes them rude and downright thoughtless sometimes. They are doing the best they can, or they’re not even aware of their issues. In any case, you can learn not to interpret their behaviors as personal attacks, and instead see them as non-personal encounters (like the rocky ground under your feet) that you can either respond to effectively when necessary (by putting your figurative shoes on), or not respond to at all.

The highway would pass through an area with relatively low population density where an old broken-down temple stood. The government purchased the property rights to the old temple and the surrounding grounds, and agreed to let a few local monks move a 500-year-old white stucco statue of Buddha to a safer location. The stucco Buddha was absolutely immense in size and weight. It stood nearly 11 feet tall, with a 6-foot circumference, and weighed in at nearly 15,000 pounds. So the local monks worked with the government leaders to arrange for a large crane and transport to safely move the stucco Buddha from the old temple grounds to a new home on the other side of the city.  A couple weeks later, when the crane was actually in the process of moving the stucco Buddha, it was clear that everyone involved had miscalculated the statue’s weight and fragility. At one point, a turbulent wind gust forced the crane operator to bring the stucco Buddha back down to the ground with a hard thud. The massive idol cracked open in several places the moment it hit the ground, and the local monks screamed and pleaded for all crane operations to be halted for the day. Then, tarps were placed over the cracked statue to protect it from ensuing turbulent winds. That evening, one of the monks was still very disturbed and couldn’t sleep a wink. So he put on his windbreaker and returned to the stucco Buddha with a lantern. He wanted to evaluate the damage to his sacred and holy idol. As he peered under one of the tarps and through a crack in the stucco, he noticed something odd buried several inches beneath the surface of the statue. He picked up a mallet that the crane operator had left on the job site, and carefully chipped away at a small, loose piece of stucco that was wedged in the crack. When that loose piece of stucco eventually fell to ground, he peered through the now larger crack and was absolutely amazed by what he saw. So he returned to his monastery, woke up his fellow monks, and asked for their immediate assistance. He told each of them to wear a windbreaker and bring a lantern and a mallet. Together, they returned to the stucco Buddha and, working against the winds, they began to chip away at the enormous sacred statue they and their ancestors had idolized and protected diligently for 20 generations. When they completed their work the next morning, they all stood back in astonishment and gazed at what, together, they had worked tirelessly to uncover: their giant stucco Buddha statue wasn’t made of stucco at all. Instead, it was made of solid gold. And today, in the year 2020, the Golden Buddha—as it is now known—remains the largest known solid gold statue in the history of mankind. In today’s dollars, just the price of the gold alone that makes up this behemoth of a Golden Buddha is worth more than $250,000,000.  As Einstein so profoundly said, “Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.” Of course, there are dozens of life lessons we can glean from the seemingly impossible true story of the giant Golden Buddha. But, at this moment, let’s just reflect on Einstein’s sentiment… Reality is frequently inaccurate, and in the long run, the eyes see only what the mind is prepared to comprehend and discover. We as a species are forever fighting through turbulent winds and chipping away at the layers of figurative stucco in our lives—layers of new truths hidden beneath old ones. And isn’t it funny how we can wrap our minds so tightly around things and fit them into our own version of reality? Sometimes for hundreds of years straight before we are forced to see things differently? So, let that sink in right now. Life is a series of natural and evolving updates to what’s real. What we know to be true eventually changes, because time and growth both demand it. Don’t resist these changes; that only creates sorrow. Instead, choose to soar in life’s turbulent winds. Truth be told, sometimes you simply need to let go and accept the feeling of not knowing exactly why things happen the way they do, or where your journey is taking you. And you need to train yourself to appreciate this freedom. Because it is only when you are suspended in the air, with no clear destination in sight, that you force your wings—and your mind—to open fully so you can fly. And as you soar around you still may not know where you’re traveling to. But that’s not what’s important. What’s important is the opening of your wings and mind. You may not know where you’re headed, but you know that so long as your wings are spread, and your mind alert, the turbulent winds of life will guide you forward to new discoveries and realities none of us can even fathom right now.

"7 Short Stories that Will Change Your Attitude (and Spare Some Pain)|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-short-stories.jpg?resize=500%2C332&ssl=1| 12 “Notes to Self” About the Hard Things You Need to Do to Be Happy|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/12-notes-to-self-happy.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| “You need to do hard things to be happy in life.  The things most people avoid, such as those that make you uncomfortable, that are far easier to hide from, that others can’t do for you, that make you second-guess yourself and question how you’re going to find the strength to push forward. Why? Because the hard things ultimately build you up and change your life.  They make the difference between existing and living, between knowing the path and walking it, between a lifetime of empty promises and one filled with progress and fulfillment.” A reader copied those exact lines out of our New York Times bestselling book, Getting Back to Happy, and emailed them to me last night along with this message (I’m sharing this with permission): “I absolutely adore the opening lines of your book.  Although they’re merely the icebreaker to the depth of knowledge and narrative that follows them, these lines by themselves speak volumes to me.  Because the hard things I know I need to do for myself are always the easiest to avoid on a daily basis.  It’s undeniably crazy how often I catch myself sidestepping the very tasks that would make me happier and more fulfilled in the long run. So, I just want to say thank you.  I’m following your advice and writing some notes to myself today, and I’m going to paste these notes up in places I can’t avoid looking.  It’s time to start doing the hard things I need to do to be happy!  And it’s time to remind myself of this continuously until it sinks in.” Honestly, I couldn’t resonate more with this reader’s sentiment.  The hard things are always the easiest things to avoid, for all of us.  We distract ourselves.  We procrastinate.  We make excuses.  We pretend like the hard things that need to get done somehow don’t apply to us and our present life situations.  But, of course, that’s not reality.  And reality always rears its head in the end. The real truth about how ordinary people — like you and me — achieve extraordinary happiness and incredible feats of success in their lifetime is that they step out of their comfort zones on a daily basis and do the hard things that their more privileged, talented and qualified peers don’t have the focus, drive or determination to do. So, let’s make a stand right here, right now, together.  Let’s start doing the hard things TODAY!  And as we gradually notice our progress stacking up, I guarantee we will be blown away at just how remarkable we really are and just how rewarding life can be. As our reader mentioned, the key is keeping our minds focused on what needs to be done.  Practice pausing every day, as often as necessary, to reflect on this. Write yourself some “notes to self” — like the ones listed below (all of which are excerpts from our NYT bestselling book) — and then place them where you can easily see and reference them throughout the day (for example, my notes are taped on the wall directly in front of my desk, and then I have one set as the background on my iPhone).  These “notes to self” will help keep you on track by keeping your mind empowered with trains of thought that push you to do the hard things you know you need to do on a daily basis, to be happier and more fulfilled in the long run. Get started now by stealing a few of the notes below — perhaps just the ones that best relate to your present life situation (you can fine-tune them too if you like) — and place them somewhere you can see them.  Then, whenever you catch yourself slacking off on your best intentions, pause for a minute and quietly read one to yourself.  See how doing so helps keep you on track… Doing the hard things in life is a skill to be honed.  At the most fundamental level, it’s the ability to overcome distractions and get the right things done.  It involves acting according to what you know is right instead of how you feel in the moment (perhaps irritated or lazy).  And it typically requires sacrificing some level of immediate gratification and for what truly matters.  (Note: this is a skill set Angel and I also hone with our students, one-on-one, in the “Goals and Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy Course.) If you can spare a few extra minutes, watch this candid conversation Angel and I recorded for you, to give you an idea of how we’re presently applying the concept of “doing the hard things” to be happy in our daily lives:  Ready to get started? It’s time to think of moments when you are most likely to give in to impulses that keep you stuck and take you farther away from your best intentions.  Then use your written “notes to self” as visual reminders to interrupt those negative impulses and keep yourself on track. And, if you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU. Which “note to self” — or “hard thing” — mentioned above resonates with you the most today, and why?

One Simple Thing is Absolutely Necessary to Be an Expert (and Get What You Want in Life)|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/one-simple-thing-expert.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| May your actions speak louder than your words. May your life preach louder than your lips. May your success be your noise in the end. The result of enormous success is often pretty noisy — lots of people talking, writing, and sharing stories about it. The actual process of achieving enormous success, on the other hand, is far more discreet. But it’s this process that happens quietly, behind-the-scenes, that makes all the difference in the world. Marc and I are fortunate enough to know a number of enormously successful human beings. Regardless of lifestyle, industry or profession, they share many of the same quiet habits. And that’s precisely what I want to discuss with you today. Here are twelve key things the most successful people we know do quietly and diligently: [Read more…]  Let’s cut to the chase today. What you ultimately do in life comes out of who you believe you are. You have to practice believing in yourself and ignoring the naysayers. Because while you may not be able to control the impolite and unfair things some people say and do, you can press forward and decide not to be endlessly derailed by them. Of course, I know that’s all much easier said than done, but you must remind yourself that it can be done! How? Start by leveraging the right daily affirmations. After all, it’s not what others say about you, and it’s not what you broadcast to everyone else that determines the trajectory of your life. It’s what you whisper to yourself behind [Read more…]  You ultimately become what you repeatedly do. If your habits aren’t helping you, they’re hurting you. Here are some fairly common and widespread examples of the latter that will drain all your joy if you let them: Try to use frustration and inconvenience to motivate you rather than annoy you. You are in control of the way you look at life. Instead of getting angry, find the lesson. In place of envy, feel admiration. In place of worry, take action. In place of doubt, have faith. Remember that your response is always more powerful than your present circumstance. A small part of your life is decided by completely uncontrollable circumstances, while the vast majority of your life is decided by your responses. Where you ultimately end up is heavily dependent on [Read more…]  A good morning, and thus a good day, aren’t just experiences that magically happen — they are created consciously. Most of us are distracted from the get-go every morning. Trivial activities like checking social media, watching TV, and worrying about things we can’t control often set the tone of the day. And that means we waste our most well-rested time on things that don’t matter, while gradually losing touch with the significant, controllable parts of our lives that actually do matter. We simply forget that the morning hours are enormously important — they form the foundation from which the day is built. We forget that how we choose to spend these hours can be used to predict the kind of days we’re going to have, and ultimately the kind of lives we’re going to live. So if you feel like you’ve been getting a rough start lately, and stumbling through your days with diminished intention and focus, it’s time to consider [Read more…]  Perhaps it takes courage to raise children… Our youth can’t possibly know how age thinks and feels. And likewise, as we age we are often guilty of being so busy-brained that we forget what it was like to be young. Spending time with my young son helps me tap into my younger mind — he keeps me on my toes. For that I am grateful, but I still struggle as a parent. I struggle to be present. I struggle to be patient. I struggle to remember. Almost every single day. Truth be told, every parent battles with parenthood in their own way. Because parenting is not easy. What helps me is journaling about the lessons parenthood is gradually teaching me, and then referring back to what I’ve learned when I’m struggling and forgetful. Today, I want to share some quotes from my parenting journal with you. Perhaps they will assist you someday, the way they have assisted me again this morning… [Read more…] 40 Summer Journaling Prompts that Will Take Your Mind Off Things|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/40-daily-journaling-prompts.jpg?resize=500%2C375&ssl=1| Don’t just think outside the box this summer… Think like there is no box. Ease your worried mind by tuning out the excess noise in your head for a little while every day.  It’s summertime after all, and there’s no reason not to take your mind off (the wrong) things and find a little extra peace. You know how you always turn down the volume on the radio when you need to a moment to think clearly? The same is true for your life in general.  The noise you need to cut out first?  That’s the mental noise you hear all too often—the busy, worried thoughts screaming over your sanity. Turning down the radio refocuses your mind and offers you peace and clarity when you need it most.  You don’t really think about how or why this makes such a huge difference, you just know that it does. Now it’s time to apply this same strategy to all the other noise in your life, starting with the noise in your head.  And although it’s not quite as easy as spinning the radio’s volume dial, the good news is you can quiet your mind and train it to think more peacefully and rationally simply by reminding yourself to do so every day. The best tool for the job this summer? It’s just a simple practice of self-reflection that keeps you on track by keeping peaceful, productive thoughts at the top of your mind, even when life gets noisy. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, if you want to get somewhere in life, you need a map, and your journal is that map.  You can write down what you did today, what you tried to accomplish, where you made mistakes, and so much more.  It’s a place to reflect.  It’s a place to capture important thoughts and eliminate the rest.  It’s a place to sort out where you’ve been and where you intend to go.  And it’s one of the most underused, yet incredibly effective tools available to the masses. If you’re interested in getting started with journaling this summer, or if you’d like some fresh ideas for your current journaling practice, I’ve listed 40 journaling prompts below that I’m personally using this summer to take my mind off things and nudge myself into a calmer state of being.  They will bring awareness to the nagging subconscious beliefs and assumptions you have.  And they will help you filter out the noise, be more present, and make better decisions. Challenge yourself to read and write on each prompt for at least ten minutes every day for the next 40 days, and then simply start over again—keep going until the end of summer.  See how doing so gradually changes how you think, feel and behave… The goal isn’t to get rid of all your negative thoughts, feelings, and life situations this summer.  That’s impossible.  The goal is to change your response to them. What’s something small that’s been stressing you out recently?  What can you do to improve your response today? One of the most important moments in life is the moment you finally find the courage to let go of what can’t be changed.  Because when you are no longer able to change a situation, you are challenged to change yourself—to grow beyond the unchangeable.  And that changes everything. What’s one unchangeable reality you’ve been resisting recently?  What can you do right now to ease your mind into the acceptance of this reality? Love what you do, until you can do what you love.  Love where you are, until you can be where you love.  Love the people you are with, until you can be with the people you love most.  This is the way we find happiness, opportunity, and peace. What do you love about your present life situation (despite the challenges that exist)?  Who do you love today (despite the quirks they have)? Peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no chaos, trouble, or hard realities to deal with.  Peace means to be in the midst of all those things and still remain mentally, emotionally, and physically centered. What’s something small that always brings you peace when you think about it?  Why? Oftentimes you don’t even realize you’re blocking your own present blessings by holding on to the past.  Do your best to let go.  You are not your bad days.  You are not your mistakes.  You are not your scars.  You are not your past.  Be here now and breathe. Who are you in this moment, without the baggage? Do not waste your energy fighting against where you are.  Rather, invest your energy into getting to where you want to go.  Let go of everything from the past that does not serve you in this moment, and just be grateful it brought you to where you are now—to this new beginning. What’s something about the present moment that makes it the perfect time to begin (again)? Too often we say “life is not fair” while we’re eating our food, sipping a drink, and reading tweets on our smartphones.  Think twice and be thankful.  Right now, before you think of anything else, breathe deeply, appreciate where you are, and see the value in what you have. What’s one privilege you have that you often take for granted? Happiness is letting go of what you assume your life is supposed to be like right now and sincerely appreciating it for everything that it is.  At the end of this day, before you close your eyes, smile and be at peace with where you’ve been and grateful for what you have.  Life is good. What do you appreciate most about your present life situation?  Why? As you age, you’ll learn to value your time, genuine relationships, meaningful work, and peace of mind, much more.  Little else will matter.  Thus, the strongest sign of your growth is realizing you’re no longer worried or stressed by the trivial things that once used to drain you. What’s something that used to drive you crazy, but no longer bothers you?  Why? What you focus on grows.  Stop managing your time.  Start managing your focus.  99% of what stressed you out recently won’t even matter a month from now.  Shake off the nonsense, bring your attention back to what’s important, and move forward with your life. What is truly worth focusing on today?  What is NOT? Everything gets a bit uncomfortable when it’s time to change.  That’s just a part of the growth process.  Things will get better.  Be patient and remind yourself: Life never gets easier, you just get stronger. How has the discomfort you’ve felt in the past helped you grow?  How can you better accept the discomfort you presently feel? You can disappoint people and still be good enough.  You can fail and still be smart, capable and talented.  You can let people down and still be worthwhile and deserving of love and admiration.  We all make mistakes sometimes.  Take a deep breath.  You are allowed to be human. How does giving yourself full permission to be human feel right now?  How will you remind yourself to do this more often? It’s OK to… Say “no.”  Speak up.  Tell the truth.  Ask questions.  Believe differently.  Change your mind.  Prioritize your needs.  Learn from your mistakes.  Embrace your imperfections.  Forgive and seek forgiveness.  Begin again, stronger than before. What can you do to loosen the grip your have on yourself?  How can you give yourself a little extra space to make the right decisions today? Forgive yourself for the bad decisions you made, for the times you lacked understanding, for the choices that hurt others and yourself.  Forgive yourself, for being young and reckless.  These are all vital lessons.  And what matters most right now is your willingness to grow from them. What specifically do you need to forgive yourself for?  What have your error(s) in judgment taught you? Inner peace begins the moment you take a deep breath and choose not to allow another person or event to control your thoughts.  You are not what happened to you.  You are what you choose to become in this moment.  Let go, breathe, and begin again. What are you holding on to that’s holding you down?  What can you let go of right now (without losing a thing)? If you wait until you feel 100% ready, you will be waiting the rest of your life.  Realize this!  Some people wait all day for 5pm, all week for Friday, all year for the holidays, all their lives for happiness.  Don’t be one of them. What’s one (true) reason you’re good enough and ready enough, right now? We waste our time waiting for the ideal path to appear.  But it never does.  Because we forget that paths are made by walking, not waiting.  And no, you shouldn’t feel more confident before you take the next step.  Taking the next step is what builds your confidence. What’s the next step you’ve been thinking about taking, for far too long? It’s funny how we outgrow what we once thought we couldn’t live without, and then we fall in love with what we didn’t even know we wanted.  Life keeps leading us on journeys we would never go on if it were up to us.  Don’t be afraid.  Have faith.  Find the lessons.  Trust the journey. What’s something you’ve moved on from that once meant the world to you?  And, what’s something you love today that you never even knew you needed in your life? Even when it seems personal, rarely do people do things because of you, they do things because of them.  You know this is true.  You may not be able control all the things people say and do to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.  Make that decision for yourself today. What’s something you often take too personally even though, logically, you know better?  How does consciously removing this burden from your mind in this moment feel? When someone upsets us, this is often because they aren’t behaving according to our fantasy of how they “should” behave.  The frustration, then, stems not from their behavior but from how their behavior differs from our fantasy.  Let’s not get carried away.  Remember, calmness is a superpower. How can you let calmness be your superpower today, instead? Don’t lower your standards, but do remember that removing your expectations of others is the best way to avoid being disappointed by them.  You will end up sadly disappointed if you expect people will always do for you as you do for them.  Not everyone has the same heart as you. How have your expectations of others gotten the best of you recently?  How will you remind yourself to ease your expectations today? Everybody you meet is afraid of something, loves something, and has lost something.  Know this.  Respect this.  And be extra kind.  Take time to really listen.  Take time to learn something new.  Take time to say thank you, today. What can you easily do to be a little kinder than usual today?  And, who was the last person who was unexpectedly kind to you?  Let this sink in, and carry on accordingly. You can’t control how other people receive your energy.  Whatever someone interprets or projects onto you is at least partially an issue or problem that they themselves are dealing with, which has nothing to do with you.  Just keep doing your thing with as much love and integrity as possible. What’s one good, recent example of someone with a negative attitude completely misjudging you? You will never find your worth in another human being—you find it in yourself, and then you will attract those who are worthy of your energy.  Realize this.  Accept and acknowledge your own worth.  Stop waiting for others to tell you how important you are.  Tell yourself.  And believe it.. What’s one little thing that makes you worthy in your own eyes right now? You won’t always be a priority to others, and that’s why you have to be a priority to yourself.  Learn to respect yourself, take care of yourself, and become your own support system.  Your needs matter.  Start meeting them.  Don’t wait on others to choose you.  Choose yourself, today! Why do you often turn to others for the support you can easily give to yourself?  How will you choose yourself today? A tiny part of your life is decided by uncontrollable circumstances, while the vast majority of it is decided by your perspective of these circumstances.  Let this sink in.  Regardless of what’s going on around you, peace of mind arrives the moment you come to peace with what’s on your mind. What is one reality you need to come to peace with?  Why? When things aren’t adding up in your life, begin subtracting.  Life gets a lot simpler when you clear the clutter that makes it complicated.  Fill your life with lots of experiences, not lots of things.  Have incredible stories to tell, not incredible clutter in your closets. What forms of clutter have been complicating your life and diverting you from meaningful experiences?  How can you simplify and clear some space for yourself today? There’s a big difference between giving up and starting over in the right direction.  Know when enough is enough already, and respect yourself for feeling that way.  Sometimes we have to say goodbye before we can say hello.  Sometimes we have to let go to move forward with our lives. What’s something from your past that you are thankful you gave up on?  Just let this sink in right now. Stop rushing.  Breathe.  Be where you are.  You’re where you’re supposed to be at this moment.  There’s a time and place for everything, and every step is necessary.  Just keep doing your best, and don’t force what’s not yet supposed to fit into your life.  When it’s meant to be, it will be. What is necessary and true about where you are right now?  How does it feel to embrace this present reality? Just breathe, be, and pay attention to what it’s like to be YOU.  Nothing to fix.  Nothing to change.  Nowhere else to go.  Just you, breathing, being, with presence, without judgment.  You are welcome here.  You belong here.  Here, you are enough.  Close your eyes.  Breathe… What’s something true about you that you need to embrace more openly and lovingly? Give yourself the space to hear your own voice—your own soul.  Too many of us listen to the noise of the world and get lost in the crowd.  Stand strong!  Live by choice, not by chance.  Work to grow, not compete.  Choose to listen to yourself, not the jumbled opinions of everyone else. What has your inner voice been trying to tell you today? Forget popularity.  Just do your thing with passion, humility, and honesty.  Do what you do, not for an applause, but because it’s what’s right.  Pursue it a little bit each day, no matter what anyone else thinks.  That’s how dreams are achieved. What’s something that’s worth working on today, regardless of what other people think?  Why is it important to you? If it entertains you now but will hurt or bore you someday, it’s a distraction.  Don’t settle.  Don’t exchange what you want most for what you kind of want at the moment.  Study your habits.  Figure out where your time goes, and remove distractions.  It’s time to focus on what matters. What distractions have been getting the best of you lately?  How will you refocus your energy? Don’t fall back into your old patterns of living just because they’re more comfortable and easier to access.  Remember, you left certain habits and situations behind for a reason: to improve your life.  And right now, you can’t move forward if you keep going back. What’s one old pattern of behavior that sometimes still sneaks up on you?  What’s a better alternative today, and why? Love what you do, until you can do what you love.  Love where you are, until you can be where you love.  Love the people you are with, until you can be with the people you love most.  This is the way we find happiness, opportunity, and peace. How will you embody “love” today?  What does this mean to you? The older we grow, the more peaceful we become.  Life humbles us gradually as we age.  We realize how much nonsense we’ve wasted time on.  So, just do your best right now to feel the peace that flows from your decision to rise above the petty drama that doesn’t really matter. What kind of drama do you sometimes get caught up in?  What can you do to rise above it? You become a true master of your life when you learn how to master your focus—where your attention goes.  Value what you give your energy to.  Rise above the pettiness trying to draw you in.  Focus on what matters.  Where attention goes, energy flows.  Where energy flows, things grow. What truly DOES matter to you most right now? It’s not too late.  You aren’t behind.  You’re exactly where you need to be.  Every step is necessary.  Don’t judge or berate yourself for how long your journey is taking.  We all need our own time to travel our own distance.  Give yourself credit.  And be thankful you made it this far. How far have you come?  How much have you grown?  Think about the specifics of your recent and long-term growth.  What have you not given yourself enough credit for?  Give yourself credit right now. You’re not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or a week ago.  You’re always growing.  Experiences don’t stop.  That’s life.  And the very experiences that seem so hard when you’re going through them are the ones you’ll look back on with gratitude for how far you’ve come. What’s the hardest thing you’re trying to accomplish or cope with right now?  What is something small and necessary about this struggle? There will come a time when you think it’s all over, everything is finished… you’ve reached the end of the road.  That’s the starting line.  Be humble.  Be teachable.  The world is bigger than your view of the world.  There’s always room for a new idea, a new step… a new beginning. What does “a new beginning” mean to you right now? Are you willing to spend a little time every day like most people won’t, so you can spend the better part of your life like most people can’t? Think about that question for a moment. For the longest time I knew the value of journaling—I heard the success stories of others—and yet I never cracked open my journal consistently.  Why?  Because I thought I didn’t have enough time for it.  I was “too busy.”  That was, until my ongoing negligence led to heightened levels of stress—continuous mental noise—that literally put me in a hospital (my life was so disordered and hectic, I started having panic attacks). I learned the hard way, but YOU don’t have to. Consider this my attempt to shake you awake and get you started with a small, life-changing ritual of daily journaling.  And note my emphasis on “daily.”  Because the journaling prompts above mean almost nothing if they are not practiced consistently.  One day of journaling by itself won’t cut it. It is the compound effect of simple, seemingly ordinary actions over time that leads to life-altering, positive results. Consider this quick quote from our New York Times bestselling book: “There is nothing immediately sensational about putting one foot in front of the other every day for weeks, but by doing so, many normal human beings have climbed over 29,000 feet to the top of the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest.” And, there is nothing immediately exciting about forcing yourself into self-reflection through journaling for a short time every day, but by doing so, I (and hundreds of course students and conference attendees Angel and I have personally worked with) have drastically better lives. Remember, the mind needs to be trained to gain strength.  It needs to be worked consistently to grow and develop over time.  And that’s precisely what a daily ritual of journaling will gradually allow you to achieve.  (Note: Angel and I build more small, life-changing daily rituals like this with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy Course.) The most fundamental aggression to ourselves and others—the most fundamental harm we can do to human nature as a whole—is to remain ignorant by not making the time to pause every day and look at ourselves and others carefully, honestly and gently. With this in mind, I’d love to hear your thoughts about this article and the morning journaling prompts.  What resonated with you?  What didn’t?  Is there anything else you would add?

One Insanely Popular Love Story that Breaks Too Many Hearts|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/one-heartbreaking-relationship-fantasy.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| We make our relationships so much harder than they need to be.  The difficulties started when conversations became texting, feelings became subliminal, sex became a game, the word “love” fell out of context, trust faded as honesty waned, insecurities became a way of living, jealously became a cyclical routine, being hurt started to feel natural… and running away from it all became our go-to solution.  Let’s stop running!  Let’s start working together to face these issues—to break the cycle, to communicate, to appreciate, to forgive, and to LOVE the people in our lives who deserve it. How? The first step is letting go of the heartbreaking cultural story—or fairy tale—of “happily ever after.” Our always-in-your-face, airbrushed media culture—with its continuous stream of picture-perfect highlight reels—has built the expectation in us that life is supposed to be like an endless day at Disney World.  And nowhere does our media culture present a more skewed set of expectations than around our relationships.  We are swayed to believe a great relationship is all sunshine and roses, despite the fact that most of us have witnessed firsthand plenty of examples to the contrary. It’s time to get our heads wrapped around this once and for all! Human relationships require effort and compromise.  They require two people to practice patience and presence, and thoughtfully extend themselves for the sake of the other.  They require us to redefine the fairy tale story of love that our media culture has attempted to brainwash us with. It’s time to take a stand and acknowledge the fact that we’ve been fed lies most of our lives.  We’ve been told that love is a feeling worth finding, but the reality is that love is an action worth investing in.  It’s something two people must commit to as a daily ritual. When you’re able to accept this new reality, and get past the fantasy about things needing to be magical all the time, you make room for the real joy of engaging deeply in a real relationship, which holds a powerful, flexible space that widens itself to accommodate the necessary struggles. Let this sink in right now… When your marriage, friendship, parenting, etc. gets difficult, it’s not an immediate sign that you’re doing it wrong.  These intimate, intricate relationships are toughest when you’re doing them right—when you’re dedicating time, having the tough conversations, and making sacrifices for each other. Truth be told, there is no soul mate, best friend or family member out there who will solve all your problems.  There is no love at first sight that lasts without work and commitment.  But there are, of course, people out there worth fighting for.  Not because it’s easy, but because they’re worth it.  Not because they’re perfect, but because they’re imperfect in all the ways that are right for you.  You challenge each other’s thinking and behavior, but also support each other’s ability to change and grow.  You complement each other’s flaws in a way that allows your souls to unite and operate more efficiently as one over the long run. The awareness of all this, as you know, is often incredibly hard to come by.  Especially in the beginning.  And to that end, let me share a quick true story with you about one of our newest course students (I’m sharing this with permission): About a decade ago on his 37th birthday, after spending his entire adult life loosely dating different women, he finally decided he was ready to settle down.  He wanted to find a real mate… a lover… a life partner—someone who could show him what it meant to be in a deep, monogamous, trusting relationship. So, he searched far and wide.  There were so many women to choose from, all with great qualities, but none with everything he was looking for.  And then, finally, just when he thought he would never find her, he found her.  And she was perfect.  She had everything he ever wanted in a woman.  And he rejoiced, for he knew how rare a find she was.  “I’ve done my research,” he told her.  “You are the one for me.” But as the days and weeks turned into months and years, he started to realize that she was far from perfect.  She had issues with trust and self-confidence, she liked to be silly when he wanted to be serious, and she was much messier than he was.  And he started to have doubts … doubts about her, doubts about himself, doubts about everything. And to validate these doubts, he subconsciously tested her.  He constantly looked around their apartment for things that weren’t clean just to prove that she was messy.  He decided to go out alone to parties with his single guy friends just to prove that she had trust issues.  He set her up and waited for her to do something silly just to prove she couldn’t be serious.  It went on like this for awhile. As the tests continued—and as she, clearly shaken and confused, failed more and more often—he became more and more convinced that she was not a perfect fit for him after all.  Because he had dated women in the past who were more mature, more confident, and more willing to have serious conversations. Inevitably, he found himself at a crossroads.  Should he continue to be in a relationship with a woman who he once thought was perfect, but now realizes is lacking the qualities that he already found in the other women that came before her?  Or should he return to the lifestyle he had come from, drifting from one empty relationship to the next? After he enrolled in our Getting Back to Happy Course a few days ago, desperately looking for answers, this is the gist of what Angel and I told him: One of the greatest lessons we learn in life is that we are often attracted to a bright light in another person.  Initially, this light is all we see.  It’s so bright and beautiful.  But after a while, as our eyes adjust, we notice this light is accompanied by a shadow… and oftentimes a fairly large one. When we see this shadow, we have two choices: we can either shine our own light on the shadow or we can run from it and continue searching for a shadow-less light. If we decide to run from the shadow, we must also run from the light that created it.  And we soon find out that our light is the only light illuminating the space around us.  Then, at some point, as we look closer at our own light, we notice something out of the ordinary.  Our light is casting a shadow too.  And our shadow is bigger and darker than some of the other shadows we’ve seen. If, on the other hand, instead of running from the shadow, we decide to walk towards it, something amazing happens.  We inadvertently cast our own light on the shadow, and likewise, the light that created this shadow casts its light on ours.  Gradually, both shadows begin to disappear.  Not completely, of course, but every part of the two shadows that are touched by the other person’s light illuminate and disappear. And, as a result, we each find more of that bright beautiful light in the other person. Which is precisely what we have been searching for all along. Let’s consciously remind ourselves, again and again, that there is no shadow-less light. Let’s embrace the fact that the deepest craving of human nature is the need to be appreciated as is, and that too often we try to be sculptors, constantly carving out of others the image of what we want them to be—what we think we need, love, or desire.  But these actions and perceptions are against reality, against their benefit and ours, and always end in disappointment. The foundation of love is to let those we care about be unapologetically themselves, and to not distort them to fit our own egotistical ideas of who they should be.  Otherwise we fall in love only with our own fantasies, and thus miss out entirely on their true beauty. So, today… And remember, relationships of all kinds are rarely 50/50 at any given instant in time.  You can’t always feel 100%, or a full 50% of a relationship’s whole—life is simply too unpredictable for that.  So, on the days when you can only give 20%, the other person must give 80%, and vice versa.  It’s never been about balancing steady in the middle.  Healthy relationships are about two people who are willing to make adjustments for each other in real time as needed, and give a little more when the other person can’t help but give a little less. Yes, it’s a practice, love is.  A daily rehearsal of honesty, presence, communication, acceptance, forgiveness, sacrifice and stretching the heart and mind through new and vulnerable dimensions. Let’s practice, together. Today. We would love to hear from YOU.

"5 Lessons I Learned from Overcoming the Hardest Days of My Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-lessons-hardest-days.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| The biggest and most complex obstacle you will ever have to overcome is your own mind.  Overcome that, and you can overcome anything! Of course, that’s way easier to say than to do, especially when life as you know it starts falling apart… Just over a decade ago, Marc and I had to deal with several painful life changes.  These included: It all happened so quickly, too!  The pain of those experiences compounded on one another in quick succession, knocking us down and driving the wind right out of our sails for a couple years straight.  At times, we felt like we had absolutely no strength left to push onward. But, as we navigated our new reality one step at a time—facing the pain instead of distracting ourselves from it—we stumbled across morsels of strength and wisdom that we began to collect and build on.  We gradually learned how to catch ourselves in negative states of emotional turmoil, so we could overcome the emotions that had once overcome us.  All details aside, we pushed ourselves as hard as we could to take one tiny step every day—one journal entry, one 10-minute workout, one honest conversation, and so forth.  It wasn’t easy, but the tiny steps were manageable and we gradually grew stronger. And with each passing day, we saw more beauty hidden in life’s most painful changes. You see, the most painful changes in life—even deaths—are simply endings, which are all a necessary part of living.  And all endings are necessary for beauty, too—otherwise it’s impossible to appreciate someone or something, because they are unlimited.  Limits illuminate beauty—they are reminders that we need to be aware of this beautiful person or situation, and appreciate this beautiful thing called life.  Every ending is also a beginning, because while we have lost someone or something special, this ending, like every loss, is a moment of reinvention.  Although heartbreaking, it forces us to reinvent our lives, and in this reinvention is an opportunity to experience beauty in new, unseen ways and places.  And, of course, every ending is an opportunity to celebrate the beautiful, ever-changing journey we’re on, and to be grateful for what it has showed us and taught us along the way. Getting to this point of understanding—changing your perspective—again, is far from easy.  But it’s honestly worth every bit of effort you can muster, no matter how many times you need to remind yourself. Because we so easily forget how important it is to face the unexpected losses and painful life changes we’re going to encounter no matter how much we try to avoid them—to face down our pain and negative thinking and leverage it to get back up and take the next step.  Yes, we need to be reminded to actually get up and DO the hard things we need to do to be happy again.  The things that frighten us.  The things others can’t do for us.  The things that make the difference between existing and living—between knowing the path and walking the path—between a life of empty promises and defeat and one filled with renewed happiness, possibility and peace. And that’s why Marc and I wrote our brand new book, Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs, to be that daily reminder for anyone who’s struggling to change their situation for the better.  It’s a dynamic and actionable guide for taking life day by day and focusing on the little things that make a lasting difference.  This book represents the culmination of hundreds of hours of work with course students, live event attendees, and lots of one-on-one work with each other, too…  “With the help of Marc and Angel’s hard-won insights, we can always find a way to pick ourselves up, reframe our mindset to see the bigger picture, and take that first step back to happy.” —Alyssa Milano Yes, that’s a quick snippet of what Alyssa Milano had to say in the foreword to Getting Back to Happy. But, why did a famous, renowned actress and activist like her decide to write this foreword for a couple of coaches and authors like us? Perhaps another slightly longer snippet from her foreword will clarify things: “In my own journey to uncover who I truly am, and to find—and use—my voice for what I believe in, I’ve been lucky enough to meet many kindred spirits along the way, many of them online.  Marc and Angel are among the fellow travelers I’ve come to value the most.  Their honesty and clarity, and the generous way they share what they’ve learned for themselves, are gifts I’ve truly cherished.  Sharing their ideas with others online is a way of paying forward what I’ve learned, in the hope that others will gain some insight and strength, and in turn spread the word even further.  The pain of self-doubt and the isolation of modern life can make us feel like we’re the only ones struggling, while everyone else is picture-perfect.  That’s why it’s so important to share not just our triumphs but also our setbacks, to “show our work” when we’re in the thick of tough times.  Marc and Angel do just that—keeping it real, and creating a community of kindred spirits that gathers together in strength, growing and learning along the way.” —Alyssa Milano In life our insights are often hard won, as Alyssa points out.  And, ten years ago, when Marc and I were desperately struggling after losing two loved ones back-to-back to suicide and illness, we decided to be transparent about our story, our struggles, and our depression.  And we also decided to share the tiny daily steps we were taking to cope, to heal, to grow, and ultimately to get our lives back on track.  We shared all of this online via Facebook, Twitter, email, and our blog, and Alyssa was one of the people who resonated with our story and followed our journey right from the get-go… because she found personal value in what we were sharing. And then, she continued to follow our work over the years that followed, primarily because we didn’t stop sharing what we were learning. As Marc and I have learned—and as you’ve probably encountered too—there’s little doubt that our most important insights come directly from our hardest challenges.  But we can also take these insights and pay them forward, sharing them with others in hopes that our insights might shine a light for other people who are struggling down their own paths. The opportunity to pay forward what we’ve learned inspires us continuously in our work, whether it’s through our blog, our renowned Getting Back to Happy course and coaching, our annual Think Better Live Better conference, our books, and everything else we do.  And, it’s also one of the biggest reasons we wrote our newest book, also titled Getting Back to Happy, as you know.  Everything we’ve learned in the past decade of coaching and teaching others about how to build a happier life is distilled into this book. Never before have we put it all in one place like this in such an accessible way. In fact, here’s a sneak peek of the table of contents, so you can get an idea of what Getting Back to Happy has to offer: When we reached out to Alyssa and shared the idea and outline of the book with her, she immediately said “yes” to writing the foreword.  Specifically, she said she was “honored to be given the chance to continue paying it forward.” Getting Back to Happy is honestly the book we’ve wanted to write ever since we started on this journey, one that began with our personal struggle and evolved into a multifaceted coaching practice that has positively impacted the lives of thousands of amazing people, just like Alyssa. I sincerely wish I could have read it a decade ago.  In many ways, it would have saved me from myself.  It absolutely would have saved me from intense periods of darkness that were born primarily from my subconscious attempt to take the easy way out of the painful realities I faced. So yes, this is a big deal, and we’re excited to share Getting Back to Happy with YOU (which will be officially released this Tuesday).  In fact, we’re so excited that we’re also giving away over $50 in bonuses to the first 2,000 blog readers that pre-order the book (including One Day at a Time, our 60-day workbook for implementing rewarding, lifelong rituals, and Daily Reminders We Need to Read Every Morning, with prompts that guide you to start each day in a mindful state, so you can focus and get the right things done).  You’ll want to act quickly, though, because we already have 1,907 pre-orders booked as of this morning. 🙂 Order Getting Back to Happy and get your free bonuses right now (use the form here to submit your receipt). Also, if you haven’t done so already, check out this 2-minute video (the official book trailer):  Above all, what you need to remember is that it’s ultimately your choice… Yes, it’s your choice.YOUR choice.You are choosing right now. And if you’re choosing…to complain…to blame…to be stuck in the past…to act like a victim…to feel insecure…to feel anger…to feel hate…to be naïve…to ignore your intuition…to ignore good advice…to give up… …then it’s time to choose differently. But, let me also remind you that you are not alone.  Generations of human beings in your family tree have chosen.  Human beings around the world have chosen.  We all have chosen at one time or another.  And we stand behind you now whispering: Choose to let go.Choose to be present.Choose to be positive.Choose to forgive yourself.Choose to forgive others.Choose to see your value.Choose to see the possibilities.Choose to find meaning.Choose to prove you’re not a victim. Choose to do the hard things you need to do, so you can take a step forward… and then pay it forward.  (We show HOW in Getting Back to Happy.) And of course, if there’s anything else Marc and I can do to assist you, please don’t hesitate to leave a reply below. PS. Pre-ordering the new book on or before the official release on Tuesday helps us out tremendously.  We’d greatly appreciate YOUR SUPPORT today. PPS. I’m also excited (and pretty darn nervous) to announce that Marc and I will be on NBC’s Megyn Kelly TODAY show Monday, May 21 to support Getting Back to Happy’s release. Tune in if you’re able…  How to Change the Way You Feel (Without Changing Anything Else)|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/2-change-the-way-you-feel.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| Happiness does not start with a relationship, a degree, a job, or money.  It starts with your thinking and what you tell yourself today. “I had a date scheduled for last night with this guy I started talking to on a dating app.  I waited outside the diner where we agreed to meet for 30 minutes past the time we were supposed to meet.  He never showed up.  All sorts of negative thoughts were running through my head.  I thought maybe he saw me from a distance, didn’t like what he saw, and then bailed. Just as I was about to leave, one of my old college friends, Jared, who I haven’t seen in nearly a decade, walked up to me with a huge smile on his face and said, ‘Carly!  It’s great to see you!  You look fantastic!’  I almost blew him off because of how I felt inside at the moment.  But luckily I pulled myself together to engage in a conversation. After we talked in that same spot for awhile, he said, ‘What are you doing for dinner?’  We ended up going into the diner I was supposed to eat at with the no-show date and having an amazing conversation filled with laughter.  After dinner he walked me to my car, we exchanged numbers, and he asked me out on a formal date for this Friday night.” The story above comes from Carly, one of our recent Think Better, Live Better 2019 attendees (and of course, we’re sharing her story with permission). Think about how her initial reaction was rooted so heavily in negativity.  Her date didn’t show up and she immediately crumbled inside.  Now think about the amazing opportunity she would have missed if she had let that negativity endure.  And think about how often your negativity gets the best of you. How often do let your insecurities stop you? Or, how often do you judge others for their imperfections? What you need to realize right now is that you have a story about yourself and others (or perhaps a series of stories) that you recite to yourself daily.  This is your mental movie, and it’s a feature film that plays on repeat in your mind.  Your movie is about who you are and how the world is supposed to be: your tummy is too flabby, your skin is too dark or too pale, you aren’t smart, you aren’t lovable… you aren’t good enough.  And of course, you catch yourself picking out all sorts of imperfections in others, and the world at large, too. Start to pay attention when your movie plays—when you feel anxiety about being who you are or facing the realities of life—because it affects everything you do.  Realize that this movie isn’t real, it isn’t true, and it isn’t you.  It’s just a train of thought that can be stopped—a script that can be rewritten. Ready to rewrite the script? Let’s start by being honest… Sometimes negativity absolutely dominates our better judgment! So, how do we outsmart our own negative tendencies so we can feel better, behave better, and ultimately live better?  There are many ways, but Angel and I often recommend two simple (but not easy) practices to our live event attendees and course students: You know what they say, don’t believe everything you hear nor everything you read.  Don’t believe the gossip columns in every magazine, the doom and gloom predictions from your co-workers, or the “shocking news” that you hear on TV… until you have verified it. Well, the same concept applies to your inside world—your thoughts. We all have stories about ourselves and others even if we don’t think of them as stories.  Case in point:  How often do you pause to logically contemplate what you really think about your relationships, your habits, or your challenges?  How often, on the other hand, do you just blurt out whatever fleeting emotion comes to mind—i.e., the pre-recorded movie script you’ve been holding on to—without even thinking straight? Stories can be short, such as “I’m not a good writer,” “I’m not good at yoga,” or “I have intrinsic relationship problems.”  And if we were to dig deeper into your own personal version of these stories, I bet you’d be happy to go on and try to explain why the stories you’ve been holding onto are real.  Even though the aren’t.  They’re just stories. So the key practice here is to question your stories.  For instance, let’s take the writer example.  Ask yourself: Why do I think I am not a good writer?  What would it look like to be a good writer?  Can I describe my current writing in a way that serves me better? You will be surprised by how often the questioning process helps you emerge with a clearer and more accurate version of your story.  Give it a try! Sometimes you are in a hurry, and not having a great day to boot.  On days like this, there’s a mental conditioning exercise I recommend that’s super quick and can help keep your attitude in check… I’ve been in arguments with my my wife, Angel, in the past and one of the things I certainly regretted was not filtering my words before saying them.  At the time of these arguments, I did not have the right tools, except for thinking “Be nice!”, which does nothing for you when you’re feeling the opposite of nice.  Some years later I found this simple tool that helped me shift my behavior.  Here’s how it works: Before you utter anything, run your thoughts through three key filters and don’t speak unless you get three resounding “YES” responses: For example, let’s say a running thought in your head says that your partner doesn’t care about you, and you are about to shout those words out because he or she didn’t do the last chore you requested.  Question that thought first: Is it true that my partner doesn’t care about me?  Is it kind for me to say or think this?  Is it helpful for me to say or think this? Remember you can’t take your words back.  What’s more, you will never regret behaving in a true, kind and helpful way down the road.  So make it a ritual in your life in the days and weeks ahead. Leverage the two practices above to gradually rewrite the script of your mental movie.  Learn to recognize the worn-out flicker of your old movie starting up, and then stop it.  Seriously!  Whenever you catch yourself reciting lines from your old script (“My arms are flabby…” or “My spouse deserves the silent treatment…”), flip the script and replace those lines with truer, kinder and more helpful ones.  This takes some practice, but it’s worth it.  Just keep practicing, and forgiving yourself for making mistakes along the way. And keep in mind that various kinds of external negativity will attempt to distract you from your new script and your better judgment—comments from family, news anchors, social media posts… lots of things other people say and do.  When you sense negativity coming at you, learn to deflect it.  Give it a small push back with a thought like, “That remark is not really about me, it’s about you.”  Remember that all people have emotional issues they’re dealing with (just like you), and it makes them difficult and thoughtless sometimes.  They are doing the best they can, or they’re not even aware of their issues.  In any case, you can learn not to interpret their behaviors as personal attacks, and instead see them as non-personal encounters (like an obnoxious little dog barking in the distance) that you can either respond to gracefully, or not respond to at all.

The Art of Letting Go (to Heal a Broken Heart)|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/letting-go-broken-heart.jpg?resize=500%2C334&ssl=1| Choose Yourself Today: 7 Hard Choices that Will Make You Happier|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/choose-yourself-7-choices.jpg?resize=500%2C281&ssl=1| “Nothing can dim the light which shines from within.”— Maya Angelou It is what it is.  Accept it, learn from it, and grow from it.  It doesn’t matter what you’ve done; what truly matters is what you do from here. And what you need to remember right now is that you can’t heal yourself in the same exact environment where you got sick.  You need to surround yourself with situations and people that push you to heal and grow.  Less drama, less mess. Because the truth is, you won’t always be a priority to others—or to the world’s agenda at large—and that’s why you need to be a priority to yourself.  Learn to respect yourself, take care of yourself, and become your own support system.  Your needs matter.  Start meeting them. Don’t wait on others to choose you. Choose yourself, today! Choose to live your life today not as a bystander—not as a prisoner to the old environments and beliefs that sometimes keep you stuck.  But to instead live as an active participant, engaged in the new possibilities in front of you. That’s your choice!  YOUR choice! You are choosing right now… The Greek philosopher Epictetus said it perfectly more than 2,000 years ago: “People are disturbed, not by things (that happen to them), but by the principles and opinions which they form concerning (those) things.  When we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never attribute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own principles and opinions.” In other words, a peaceful and mentally strong person is not a someone who’s always in a good situation, but rather someone who always has a good attitude in every situation. Regardless of what you’re going though, it’s about choosing:  Will I allow this to upset me?  Will I choose to make this bad or good?  Will I choose to stay or walk away?  Will I choose to yell or whisper?  Will I choose to react or take the time to mindfully respond? When our course students come to us feeling down about a life situation they can’t control, we typically start by reinforcing the hard truth: sometimes changing your situation isn’t possible, or simply not possible soon enough.  You can’t get to a new job in an instant.  You can’t make someone else change against his or her will.  And you certainly can’t erase the past.  But… You CAN always choose an attitude that moves you forward.  And doing so will help you change things from the inside out, and ultimately allow you to grow beyond the struggles you can’t control. No matter what’s happening, you can resourcefully fight the battles of just one day.  It’s only when you add the battles of those two mind-bending eternities, yesterday and tomorrow, that life gets overwhelmingly intense and complicated. Accept that it’s not the experience of today that holds you back and drives you mad, but the regret and resentment about something that happened yesterday or the fear and dread of what tomorrow might bring, but probably won’t.  It’s necessary, then, to let yourself live just one day at a time – just today – just right here, right now. And this same strategy applies to your goals too—they don’t need to be so darn grandiose and convoluted that they frighten you.  If your goals excite you, and are broken down into manageable chunks, you’ll be compelled to move forward with them.  If they are based on what brings meaning into your life, not just what you think you “should” do, working on them will flow easier into each new day.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Goals & Success” chapter of our brand NEW edition of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) It really only takes a small shift everyday that over time amounts to enormous change. People don’t suddenly heal and start living their ideal life overnight—their daily rituals (tiny steps) play a massive role in making it possible for them to create the life they sincerely want to live. You can choose to develop daily rituals that point you in the direction of creating your ideal life—or rituals that keep you firmly anchored to your present situation.  Make the decision.  Make the commitment.  Then take the next tiniest step forward in the direction you choose to go. Honestly, that’s all life is—tiny, positive steps that you take moment by moment, and then one day when you look back it all adds up to something worthwhile – something that’s often far better, and different, than what you had imagined when you began your journey.  (Angel and I build tiny, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy Course.) After a couple decades of intentional soul searching, I finally figured out that there’s absolutely no benefit to holding on to anger, resentment or any of their close cousins.  Truthfully, I would not be the human being I am today if it weren’t for each and every life experience I’ve had.  And the same is true for you. Screwing up, making mistakes, and letting people down occasionally isn’t wrong—it’s being human. When I realized this truth, and accepted it, I opened my awareness to the fact that not everything, or perhaps even anything, that anyone else ever does is about me. Think about the last time you were unkind to someone.  Was it because of them, or because of you?  Perhaps you were just having a bad day at the time, right? Truth be told, if someone hurts you, chances are they have been hurt themselves.  So do your very best to never take anything too personally.  Don’t let vain insults get to your heart.  Most human beings can only give others what they have received themselves.  All of your actions and intentions should come from a place of love, but not everyone will be loving in return, and that’s perfectly OK. As Miguel Ruiz explained in his book The Four Agreements, when you do not take anything personally, you liberate yourself.  You can open yourself to the world, freely, and not have to worry about the judgments of others. It doesn’t matter if it’s your dad, sister, cousin, friend or coworker that’s spewing negativity at you, if they are bringing you down on a daily basis, you need to spend less time with them.  No, this doesn’t mean you have to exile them from your life – it simply means you can choose to carve out time away from them, to reclaim some positivity and sanity. There’s a big difference between accepting that someone’s negative actions or behavior is born from a place of anxiety or insecurity versus excusing their behavior and therefore enabling it to continue relentlessly in your life. We don’t have to condone a person’s negative behavior toward us, even though we may be compassionate, loving and understanding of its origins. At some point we all have to be accountable for our own well-being.  And quite honestly, if someone decides to lash out at you again and again, you’re not obligated to be a punching bag. Also, keep in mind that differing opinions are a part of life and relationships.  But when we come across people who are intent on delivering harsh criticism from the sidelines, sometimes we just have to tell ourselves that we may not be doing it perfectly in their eyes, but hey, at least we’re stepping up and doing it.  At least we’re getting up, showing up, walking into that darn arena every day and turning to face the crowd, shouting:  “Here I am, trying my best!  I’m a work in progress and I’m OK with it!” Think for a moment… If you were craving pizza, would you go to a Japanese sushi bar?  No!  Because you know they don’t serve pizza at a Japanese sushi bar.  In fact, they wouldn’t even have the right ingredients to make a pizza even if they were willing to customize a special order for you.  If you really wanted pizza, you would simply go to an Italian restaurant that serves it, right? Now think about the people you go to when you’re craving support, reassurance, guidance, healthy feedback, or simply a loving, listening ear.  Do you go to people who are consistently able to dish out what you are hungry for?  Or do you go to people who don’t have what you need on their menu, and thus find yourself endlessly discouraged and disappointed? Bottom line: It’s time to align your hunger with where you dine.  (Angel and I discuss this in detail in the “Relationships” chapter of our New York Times bestselling book, Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs.) Even though it’s true that life’s challenges make us stronger, and that it will be OK eventually… it’s not always OK right now, and sometimes that’s all we can feel when we’re in the midst of terribly tough times.  Sometimes NOT being OK is all we can register inside our tired brains and aching hearts.  This feeling is normal.  This emotion is human.  And accepting this can feel like a small weight lifted. The truth is, it’s not OK when someone you care about is no longer living and breathing and giving their amazing gifts to the world.  It’s not OK when everything falls apart and you’re buried deep in the wreckage of a life you had not planned for.  It’s not OK when the bank account is nearly at zero, with no clear sign of a promising income opportunity.  It’s not OK when someone you trusted betrays you and breaks your heart.  It’s not OK when you’re emotionally drained to the point you can’t get yourself out of bed in the morning.  It’s not OK when you’re engulfed in failure or shame or a grief like you’ve never known before. Whatever your tough times consist of, sometimes it’s just NOT OK right now.  And that, again, is more than OK. Yes, I’m suggesting to try your hardest to be perfectly OK with not being perfectly OK all the time.  Because those with the strength to succeed in the long run are the ones who lay a firm foundation of growth with the bricks life has thrown at them.  Don’t be afraid to fall apart for a little while, because when it happens, the situation will open an opportunity for you to grow and rebuild yourself into the brilliant human being you are capable of being, one brick at a time.

Stop Worrying About What Others Think of You: 7 Tips for Feeling Better|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-tips-stop-worrying-everyone.jpg?resize=500%2C307&ssl=1| When you’re feeling insecure, you typically don’t notice the hundreds of people around you who accept you just the way you are. All you notice are the few who don’t. In what way is the fear of rejection holding you back? How would your life be different if you didn’t (subconsciously) care what everyone thought about you? To answer these questions, we must understand that the vast majority of our fears and anxieties amount to one thing: Loss. We fear: We also fear, perhaps more than anything else, being rejected by others. This kind of fear is widespread and debilitating if left unaddressed. Why is this fear so deeply entrenched in us? In ancient tribal times, being rejected from the safety of the community could have meant death. So it’s no wonder, really, that we want to be accepted by others. Fear is an instinctual human emotion designed to keep us aware and safe – like the headlights on a car clearly illuminating the twists and turns on the road ahead. But too much fear, like high beams blinding us on a dark, foggy road, can cause the loss of the very thing we feared losing in the first place. This is especially true when it comes to fear of rejection. Let me give you an example from my own life: When I was a teenager, I was always the outcast trying desperately to fit in with my peers. I bounced around to three different schools, and various social circles in each school within a four-year time-span, and I faced rejection after rejection. I can distinctly remember shooting hoops on the basketball court by myself on numerous occasions, always the new kid, always longing for acceptance. For the longest time, I thought these childhood outcast experiences were the root cause of my obsessive, people-pleasing ways in my adulthood. In my twenties, I was always looking for signs that others didn’t like me. I would seek reassurance, always wondering what people really thought of me. Do you look for acceptance and reassurance from others, too? If so, you now know you’re not alone.  And what I’ve learned over the years is this: Constantly seeking acceptance and reassurance from other people is a dead end journey. These things can only be found within you, not from others. Because any look, word, or reaction from someone else can be warped and misinterpreted. In this post I want to share some tips that helped me feel self-assured, and eventually allowed me to overcome my fear of rejection and my relentless tenancy to worry about what everyone thought of me… Franklin D. Roosevelt so profoundly said, “Only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” Nothing could be closer to the truth. This is especially true as it relates to self-fulfilling prophecies. A self-fulfilling prophecy is a false belief about a situation that motivates the person with the belief to take actions that cause the belief to come true. This kind of thinking often kills opportunities and tears relationships apart. For instance, you might wrongly believe that a group of people will reject you, so you become defensive, anxious, and perhaps even hostile with them. Eventually, your behavior brings about the feared rejection, which wasn’t there to begin with. And then you, ‘the prophet,’ feels that you were right from the very beginning: “I knew they didn’t like me!” Do you see how this works? Look carefully at your own tendencies. How do your fears and beliefs about possible rejection influence your behavior toward others? Take a stand. Instead of letting fear show you what might be wrong in your relationships, start looking for signs of what might be right. All variations of fear, including the fear of rejection, thrive on “end of the world” thinking. In other words, our emotions convince us that an undesirable outcome results in annihilation. None of these things result in the “end of the world,” but if we convince ourselves that they do, we will irrationally fear these outcomes and give our fears control over us. The truth is, we – human beings – are inefficient at accurately predicting how future misfortune will make us feel. In fact, most of the time we avoid consciously thinking about it all together, which only perpetuates our subconscious fears. So ask yourself: “If disaster should strike, and my fear of being rejected comes true, what are three constructive ways I could cope and move forward with my life?” Sit down and tell yourself a story (write it down too if it helps) about how you will feel after rejection, how you will allow yourself to be upset for a short while, and then how you will begin the process of growing from the experience and moving on. Just doing this exercise will help you feel less fear around the possibility of rejection. (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” chapter of our brand NEW edition of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) If a person discovers a 200-carat white diamond in the earth but, due to ignorance, believes it to be worthless, and thus tosses it aside, does this tell us more about the diamond or the person? Along the same lines, when one person rejects another, it reveals a lot more about the ‘rejecter’ than the ‘rejected.’ All you are really seeing is the often shortsighted opinion of one person. Consider the following… If J.K. Rowling stopped after being rejected by multiple publishers for years, there would be no Harry Potter. If Howard Schultz gave up after being turned down by banks 200+ times, there would be no Starbucks. If Walt Disney quit too soon after his theme park concept was trashed by 300+ investors, there would be no Disney World. One thing is for sure: If you give too much power to the opinions of others, you will become their prisoner. So never let someone’s opinion alter your reality. Never sacrifice who you are, or who you aspire to be, just because someone else has a problem with it. Love who you are inside and out, and keep pushing forward. No one else has the power to make you feel small unless you give them that power. And when someone rejects you, don’t inevitably feel it’s because you’re unworthy or unlovable. Because, in many ways, all they’ve really done is give you feedback about their own shortsightedness. Ever noticed how people who are struggling with emotional challenges tend to tell you how they don’t want to feel? Fair enough, but at some point we all need to focus on how we DO want to feel. When you’re in a social situation that’s making you anxious, forget what you don’t want to feel for a moment. Work out how you DO want to feel right now in the present moment. Train yourself to live right here, right now without regretting how others once made you feel, or fearing the possibility of future judgment. This is YOUR choice. You CAN change the way you think. If you were delivering life-saving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on your mother in public, you’d be 100% focused and present. You wouldn’t be thinking about what bystanders thought of your hair, your body type, or the brand of jeans you were wearing. All these inconsequential details would vanish from your consciousness. The intensity of the situation would motivate you to choose not to care about what others might be thinking of you. This proves, quite simply, that thinking about what others are thinking about you is YOUR CHOICE. (Angel and I discuss this in detail in the “Relationships” chapter of our New York Times bestselling book, Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs.) The reason your fear of rejection sometimes gets the best of you is because a part of you believes you’re always right. If you think someone doesn’t like you, then surely they don’t. Right? WRONG! People who never learn to question their emotions, especially when they’re feeling worrisome or anxious, make life much more difficult than it has to be. If your perception is always so accurate, why do you make so many mistakes? Exactly! It’s time to let go a little. Being more confident in life partly means being OK with not knowing what’s going to happen, so you can relax and allow things to play out naturally. Relaxing with ‘not knowing’ is the key to confidence in relationships and peace in life. So here’s a new mantra for you – say it, and then say it again: “This is my life, my choices, my mistakes and my lessons. I have nothing to prove. And as long as I’m not hurting people, I need not worry what they think of me.” Constantly seeking approval means we’re perpetually worried that others are forming negative judgments of us. This steals the fun, ingenuity, and spontaneity from our lives. Flip the switch on this habit. If you’re lucky enough to have something that makes you different from everybody else, don’t be ashamed and don’t change. Uniqueness is priceless. In this crazy world that’s trying to make you like everyone else, find the courage to keep being your remarkable self. And if they laugh at you for being different, laugh back at them for being the same. It takes a lot of courage to stand alone, but it’s worth it. Being unapologetically YOU is worth it! Your real friends in life will reveal themselves slowly – they’re the ones who truly know you and love you just the same. Bottom line: Don’t change so people will like you; be yourself and the right people will love the real you. (Read The Mastery of Love.) As soon as someone critiques and criticizes you, as soon as you are rejected, you might find yourself thinking, “Well, that proves once again that I am not worthy.” What you need to realize is, these other people are NOT worthy of YOU and your particular journey. Rejection is necessary medicine; it teaches you how to reject relationships and opportunities that aren’t going to work, so you can quickly find new ones that will. It doesn’t mean you aren’t good enough; it just means someone else failed to notice what you have to offer. Which means you now have more time to improve yourself and explore your options. “Will you be bitter for a moment? Absolutely. Hurt? Of course, you’re human. There isn’t a soul on this planet that doesn’t feel a small fraction of their heartbreak at the awareness of rejection. For a short time afterwards you will ask yourself every question you can think of… But then you have to let your emotions fuel you! This is the important part. Let your feelings of rejection drive you, feed you, and inspire one heck of a powerful opening to the next chapter of your story. (Note: Angel and I customize and implement all of the aforementioned points with our students in the Getting Back to Happy Course & Coaching.) As you look back on your life, you will often realize that many of the times you thought you were being rejected from something good, you were in fact being redirected to something better. So just remind yourself today that you can’t control everything, especially the opinions of others. Let go a little and just let life happen the way it’s supposed to. Because oftentimes the outcomes and interactions you can’t change, end up changing you and your trajectory for the better.

"20 Uncomfortable Things You Need to Start Doing for Yourself in 2020|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/new-year-2020.jpg?resize=500%2C375&ssl=1| When you look back on 2019, don’t think of the pain you felt. Think of the strength you gained, and appreciate how far you’ve come. You’ve been through a lot in the past year, but you’ve grown a lot too. Give yourself credit for your resilience, and then step forward again with grace. The next best step forward? Start doing something uncomfortable today that will move your life forward in 2020. Let me explain… Being uncomfortable is a form of pain, but it isn’t a deep pain—it’s a shallow and necessary one. It’s that feeling you get when you’ve stepped outside of your comfort zone. The idea of exercising every morning, for example, brings discomfort—so we don’t do it. Eating green vegetables brings discomfort too. So does meditating, or focusing on a difficult task, or saying no to others. Of course, these are just examples, because all of us find discomfort in different things at different times, but you get the general idea. The bottom line is most of us don’t want to be uncomfortable, so we subconsciously run from discomfort constantly. The problem with this is that, by running from discomfort, we are forced to participate in only the (easy) activities and (unexciting) opportunities within our comfort zones. And since our comfort zones are relativity small, we miss out on most of life’s greatest and healthiest experiences, and we get stuck in an endless debilitating cycle. Are you tired of dealing with the same types of headaches and heartache over and over again? Then it’s time to break the cycle, purge some bad habits, and embrace discomfort as you prepare for the year ahead. It’s time to learn from your mistakes rather than be conquered by them, and let your errors be of commission rather than omission. Remember, you ultimately become what you repeatedly do. If your habits aren’t helping you, they’re hurting you. Which means it’s time for a change. Here are 20 uncomfortable things to start doing for yourself in the year ahead… I sincerely hope you found value in the reminders above. No doubt, they are important to think about. But right now, with 2020 literally knocking hard at the door, these reminders are even more important to act upon. And since taking action is where most of us get hung up, let me ask you a few quick questions… In the past year alone the answer to all three questions is probably dozens for most people, including myself. And obviously these questions can be slightly tweaked and applied to various areas of our lives too. The bottom line is that weakness of the mind combined with lack of action devastates our potential. When we avoid discomfort, nothing worthwhile gets done. And the only way to fix this predicament is daily practice. Your mind needs to be exercised to gain strength. It needs to be worked on a daily basis to grow. If you haven’t pushed yourself in lots of small ways over time—if you always avoid doing the uncomfortable things—you’ll almost certainly crumble on the inevitable days that are harder than you expected. (Note: Angel and I build small, uncomfortable, life-changing daily habits with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy course.) So, my challenge to you in 2020 is this: Choose to go to the gym when it would be more comfortable to sleep in. Choose to do the tenth rep when it would be more comfortable to quit at nine. Choose to create something special when it would be more comfortable to consume something mediocre. Choose to raise your hand and ask that extra question when it would be more comfortable to stay silent. Choose to stand your ground when it would be more comfortable to fit in. Just keep proving to yourself, in lots of little ways every day, that you have the guts to get in the ring and wrestle with life. And reference the list of 20 above anytime you feel like you’re slipping off track. Please leave a comment below and let us know: Which point above resonates the most with you right now?

You can never change things by holding on to the existing reality. To get ahead in life, you have to leave some things behind and build a new model for living that makes the existing model obsolete. You must make a firm decision that you’re going to make a change too. It won’t always happen naturally or automatically. Sometimes you will have to rise up against the wind and say, “I don’t care how hard this is! I don’t care how disappointed I am! I’m not going to let this get the best of me! I’m leaving this behind and moving forward with my life!” Ready? Starting today, it’s time to leave behind… Before you can truly live today a part of you has to die first. You must completely let go of what could have been, how you should have behaved and what you wish you would have done differently. You must accept the fact that you can’t change your past experiences, the opinions others once had of you, or the immediate outcomes from their choices or yours. When you embrace the present truth then you will begin to understand and feel the true power of forgiveness as it relates to others and yourself. From this new awareness you will be free to take the next best step forward. There is always a lie embedded between a promise you made to yourself and the excuses for why you haven’t followed through. To rush into explanations of any kind is always a sign of weakness. Stand strong! Life is a continuous exercise in creative problem solving. A mistake or a delay doesn’t become a failure until you refuse to correct it. Thus, most long-term failures are simply the outcomes from people who make continuous excuses instead of decisions, even though they know better. Don’t be one of them. Decide to do what you have to do, for yourself. Trust me, in a year from now, you will wish you had started today. (Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Goals and Success” chapter of the NEW edition of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) You have to admit, to a certain extent, you have spent too much of your life trying to shrink yourself. Trying to bend in half. Trying to become smaller. Quieter. Less sensitive. Less opinionated. Less YOU. Because you didn’t want to be too much or push people away. You wanted to fit in. You wanted people to like you. You wanted to make a good impression. You wanted to be wanted. So for years, you sacrificed yourself for the sake of making other people happy. And for years, you suffered. Let this be your wake-up call… The primary reason that a toxic relationship situation holds you back has little to do with what the other person does directly to you; instead, it’s about how you have to constantly shrink yourself to conform to the situation. The pain and toxicity festers when you choose to shrink. When you choose to pull back, say less, or restrain your magnificence in any way out of fear, out of logic, or out of the cleverness to survive in a relationship, this spells trouble. So it’s not about them, really, it’s about your response to them. The next opportunity you have to spend time with this person (no matter how necessary, obligatory or comfortable it may seem), ask yourself: Will I have to shrink to make this work, or is this a situation where I can grow? Call on your courage and logic when you answer this question. And give yourself some space if that’s what you need to grow. There are absolutely no guarantees when you finally come clean and practice honesty with people. Sometimes you lose what you once had. Sometimes you don’t win love and trust back. Sometimes your mistakes cut ties. Sometimes you break your own heart in the process. Sometimes you lose your footing and your way. Sometimes you end up feeling worse off than you did before. But even a step or two backward, after making a wrong turn, is a step in the right direction. You walk away from every act of honesty with a heart free from lies and regret. You have closure, one way or the other, and this helps you in the long run. Over time, you heal and find yourself living a life that’s far from the mental torture chamber you once lived in. This path to freedom and happiness is the scariest one you will ever navigate. However, it is the path that ultimately saves your life. (Read Loving What Is.) Even if it’s true that you’re growing and healing, and that it will be OK… it’s not always OK right now, and sometimes that’s all we can see and feel when we’re in the midst of a difficult life event. Sometimes NOT being OK is all we can register inside our tired minds and aching hearts. This feeling is normal. This emotion is human. The truth is, it’s not OK when someone you love is no longer living and breathing and giving their gifts to the world. It’s not OK when everything falls apart and you’re buried deep in the debris of a life you had planned for. It’s not OK when the bank accounts are nearly at zero, with no sign of a promising income opportunity. It’s not OK when someone you trust betrays you and breaks your heart. It’s not OK when you’re exhausted to the point you can’t get yourself out of bed in the morning. It’s not okay when you’re swimming in failure or shame or a grief like you’ve never known. Whatever your challenges are, sometimes it’s simply NOT OK right now. And that, above all, is more than OK. Yes, be OK with not being OK all the time. Those with the strength to succeed in the long run are the ones who lay a firm foundation of growth with the bricks that life has thrown at them. Don’t be afraid to fall apart for a little while, because when it happens, the situation will open an opportunity for you to grow and rebuild yourself into the brilliant human being you are capable of being.

Life is good. Most of us have amazing family members, friends, and other loved ones who love us back. Learn to appreciate what a gift that is. Most of us have good health, which is another gift. Most of us have eyes, with which to enjoy the amazing gifts of sunsets and nature and beauty all around us. Most of us have ears, with which to enjoy music–one of the greatest gifts of them all. We may not have all these things, because we can’t have everything, but we certainly have plenty to be grateful for. To an extent, we know this already, and yet we forget. It happens to the best of us. Sometimes Marc and I get so caught up pursuing the next big thing that we forget to pause and appreciate the things we have, and the things we’ve experienced, learned and achieved along the way. And the most tragic part of this is that our happiness takes a major hit. As human beings, when we aren’t grateful for what we have, we aren’t capable of being happy. This is not just some self-improvement cliché either. It’s been scientifically proven. For example, researchers in numerous positive psychology studies (like this one) have split study participants into two groups and instructed one group of study participants to reflect on the little things they are grateful for at the end of each day, while the other group just goes about their normal routines. Then, after several weeks, both groups are interviewed, and it becomes clear that the first group enjoyed considerably greater life satisfaction than the other group during that time period. Why does this happen? The simplest explanation is that forcing ourselves to focus on thoughts and actions related to gratitude, regardless of circumstances, helps our brains develop positive emotions. In one notable study, researchers asked participants to smile forcibly while thinking of something specific they’re grateful for. They found that this consistently stimulated mental activity associated with positive feelings and emotions. The bottom line for most of us (severe depression and other related mental illnesses notwithstanding) is pretty clear: when we force ourselves to be grateful by making gratitude a part of our daily routines, we actually feel a lot happier. In the end, the secret to being grateful is no secret. You choose to be grateful. Then you do it again and again. If you forget, begin again. There are, however, three specific gratitude strategies that Marc and I often cover with our students and coaching clients. We’ve literally seen these strategies work wonders for people over the past decade (and we practice them ourselves too). I encourage you to implement them, gradually, one at a time, into your life. And if you need further assistance, we’re here. Here’s a super simple, five-minute, evening gratitude ritual: Every evening before you go to bed, write down three things that went well during the day and their causes. Simply provide a short, causal explanation for each good thing. That’s it. We spend tens of thousands of dollars on expensive electronics, big homes, fancy cars, and lavish vacations hoping for a boost of happiness. This is a simple, free alternative, and it works. If you begin this ritual this evening, you just might be looking back on today many years from now, as the day when your whole life changed. Although gratitude comes from within, the public expression of gratitude is important too. In his best selling book, “Authentic Happiness,” the renowned positive psychologist Martin Seligman gives some practical suggestions on how to do this. He recommends that we ritualize the practice of expressing gratitude in letters to friends, family, coworkers, and other people who we interact with in our community. Marc and I have put this gratitude strategy into practice in our own lives by ritualizing it into our morning routine. We write a short email, text message, or letter each morning to one specific person, mindfully thanking and praising them for what they do that makes our lives a little brighter.  (Marc and I build mindful gratitude rituals with our students in the “Happiness and Positive Living” module of Getting Back to Happy.) It’s fairly easy to remember to be grateful for the big and obvious things that happen—a new addition to the family, a great promotion at work, a significant business breakthrough, etc. But the happiest people find ways to give thanks for the little things too. Ponder these perspective-shifting points from an article Marc wrote a while back: Be honest: when was the last time you were grateful for simply being alive, or going to sleep with a full belly? More specifically, think of all the little things you experience—the smell of a home-cooked meal, hearing your favorite song when it randomly comes on the radio, seeing a marvelous sunset, etc. Pay attention, and be grateful. Truly, the richest human isn’t the one who has the most, but the one who needs less. Wealth is a mindset. Want less and appreciate more today. And remember, the best time to focus on being grateful is when you don’t feel like it. Because that’s when doing so can make the biggest difference. (Marc and I discuss this further in the “Happiness” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) As for me, I’m wrapping up this article with a quick note of gratitude to YOU: Thank you for reading this article and other articles on www.marcandangel.com. Thank you for being a part of our community. Marc and I are truly grateful YOU are here with us. 🙂 Right now, I’d love for you to reflect on #3 above… What’s something little you’re truly grateful for, that you sometimes forget to appreciate?

The Life-Changing Magic of Doing One Thing at a Time|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/magic-doing-one-thing.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| "
"4 Ways to Find More Peace Around Difficult People|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/4-peace-difficult-people.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| How to Be Calm: One Lesson Too Many of Us Learn Too Late|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/how-to-remain-calm.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| On a chilly evening 18 years ago, after spending nearly every waking minute with Angel for eight straight days, I knew I had to tell her just one thing.  So late at night, just before she fell asleep, I whispered it in her ear.  She smiled … the kind of smile that makes me smile back.  And she said, “When I’m 75, and I think about my life and what it was like to be young, I hope I can remember this very moment.” A few seconds later she closed her eyes and fell asleep.  The room was peaceful … almost silent.  All I could hear was the soft purr of her breathing.  I stayed awake thinking about the time we’d spent together and all the choices in our lives that made this moment possible.  And at some point, I realized it didn’t matter what we’d done or where we’d gone.  Nor did the future hold any significance. All that mattered was the serenity of the moment. Just being with her, and breathing with her. . . . Why did I just share that story with you? Because doing so helps remind me. And, I know you need a reminder sometimes too. Sometimes we all need to be reminded of the beauty and sweetness of truly absorbing ourselves into the present moment—into the people, the dialogs, and the priceless little gifts that exist there. We need to be reminded of what it’s like to be truly present, and accepting, and at peace. Because too often, amidst the drama and chaos of life, we forget. We forget to simply be and breathe with those around us. We forget to appreciate the beauty they possess, despite their flaws. So, I wrote about a priceless moment from my distant past that helps me find my inner calm, no matter where I am or who I’m with.  And yes, I do realize that not every moment is a love story.  But not every moment has to be, to be good enough for us … The most fundamental aggression to ourselves and others—the most fundamental harm we can do to human nature as a whole on a daily basis—is to remain ignorant by not having the awareness or courage to look at ourselves and others honestly and gently. All day, every day, many of us get annoyed with people and their situations when they fail to live up to our expectations, as if their reality isn’t enough for us and never will be.  We reject these people and their “problems” because they somehow seem different than our own.  We feel like we need something better, something more from them—and we scream inside! We let our emotions and anxieties get the best of us.  And we blind ourselves to the truth … The truth is, when someone upsets us, this is often because they aren’t behaving according to our fantasy of how they “should” behave.  The frustration, then, stems not from their behavior but from how their behavior differs from our fantasy.  Let this sink in.  And let’s not get carried away going forward. Calmness is a human superpower! Regardless of the situation, the ultimate measure of our wisdom and strength is how calm we are when facing the situation.  The ability to not overreact or take things personally keeps our mind clear and our heart at peace, which instantly gives us the upper hand. Over the past decade, there’s a way of being Angel and I have gradually been cultivating in ourselves—we’ve been taming our tendencies to get angry and irritated with people when their behavior doesn’t match our expectations. As human beings, again, we all have an idea in our heads about how things are supposed to be, and sadly this is what often messes us up the most.  We all get frustrated when things don’t play out the way we expect them to, and people don’t behave like they’re “supposed” to.  We expect our spouses and children to act a certain way, our friends to be kind and agreeable, strangers to be less difficult, life to be easier, and so on and so forth. And when reality hits us, and everyone and everything seems to be doing the opposite of what we want, we feel pressure inside and then we overreact—anger, frustration, stress, tears, etc. So what can we do about this? Breathe … and think better. You can’t control how other people behave.  You can’t control everything that happens to you.  What you can control is how you respond to it all.  In your response is your greatest opportunity. When you feel like your lid is about to blow, take a long deep breath.  Deep breathing releases tension, calms down our fight or flight reactions, and allows us to quiet our anxious nerves so we choose more considerate and constructive responses, no matter the situation. So, for example, do your best to inhale and exhale next time another driver cuts you off in traffic.  In a recent poll we conducted with our most recent Think Better, Live Better event attendees, overreacting while fighting traffic was the most commonly cited reason for overreacting on a daily basis.  Just imagine if all the drivers on the road took deep breaths before making nasty hand gestures or screaming obscenities at others. There’s no doubt that it can drive us crazy when we don’t get what we expect from people, especially when they are being rude and difficult.  But trying to change the unchangeable, wanting others to be exactly the way we want them to be, just doesn’t work.  The alternative, though, is unthinkable to most of us: to breathe, to let go, to lead by example, and to accept people even when they irritate us. Here’s the way of being that Angel and I have been cultivating and advocating: “Being” this way—THINKING BETTER—takes practice, but it’s worth it.  It makes us less frustrated, it helps us be more mindful, it improves our relationships, it lowers our stress, and it allows us to make the world a slightly more peaceful place to be. And along these lines, watch this short video clip Angel and I created for you:  Yes, it’s your turn. To instill a little more love into this world, even when there’s no great “love story” to tell. To love the people you are with, as much as feasibly possible, until you can be with the people who truly deserve your love. Fewer outbursts. Less drama. More deep breaths, presence, and love. Ultimately, this is the way we find calmness, peace, and new opportunities in life. Let’s practice today, together.  🙂 . . .

How to Make Love Last: The Best Relationship Advice from 45 Years of Marriage|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-happy-couples.jpg?resize=500%2C339&ssl=1| On a chilly November night 18 years ago… I would have preferred not to write to you.  In fact, about a week ago, I put a post-it note on my computer monitor that said, “What would Skyman do?” (Skyman is my cat).  It was supposed to remind me not to do things that Skyman wouldn’t do. Skyman would just wag his tail or wiggle his little nose and hope that whoever he’s wagging or wiggling to understands that he’s hungry, or lonely, or in love, or whatever.  But he certainly wouldn’t write a silly love letter to the coolest girl he knows.  Because he can’t form complex thoughts.  And because he’s smart enough not to be so stupid. This evening, the post-it note fell off my computer monitor and landed on the floor.  And although post-it notes usually lose their stick after a few days, this one was different.  It was still really sticky and shouldn’t have come unstuck.  And it was light green, which is the color of your eyes.  These were obvious signs I couldn’t ignore. So, I decided to write to you…  To tell you that Hanging by a Moment is a totally awesome song.  That Diet Coke tastes better when you smile.  And that the world seems slightly easier to understand today than it did yesterday. But still not as easy to understand as two days ago, when a friend and I shared a three-scoop 5 & Diner ice cream sundae at midnight.  And decided that some people are like hot fudge and others are like hard candy.  And I don’t remember why we decided that. But it had something to do with friendship.  And ice cream with two spoons instead of one.  And later that night, after I dropped you off, I wanted to call you to ask whether you preferred hard candy or hot fudge, just to find out whether you’d sigh and giggle simultaneously when I’d ask.  Because that’s what I think you’d do. I didn’t call you because Skyman wouldn’t do that.  He wouldn’t even know how to dial your phone number.  Because a cat’s paws are not nearly as dexterous as human hands.  Which must be nice for Skyman, because love is a lot simpler when you have paws. Anyway, it’s midnight again.  And I’m sitting up in bed with my laptop thinking about how our lives begin and end in the time it takes the universe to blink.  Which isn’t too long.  But long enough for letters that aren’t too long.  Letters that ramble instead of saying what they want to say.  Which is… I wish you were here.  Just breathing beside me. . . . When Angel and I were first falling in love—as depicted in the story above—I went to my parent’s house one evening for some much-needed relationship advice.  It just so happened to be my mom and dad’s 27th wedding anniversary the following day, so both of them were eager to reflect on what they had learned from each other and their relationship over the years.  The advice they gave me that evening was truly wise, but even more important was the family ritual born that day.  Every year since—now eighteen years and counting—I’ve pestered my parents (they love it) on their wedding anniversary and asked them for a new relationship tip or two, and I’ve recorded their advice in my journal. Today, as we near my parent’s 45th wedding anniversary (and as Angel and I continue to celebrate 18 years together), I want to share a cleaned-up, copy-edited version of some of the best relationship advice my mom and dad have dispensed over the years.  Perhaps you will find as much value in their wisdom as Angel and I have… If your happiness is dependent on the constant validation and approval of your partner, then you are giving away far too much of your power.  It’s human nature to want to be loved and admired, to want to be included, but it’s damaging to your self-esteem and emotional strength if it’s something you have to constantly beg for. The key is to nurture your own inner strength, then bring it into your relationship. Think of your relationship as a home you live in.  Whether you like your home or not doesn’t depend on how the furniture is arranged—it’s how you arrange your mind.  You have to decide to love yourself in it, and then radiate this inner love outward. All the love and validation you need is yours to give yourself.  So the next time you feel pressured to be a people-pleaser, try taking a deep breath and reminding yourself that you don’t owe anyone your constant justification—not even your partner.  Revel in the reality that you get to choose.  You have the authority to decide how to spend your time and energy.  And here’s the real beauty of it: when you don’t owe anyone anything—when you’re self-reliant—you’re free to give and receive love from the heart, without baggage. Come from this place of wholeness, of inner strength and independence, and then love your partner.  Not because you need them to love you back, not because you’re desperate to be needed, but because loving them is a miraculous thing to do. Above all, acceptance means two people agree to disagree with each other on some things, and they’re perfectly okay with it.  Differences of opinion, even major ones, don’t destroy relationships—it’s how people in a relationship deal with their inevitable differences that counts. Some couples waste years trying to change each other’s minds, but this can’t always be done, because many of their disagreements are rooted in fundamental differences in how they see the world and themselves.  By fighting over these deep-seated differences, all they succeed in doing is wasting their time and running their relationship into the ground. So how do truly loving couples cope with disagreements that can’t be resolved?  They accept one another as is—they understand that problems are an inevitable part of any long-term relationship, in the same way chronic physical difficulties are inevitable as we grow older and wiser.  These problems are like a weak knee or a bad back—we may not want these problems, but we’re able to cope with them, to avoid situations that irritate them, and to develop strategies that help us ease the pain.  When choosing a long-term partner, you will inevitably be choosing a particular set of unsolvable problems that you’ll be grappling with for the next 10, 20 or 50 years.  And in many ways, that’s a truly beautiful thing. So just remember that the foundation of love is to let those we care about be unapologetically themselves, and not distort them to fit our own egotistical ideas of who they should be.  And no, you won’t always see things eye to eye, and that’s OK.  Sometimes you just need to choose to be wrong, not because we really are wrong, but because you value your relationship more than your pride. Your partner is not a mind reader.  Share your thoughts openly.  Give them the information they need rather than expecting them to know it all.  The more that remains unspoken, the greater the risk for problems.  Start communicating clearly.  Don’t try to read their mind, and don’t make them try to read yours.  Most problems, big and small, within a relationship start with broken communication. Also, don’t listen so you can reply—listen to understand.  Open your ears and mind to your partner’s concerns and opinions without judgment.  Look at things from their perspective as well as your own.  Try to put yourself in their shoes.  Even if you don’t understand exactly where they’re coming from, you can still respect them.  You can still put your phone away, turn your body toward them, and look them squarely in the eyes.  Doing so demonstrates that you actually want to communicate and hear what they have to say.  This reinforces the sort of supportive environment that’s crucial for the growth of love and respect in any relationship. When disagreements in a relationship arise, the easiest thing to do is to run away, especially if you’re not a confrontational person by nature.  But you have to catch yourself, because this isn’t just about you and whether or not you feel like dealing with your differences.  It’s about what your relationship needs in order to grow and thrive in the long run.  You have to put your relationship’s needs ahead of your own sometimes.  Both people must be committed to dealing with disagreements openly, because running from them will only make matters more difficult to deal with down the road. On the flipside of running away, you also have to be mindful of how easily a disagreement can snowball into global attacks on your partner, and not on their decisions or behavior.  For example: “They didn’t call me when they said they would because they forgot, but because they’re a horrible, wretched, evil person.”  The difference is easy to discern, right?  So, let’s take a deep breath when we need one, so we can deal with the reality we’re actually facing. One of the most simple and effective tools people in relationships can use to ease the process of dealing with disagreements is using positive language.  Relationships flourish when two people are able to share their innermost feelings and thoughts in a positive way.  An effective method of doing this during a disagreement is to do your best to avoid using the word “you” and try to use the word “I” instead.  This makes it much easier to express your true feelings while avoiding the possibility of verbally attacking the other person.  So instead of saying, “You are wrong,” try saying, “I don’t understand.”  Instead of telling them, “You always . . .” try saying, “I often feel . . .”  It’s a subtle shift that can make a big difference. My grandmother once told me, “When someone you love backs themselves into a corner, look the other way until they get themselves out, and then act as though it never happened.”  Allowing someone to save face in this way, and not reminding them of what they already know is not their most intelligent behavior, is an act of great kindness.  This is possible when you realize that people typically behave in such ways because they are suffering momentarily.  They react to their own thoughts and feelings, and their behavior often has nothing to do with you. We all have unreasonable mood swings sometimes.  We all have bad days.  Giving your partner the space to save face, and not taking things personally when they’re occasionally upset, cranky, or having a bad day, is a priceless gift.  Even if you are unquestionably right and they are unquestionably wrong, when emotions are flying high and you force them to lose face, you’re simply bruising their heart and ego.  You’re accomplishing nothing but diminishing their worth in their own eyes. So just do your best to let them preserve their dignity when it makes sense.  Give them space, let the emotions settle, and then have a rational conversation using the positive communication tactics discussed in the previous point. You know how to tell if something is alive and well?  You look for evidence of growth. Healthy lifelong relationships contain two people who are committed to lifelong learning and growth.  They’re curious about things.  They’re keen to learn from the world and from each other.  And because of their love for learning, they afford each other the freedom to develop as individuals within the relationship. Throughout a decade of coaching our students and our Think Better, Live Better conference attendees, we have seen many unhappy relationships that were caused primarily by one or both people being stubbornly clingy.  In a nutshell, these “stubbornly clingy” people didn’t want their friends or partners to change.  But here’s the simple truth: change is a part of the universe, and human beings are no exception.  If you want to have a successful relationship, you’ve got to embrace personal growth with open arms, and all the changes that come with it. This final point encompasses the previous six, and then some.  In a healthy long-term relationship, two people love each other more than they need each other.  Because of this, the relationship itself becomes a safe haven to practice love.  And love, ultimately, is a practice—a daily rehearsal of honesty, presence, communication, acceptance, forgiveness, and heartfelt patience. Sadly, too often we forget the practicing part and we default instead to treating love like it’s a guaranteed destination we can jump to whenever we have time.  We want to arrive at that “perfect” loving feeling in a relationship without putting in the work.  And when it doesn’t work out that way, we assume the relationship itself is broken.  But this is missing the whole point of a relationship—and the whole point of love. Again, love is a practice.  It’s showing up for all the unexpected and inconvenient moments of a relationship, taking a deep breath, and asking yourself, “What part of love needs to be practiced here?”  The answer will vary from one encounter to the next, in a continuous stream of tenderness, affection, and wisdom you could never have dreamed of or perfectly planned for upfront. Angel and I have been together for nearly two decades now—we’ve been through a lot together—and we love each other more and more with each passing day.  And, I am convinced the relationship advice above is the reason why.  It’s some of the best and most practical, hard-won relationship advice there is to tell. Talk to any set of grandparents—like my parents—whose relationship has withstood the tests of time, and they will tell you that the best relationships are not just about the good times you share, they’re also about the obstacles you go through together, the disagreements you compromise on, and the fact that you still say “I love you” in the end.  And loving someone isn’t just about saying it every day, it’s about showing it every day through actions and behaviors, even when you and your partner aren’t seeing things eye to eye. It all makes sense to me now.  I’ve come a long way since that night I was asking myself, “What would Skyman do?”  😉 Cheers to growth! Cheers to my parents! And cheers to making true love last a lifetime! . . . And, if you’re feeling up to it, I’d love to know what you think of this essay. What resonated? What’s on your mind right now?

Teamwork: How Small People Create Massive, Life-Changing Results|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/small-people-life-changing.jpg?resize=500%2C341&ssl=1| This morning, as I was relaxing at the water’s edge of Miami Beach, I couldn’t help but eavesdrop on a conversation four teenage kids were having on the beach blankets next to me.  They were talking about making a positive difference in the world.  And it went something like this… “It’s impossible to make a difference unless you’re a huge corporation or someone with lots of money and power,” one of them said. “Yeah man,” another replied.  “My mom keeps telling me to move mountains—to speak up and stand up for what I believe.  But what I say and do doesn’t even get noticed.  I just keep answering to ‘the man’ and then I get slapped back in place by him whenever I step out of line.” “Repression…” another snickered. I smiled because I know exactly how they feel.  When I was their age, I was certain I was being repressed and couldn’t possibly make a difference in the world.  And I actually almost got suspended from school once after I openly expressed how repressed I felt in the middle of the principal’s office. Eventually, one of the kids noticed me eavesdropping and smiling.  He sat up, looked at me and said, “What?  Do you disagree?”  As he waited for a response, the other three kids turned around too. Rather than arguing with them, I stood up, took an old receipt out of my wallet, ripped it into four pieces, and wrote a different word on each piece.  Then I crumbled the pieces into little paper balls and handed a different piece to each one of them.  The kids looked noticeably confused. “Look at the word written on the paper I just handed you and don’t show it to anyone else.”  The kids followed my instructions and then glared back up at me.  “You have two choices,” I told them.  “If your word inspired you to make a difference in this world, then hold onto it.  If not, give it back to me so I can recycle the paper.”  They all returned their words without hesitation. I sat down on the sand next to the kids’ beach blankets and carefully laid out the four words they had just returned to me, so they could clearly see me combine the words one at a time to create a simple sentence: “I have a dream.” “Dude, that’s Martin Luther King Jr.,” one of the kids said. “How did you know that?” I asked. “Everyone knows Martin Luther King Jr.” the kid snarled.  “He has his own national holiday, and we all had to memorize his speech in school last year.” “Why do you think your teachers had you memorize his speech?” I asked “I don’t really care!” the kid replied.  His three friends shook their heads in agreement.  “What does this have to do with us and our situation?” “Your teachers asked you to memorize those words, just like thousands of teachers around the world have asked students to memorize those words, because they have inspired millions of people, repressed or otherwise, to dream of a better world and take action to make their dreams come true.  Do you see where I’m going with this?” “Man, I know exactly what you’re trying to do and it’s not going to work, alright?” the fourth kid said, who hadn’t spoken a word until now.  “We’re not going to get all inspired and emotional about something some dude said fifty years ago.  Our world is different now.  And it’s more screwed up than any us can even begin to imagine, and there’s little you or I can do about it.  We’re too small, we’re nobodies!” I smiled again because I once believed and used to say similar things.  Then, after holding the smile for a few seconds, I said, “On their own, ‘I’ or ‘have’ or ‘a’ or ‘dream’ are just words.  Not very compelling or inspiring.  But when you put them together in a certain order, they create a phrase that has been powerful enough to move millions of people to take positive action—action that changed laws, perceptions, and lives.  You don’t need to be inspired or emotional to agree with this, do you?” The four kids just shrugged, but they struggled to appear totally indifferent, so I could tell they were listening intently.  “And what’s true for words is also true for people,” I continued.  “One person without help from anyone else can’t do much to make a sizable difference in this crazy world—or to overcome all of the various forms of repression that exist today.  But when people get together and unite to form something more powerful and meaningful than themselves, the possibilities are endless. Together is how mountains are moved.  Together is how small people create massive, life-changing results.” About an hour after I spoke to those four teenage kids this morning, I grabbed coffee with an old friend, Megan, who has spent the past two decades of her life driving teams of horses that pull carriages for “romantic rides” through downtown Orlando.  In conversation, I told her about the kids and what I had discussed with them.  She listened curiously and then responded with some incredibly interesting insight.  Our conversation went something like this… “I love your message of teamwork to those kids,” Megan said.  “It actually reminds me of working with my horses.” “What do you mean?” I asked with a smirk. “Well, something you might not know is that two horses pulling together can pull significantly more than the sum of the same two horses pulling separately.” “That’s interesting…” Megan continued, “One single draft horse can pull roughly 8,000 pounds.  But when you harness two draft horses on the same load, they don’t just pull twice their maximum load, they can actually pull three times their maximum load, which is roughly 24,000 pounds.” “So, the sum of the two horses working together actually multiplies each horse’s individual payload power?” I asked. “Exactly,” Megan said. “That’s amazing, but how can this ‘extra power’ be explained?” “Well, in basic scientific terms I suppose you could say it’s easier to keep a body in motion rather than to accelerate a motionless body from rest.  The main reason behind this is that lesser force—one horse pulling by itself—means more allowance for friction.  Thus, moving a heavy object beyond a high-friction point, to the point where it has momentum, is a lot harder than simply keeping the same heavy object moving once it has momentum.  Two horses working together means less friction and more momentum, which ultimately equates to a higher payload power.” “That makes complete sense,” I said.  “You’re bringing me back to my college physics classes.  But, I also wonder if there’s a psychological aspect in play for the horses.  For example, is it possible that the horses are also more motivated when they get an opportunity to work together, rather than alone?” Megan paused for a moment and cracked a half-smile.  “I’d say your hunch is correct, Marc.  Horses are truly pack animals with an active herd instinct.  This can manifest itself in a group of horses showing an obvious willingness to do things together for a human being, that they would otherwise hesitate to do by themselves.  In essence, you might be able to get a pair of draft horses to attempt to pull a higher gross weight each than you could to convince them to pull alone.  A team of horses is incredibly strong and it truly is a magnificent feat to witness when they are pulling a carriage full of people all over town.  It’s teamwork at its finest!  And, I think, there’s an obvious lesson here for all of us.” Why did I just share these stories with you? Because doing so helps remind me. And, I know you need a reminder sometimes too. Sometimes we all need to be reminded of the power and beauty of working together. As Helen Keller so profoundly said, “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.”  There is immense power between us when we combine forces to work toward a common goal.  Teamwork is everything! All together… we are infinite! . . . If you’re feeling up to it, I’d love to know what you think of this essay. What resonated? What’s on your mind right now?

Here’s what you should ask yourself first.|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/should-i-forgive-him.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.– Albert Einstein She showed up at my front door before work at 7am this morning with the most troubled, despondent expression on her face (which is not typical of her disposition).  “I’m sorry I didn’t call,” she said.  “But I haven’t slept all night, and I really need to talk to someone.  I just need some advice.” I invited her in and poured her a cup of coffee.  “So, what’s on your mind?” I asked. “Last night my husband told me something about his college years that he never told me before,” she said in a shaky voice.  “And I completely disagree with his actions.  It’s horrible, really… and I just can’t stop thinking about it!  I don’t know if I will ever be able to forgive him.” “Well, before you tell me anything else, let me ask you this: Why do you think your husband confided in you?  I mean, why do you think he told you, now?” “I don’t know,” she replied.  “I guess he finally trusted me enough to tell me.” “Did he commit a crime?”  I asked. “No.” “Was anyone physically or emotionally hurt by his actions?” “No, not really.” “So, how do you feel about him right now?  Do you still love him?” “Of course I do,” she replied. “And whatever he did back in college, do you think he learned his lesson?  Or do you think he would do it again?” “Oh, I’m fairly certain he learned a big lesson,” she replied.  “He actually teared up about it when he told me—he said he’s still ashamed of himself.” “Okay, so let me get this straight then… Last night your husband finally felt that he trusted you enough to tell you about a dark secret from his college years.  And although somewhat unsettling, he didn’t hurt anyone, and you think he learned his lesson, which means he grew emotionally from the experience.  And to top it off, you’re still completely in love with him.  So, what exactly can you never forgive him for?” She sat in silence for a few seconds, made a crooked half smile, and then shook her head.  I mimicked her facial expressions and shook my head back at her. Then she started laughing.  And so did I. Sometimes the problems we have with others—our spouse, parents, siblings, etc.—don’t really have much to do with them at all, because these problems are actually about us. And that’s okay.  It simply means these little predicaments will be easier to solve.   We are, after all, in charge of our own decisions.  We get to decide whether we want to keep our head cluttered with events from the past, or instead open our minds to the positive realities unfolding in front of us. All we need is the willingness to look at things a little differently—letting go of “what happened” and “what should never have been,” and instead focusing our energy on “what is” and “what could be possible.” Because, as my friend discovered this morning, sometimes the only problem standing in our way is the one we created in our head. That’s a question I challenge you to ask yourself first, whenever you feel like my friend felt when she arrived at my doorstep this morning.  It’s a simple question that can provide a necessary dose of perspective when your emotions are surging.  And, it’s a practice Marc and I often discuss with our course students and live event attendees when forgiveness is at stake in their personal relationships. The bottom line is that letting go of the need to forgive every misstep and mistake a person makes can be mentally and emotionally freeing for everyone involved. Truly, there is an obvious shift in our hearts and minds that happens when we go from feeling hurt and upset to peaceful and loving, but it’s not necessarily forgiveness that’s taking place, it’s just the realization that there was nothing to forgive in the first place.  Because mistakes are the growing pains of wisdom, and sometimes they just need to be accepted with no strings attached. To help you wrap your head around this concept, try to look at your situation from a distance.  Imagine a more seasoned, wiser and more compassionate version of yourself sitting at the mountaintop of life, looking down and watching as the younger-minded, present version of you stumbles your way through life. You see yourself holding on to false beliefs and making obvious errors of judgment as you maneuver through life’s many obstacles.  You watch the children of the world growing up in challenging times that test their sense of self-confidence, yet they push forward bravely.  You see the coming generation radiating with passion and love as they fail forward, learning through their mistakes. And you have to wonder:  Would this wiser version of yourself conclude that almost everyone in their own unique way was doing their very best?  And if everyone is trying to do their best, what really needs to be forgiven?  Not being perfect? Obviously, there is NOT a one-size-fits-all answer to anything in life, and forgiveness is no exception.  Some situations are far more complicated than others.  But in any case, let’s do our best to challenge our minds with a necessary dose of perspective whenever our emotions are surging.  Let’s learn from our mistakes, and let others learn from theirs.  Let’s embrace our imperfections, and let others embrace theirs… And, let’s begin again, together, with a little more acceptance, compassion, and peace of mind. As I’m wrapping up this short essay, I’m reminded of a quote Marc wrote in our New York Times bestselling book: “Forgive yourself for the bad decisions you made, for the times you lacked understanding, for the choices that hurt others and yourself.  Forgive yourself, for being young and reckless.  These are all vital lessons.  And what matters most right now is your willingness to grow from them.” Don’t you just love that compassionate sentiment?  I sincerely wish such compassion for myself and for everyone else. . . .

"5 Signs You’ve Been Doing Too Much for Too Long|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/5-signs-doing-too-much.jpg?resize=500%2C331&ssl=1| When things aren’t adding up in your life, begin subtracting. Busyness is an illness. Think about your own life and the lives of those close to you. Most of us have a tendency to do as much as we possibly can—cramming every waking minute with events, extravagances, tasks and obligations. We think doing more will get us more satisfaction, success, etc. When oftentimes the exact opposite is true. Less can be far more rewarding in the long run. But we’re so set in our ways that we can’t see this. And so… How can we tame our urge to do too much? Simply focus more on doing less every step of the way. Be mindful of the urge to over-do it. It’s taken me awhile to get the hang of it, but I’m getting there… Anyway, I hope you will join me on this journey. Let’s do a little less… and make the less we do count for even more. Here are five signs now is the right time to do just that: I want to leave you with two quotes from our friend Joshua Becker’s book, The More of Less, because I just re-read it and absolutely love how his sentiment coincidentally compliments this blog post: Cheers to making life simple again! 🙂 In what way do you need to start doing less?

A 2-Minute Morning Routine that Guarantees a Great Start to the Day|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/2-minute-morning-routine.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| 7 Powerful Reminders to Focus on What Matters|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-get-your-priorities-straight.jpg?resize=500%2C334&ssl=1| 4 Steps to Loving Your Ordinary Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/5-worst-parts-of-yourself.jpg?resize=500%2C406&ssl=1| Let’s start with the bitter truth: You will never be as good as you think you should be. And life will never be as easy as you expected. All of us are faced with the same reality. There will inevitably be times when we slip up and fail to meet our (unreasonable) expectations of ourselves. It’ll likely happen quite often too. And if we don’t embrace these slip-ups and failures as necessary lessons learned, we will gradually and unknowingly become self-conscious about everything we’re not doing and achieving according to planned. Honestly, it happens every day to the best of us—we hopelessly catch ourselves thinking about how we’re falling short. We worry that we haven’t made as much progress as we thought we would. We worry that we’ll never be as productive as we could be. And our worrying just leads to more senseless worrying. We worry that we don’t… We worry that we should be doing… And so, we’re left feeling guilty that we’re not as good as we should be—that we’re not doing the perfect thing at the perfect time, ever. The good news is that thoughts like these are natural, because the human mind isn’t perfect—it worries about things. But we can learn to catch and control these thoughts, so they don’t catch and control us. To an extent, we all have this lavish idea in our heads about how our lives are supposed to be. We fantasize that we should be living a different and better life… And through it all we’re supposed to be smiling too, right? Wrong! That’s not how life really works. At least not 24/7. The truth is, we are miraculously flawed human beings living miraculously flawed lives. And the “miraculous” part only transpires when we accept and make the best of what we have. Close your eyes and reflect on the present reality of your life, and whisper, “I am OK. Life is OK. I will let my present life situation be what it is, instead of what I think it should be, and I will make the best of it.” The key is to accept the fact that there’s no such thing as a perfect life. There’s no perfect thing you should have already accomplished, and no perfect sequence of things you should be accomplishing right now. There’s just this moment you’re living through and what you choose to do with it. And yes, disappointment with this moment, with yourself, and with others is often part of the picture—there’s no escaping this reality. But what will you choose to do… You can be disappointed in this moment and do nothing, or you can practice being satisfied with the opportunity to make the very best of it. When Angel and I guide our course students through the process of letting go of their “perfect life” or “perfect self” fantasies, we cover a four-step practice for doing so. It’s a simple series of steps that can work wonders at any given moment in time, but it takes some diligence (it’s not necessarily convenient or easy): Again, this is a practice—a life-changing daily ritual—and it’s not something any of us will ever be “perfect” at. We just remind ourselves often, and when we forget we remind ourselves again, and we begin again with our practice. One day at a time. (Angel and I build life-changing daily rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy Course.) Oh, and this short article, by the way, is as much a reminder to Angel and me as it is a guide for you or anybody else who might find value in it. We’re all in this one together. May this moment be as good as we collectively choose to make it. As I wrap up here, I’m reminded of something Angel and I have learned the hard way from the most heart wrenching moments of our lives—losing loved ones early and unexpectedly: Death is an unpredictable inevitability. Embracing this fact provides a renewed sense of awareness, to realize that we’ve lived a certain number of days, and the days ahead of us are not as guaranteed as the one we’re living through right now. When I think of this I am reminded that every day truly is an opportunity to be grateful for, not in a clichéd kind of way, but to honestly appreciate what we have here, and to admit that we alone are responsible for the quality of our present lives. This makes our self-respect and positive focus evermore important, right here, right now. It leaves no time to wallow in self-pity and self-doubt. The last thing any of us wants to do is die with regret, hence why respecting the reality of death puts life into perspective. It humbles us and should also deeply motivate us to lead our lives and make the best of it… Less criticizing and complaining. More acceptance, appreciation and enjoyment of this blessed yet often ordinary life. Love where you are right now. You’ve come a long way, and you’re still learning and growing. Be thankful for the lessons. Take them and make the best of things right now. Before you go we would love to hear from YOU. How has the pressure coming from peers, family, work, and society in general affected your perception of life? All of us deal with this pressure, and if we don’t have the “right” job, relationship, lifestyle, and so forth, by a certain age or time frame, we start believing we’re not as good as we “should” be, and we quietly scold ourselves behind closed doors for not living more glamorous lives. Angel and I hear about this kind of self-defeating mindset from our course students on a daily basis, and we aren’t immune either. The four-step practice discussed in this post will undoubtedly help, but we’d love to hear about your firsthand experience with this phenomenon. How have you coped? Please leave a reply below. 5 Hard Questions that Can Save a Life (and Spare Some Pain)|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/5-hard-questions-pain.jpg?resize=500%2C332&ssl=1| We waste our lives waiting for ideal paths to appear in front of us. But they never do. Because we forget that paths are made by walking, not waiting. There’s nothing more disheartening than a perfectly healthy, reasonably affluent human being with the whole world in her hands who’s chronically unhappy and unproductive. There’s really no excuse for it either, yet Marc and I see this phenomenon unfolding every single day—people who choose to be stuck in misery and refuse to admit it. This mindset often results from an extremely unbalanced life—one with too much expectation and not enough discipline and appreciation. The bottom line is that when you have very little discipline for accomplishing new things, and very little gratitude for what you already have, you’ll never know the true joy of making progress in life, because nothing will ever change, and even when it does, it will never be good enough in your mind. So, how do you cultivate balance in life when everything is already so far out of whack? For a decade now, Marc and I have had the privilege of coaching hundreds of people from every walk of life, with various socioeconomic backgrounds, from dozens of countries around the world, including some extremely powerful and successful businesswomen and businessmen. Many of the happiest and most successful among them habitually uphold five key principles that dictate both the effectiveness of their daily decisions and the quality of their lives. Today, I’ve turned these five key principles into five hard questions for you—hard, because following through with what they ask of you is far from easy. If you avoid these questions and make decisions unconsciously, there’s a good chance you’ll end up like the majority of people who tend to be out of shape physically, exhausted mentally, and personally and professionally regretful. But, if you ask yourself these questions on a regular basis, and make your daily decisions consciously, you can literally save yourself from a life filled with needless pain and frustration… At every moment, millions of little things compete for your attention. All these things fall into one of two categories: things that are important and things that are not. People never get more done by blindly working more hours on everything that comes up. Instead, they get more done when they follow careful plans that measure and track key priorities and milestones. So if you want to be more successful and less stressed, don’t ask how to make something more efficient until you’ve first asked, “Do I need to do this at all?” Simply being able to do something well does not make it the right thing to do. I think this is one of the most common problems with a lot of time-management advice; too often productivity gurus focus on how to do things quickly, but the vast majority of things people do quickly should not be done at all. (Read Getting Things Done.) Where your mind goes, energy flows. Which area of your life do you tend to focus on: what you have or what’s missing from your life? I’m sure you think about both sides of this equation. But if you scrutinize your habitual thoughts, what do you tend to spend more time dwelling on? The positives or the negatives? Rather than focusing on what you don’t have and begrudging those who are better off than you, perhaps you should acknowledge that you have lots to be grateful for. Developing a habit of appreciating what you have can create a new level of emotional well-being and strength. But the real question is: do you take time to feel deeply grateful with your mind, body, heart and soul? That’s where the energy to take positive action comes from. So don’t let negativity and drama get the best of you. Your brain is a radio transmitter. It broadcasts thoughts, directions and vibrations into your life—you get to choose the station it’s tuned to. Happy, successful people understand this and tune out negativity to make room for positivity. Be wise enough to follow in their footsteps. Walk away from the nonsense around you. Focus on the positives, and soon the negatives will be harder to see. Also, along these same lines, accept the fact that there’s a lot you can’t control. And if you focus on what you can’t control, you’ll do nothing but create more stress for yourself. So remember, you can influence many aspects of your life but you can’t control them entirely. Once you fully accept and adopt this pattern of thinking, another important question must be asked: Even when we’re being positive, we all have challenges; there’s no escaping that. But how you feel about your life has little to do with the events in it or what has (or hasn’t) happened to you. The meaning you assign to these things controls the quality of your life. Most of the time, however, you may be unaware of the effect of your unconscious mind in assigning meaning to life’s events. So check-in with yourself… Bottom line: When something negative happens, view this circumstance as a chance to learn something you didn’t know. Don’t wish it never happened. Don’t try to step back in time. Take the lessons learned and step forward. You have to tell yourself, “It’s OK. I’m doing OK.” You need to know that it’s better to cross new lines and suffer the consequences of a lesson learned from time to time, than to just stare at the lines for the rest of your life and always wonder. Also keep in mind that the past, even when troubled, is invaluable to your present. It provides a solid foundation for everything you’re doing now. Learn from it—the mistakes and the successes—and then let it go. This process might seem easier said than done, but it depends on your focus. The past is just training; it doesn’t define you in this moment. Think about what went wrong, but only in terms of how it will help you make things right. When we shift our habitual focus and meanings, there’s no limit on what life can become. A change of focus and a shift in meaning can literally alter our biochemistry and the trajectory of our lives in a couple minutes flat. So take control and always remember: Meaning equals emotion and emotion equals power. Choose wisely. Find an empowering meaning in any event, and best will always be yours for the taking. And that leads right in to the next question… While everyone else is talking about it, successful people are quietly doing it. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: It doesn’t matter if you have a genius IQ and a PhD in Quantum Physics, you can’t change anything or make any sort of real-world progress without taking action. There’s a huge difference between knowing how to do something and actually doing it. Knowledge and intelligence are both useless without action. It’s as simple as that. Successful people know that a good plan executed today is better than a perfect plan executed someday. They don’t wait for the “right time” or the “right day” or the “right (impossible) circumstances”, because they know these reactions are based on a fear and nothing more. They take action here and now, today—because that’s where real progress happens. (Marc and I discuss this in detail in the “Goals and Success” chapter of the NEW edition of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) You want to lose weight, but when you’re tired, it’s easy to rationalize that you’ll start exercising and eating right tomorrow. You want to build a more profitable business, but when you’re caught up in the daily grind, it’s easy to just do what’s familiar instead of what’s required for growth. You want to nurture your closest relationships, but when you’re busy, it’s easy to rationalize that you really need to work on that client proposal instead. Few good things come easy, and when the going gets tough we often take the easy way out—even though the easy way takes us the wrong way. To combat this, many of the happiest and most successful people we know create tangible reminders that pull them back from the brink of their weak impulses. A friend of ours who has paid off almost $100K of debt in the past five years has a copy of his credit card balance taped to his computer monitor; it serves as a constant reminder of the debt he wants to pay off. Another friend keeps a photo of herself when she was 90 pounds heavier on her refrigerator as a reminder of the person she never wants to be again. And another fills his desk with family photos, both because he loves looking at them and because, when work gets really tough, these photos remind him of the people he is ultimately working for. Think of moments when you are most likely to give in to impulses that take you farther away from your ultimate goals. Then use tangible reminders of those goals to interrupt the impulse and keep you on track. Now that you’re aware of the power of these five questions and their subsequent decisions, start looking for role models who are experiencing what you want out of life. When we observe someone we want to learn from and we have a crystal clear idea of what we want to create for ourselves, it unlocks a tremendous amount of motivation. Human beings are socially inclined, and when we get the idea that we want to join some elite circle up above us, that is what really motivates us to reach our potential. “Look, they did it. I can do it too!” And yes, you CAN do it too! It may sound overly simplistic, but when you spend enough time asking yourself the right questions and studying people who have been where you want to go, you’ll gradually clear a pathway to create the positive changes you desire in life. Remember that you ultimately become what you repeatedly do. The acquisition of knowledge—everything you just read—doesn’t mean you’re growing. Growing happens only when what you know changes how you live on a daily basis. Most people miss the second part. Don’t be one of them today.

"3 Ways to Break Through When You’re Burning Out and Ready for a Change|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/3-ways-burning-out.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| In the midst of particularly hard days when I feel that I can’t endure, I remind myself that my track record for getting through hard days is 100% so far. On my birthday many moons ago, when Google and I were both a lot younger, I Googled “how to change your life when you’re burning out” to see what would come up. I had been feeling hopelessly trapped in a cycle of busyness—like I was racing around in circles every day without any meaningful progress. And it was time to find a better roadmap because I was literally getting depressed with the same old grind. Granted, I was working 60+ hours a week, struggling with a failing business, and coping with the recent deaths of two loved ones. The stress and pace of life just seemed to keep me busy from sunrise to midnight every day without much time for self-reflection or mindfulness, and deep down I knew the head-spinning, circular path I was on wasn’t sustainable. As I scrolled through Google’s search results I was fascinated by the overwhelming quantity of books, articles and quotes all designed to motivate a person to take positive action and make positive changes. Messages of “Let Go and Move On” or “Be Present” were plentiful! However, nothing truly clicked with me. I was looking for guidance that was a bit more specific—guidance like “Walk seven blocks down Main Street and turn right onto Sunshine Drive. Your ‘better’ path begins there.” I continued to read and look for a new set of directions I could follow, and then it hit me. My losses and personal turmoil had me running and hiding from my problems. I was doing an incredible job being incredibly busy, but I had never stopped to sort out my thoughts and figure out exactly why I was doing what I was doing. My need to provide for my family and ease the pain endured from failure and loss fueled my mindlessness. I was using these circumstances as excuses for not sorting out my priorities, and thus I got stuck in a cycle of futile busyness that was burning me out. I recognized that in order to truly move my life forward, I first had to step on the brakes. I had to give myself the time and space to sort things out. When I did pause, I began to think of the summer after my high school graduation. My thoughts time-traveled back to those days when I felt like possibilities awaited me in every imaginable direction. I had been accepted to a great university, I was young and ambitious, and I was ready to conquer my dreams. But remembering this didn’t make me feel better. In fact, over a decade later, trying to look at the world through this youthful lens for more than a few minutes only made me feel more restless. Maybe it’s the life lessons I was forced to learn the hard way, or the toll of pain and failure, but I had to admit to myself right then and there that the youthful world of possibility felt a whole lot scarier and riskier this time around. I wanted to be passionate and productive again, but I didn’t know how, until my wise mom gave me some good advice. She told me that she could still see the positive, passionate young man inside of me, but that I needed to do some soul searching to reconnect myself to him. As I attempted to follow my mom’s advice, I remembered that I used to have two quotes written on post-it notes hanging on my bedroom wall when I was a kid: So, I wrote the two quotes down again just as I remembered them, and posted them up on the wall over my nightstand. I woke up to these quotes every morning for several years thereafter, and they helped keep me centered. I also took tiny steps, day in and day out, until I knew I was finally moving down the right path again. For anybody else who feels burnt out and without a real sense of how to take the next step forward, I offer the following ideas. They are simple, actionable lessons that kept me moving forward when I decided it was time for a change. Perhaps they will help you, too… You can post meaningful quotes on your bedroom wall, or find a coffee a mug that has a motivational message on it (mine says “Every Day is an Opportunity”). But you can also take it a step further than that too… Few good things come easy, and when the going gets tough we often take the easy way out even though the easy way takes us the wrong way. To combat this, I create tangible reminders that pull me back from the brink of my weak impulses. For example, I have my laptop’s desktop background set to a photo of my family, both because I love looking at them and because, when work gets really rough, these photos remind me of the people I am ultimately working for. And I’m not the only one who’s successfully using this strategy… A friend of mine who has paid off almost $100K of debt in the past five years has a copy of his credit card balance taped to his computer monitor; it serves as a constant reminder of the debt he still wants to pay off. Another friend keeps a photo of herself when she was 90 pounds heavier on her refrigerator as a reminder of the person she never wants to be again. Think of moments when you are most likely to give in to impulses that ultimately burn you out and take you farther away from what matters most to you. Then use visual reminders to interrupt the impulses and rebuild the momentum and inner passion that keeps you on the right track. Your ultimate goal is living a life uncluttered by most of the impulsive distractions people fill their lives with, leaving you with space for what truly matters. A life that isn’t constant busyness, rushing and resistance, but instead mindful contemplation, creation and connection with people and endeavors that truly matter. Even with a healthy set of visual reminders and good focus, the grind will sometimes burn you out… Your body may eventually grow weary, you may lie awake some nights listening to your past regrets, you may miss your only love, you may see the world around you overcome by negativity, or know your respect has been trampled on by unfriendly faces. Life happens! And there’s no doubt that it gets hard at times. That said, there is one action for daily healing and “breaking through” that works every time: BEING passionate with the small task in front of you. That’s the only positive effort that a battered mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or doubt, and never dream of regretting. And you don’t have to wait either. You don’t have to search around or “find passion” somewhere outside yourself. You can simply bring passion into the very next thing you do today. You can put your whole heart and soul into it! Again though, that’s easier said than done. Consider these questions I presented in a blog post a few months back: Be honest with yourself right now. If you’re still waiting to “find” something to be passionate about, what you need to do is the exact opposite! Put your heart and soul into the small task at hand! I’m certain you have plenty in your life right now that’s worth living for. You have people and lots of small circumstances you’re taking for granted. You have an endless reservoir of untapped potential within you, just waiting. Stop waiting! There is no next opportunity, only the one you have at this moment. Put your heart and soul (and gratitude) into what you’ve got right in front of you! “If you want to control your animals, give them a larger pasture.” That’s a quote Angel and I heard at a meditation retreat recently in a group discussion focused on the power of changing your attitude about the things you can’t change or don’t need to change. I see “the animals” and their “larger pasture” as a form of letting go and allowing things to be the way they are—instead of trying to tightly control something, you’re loosening up, giving it more space, a larger pasture. The animals will be happier—they will roam around and do what they naturally do. And yet your needs will be met too—you will have more space to be at peace with the way the animals are. This same philosophy holds true for many aspects of life—stepping back and allowing certain things to happen means these things will take care of themselves, and your needs will also be met. You will have less stress (and less to do), and more time and energy to work on the things that truly matter—the things you actually can control—like your priorities, your self-care, and your attitude about everything. Ultimately, as you move forward, you want to keep in mind that one of the greatest secrets to peace and happiness is letting most situations be what they are instead of what you think they should be, and then making the best of them.

Sometimes you will say something really small and simple, but it will fit right into an empty space in someone’s heart. This morning, I shared two quick stories on Zoom with a small group of digital Think Better, Live Better conference attendees. “I appreciate the perspective, and the invitation to change how I show up in my relationships,” one attendee replied. A dozen others said they agreed. So, I figured I’d share these stories with you in hopes that you find value in them too. Try to read each one slowly and thoughtfully. Take the little lessons to heart. See how doing so changes how you show up in your interactions and conversations with others today… A couple thousand years ago in ancient Greece, the great philosopher Socrates was strolling contemplatively around a community garden when a neighbor walked up to him and said, “You’re never in a million years going to believe what I just heard about our mutual friend…” “Wait,” Socrates interrupted, putting his hand up in the air. “Before you continue with this story, your words must pass the triple filter test?” “The what?” “The triple filter test,” Socrates said. The neighbor just stared at him with a blank expression. Socrates continued, “The first filter is Truth. Are you absolutely sure the story you are about to tell me is true?” “Well, no,” the neighbor said, “I literally just heard it from someone else I know.” “Ah-ha…” Socrates quickly replied, “then let’s move on to the second filter. Is what you are about to share Good in any way, shape or form?” “No… no,” the neighbor said, “This story is actually quite…” Before he could finish his sentence, Socrates interrupted him again, “Ahh… so it may not be true and it is definitely not good.” “That’s right,” the neighbor assured him. “Well, you may still be able to save yourself,” Socrates said. “Is anything about the story you want to share Useful?” The neighbor stared blankly again for a moment and then said, “No, I suppose it’s not really…” “So, you want to tell me something that may not be true, is definitely not good, and is not useful to know?” Socrates asked. The neighbor looked down at the ground and nodded. “Well, you have no good reason to tell me this story, and you have no good reason to believe it yourself,” Socrates added, as the neighbor dolefully walked away. . . . In many ways, not too much has changed since ancient Greece, especially when it comes to the stories we tell ourselves and drama we perpetuate… Every single day, we invest valuable time and energy into drama and hearsay. Many of us plug into social media first thing in the morning for reasons that have zero to do with what is true for us, good for us, and useful for those around us. Instead, we do it mostly as a default nervous reaction. In an expansive universe in which there are abundant opportunities to discover what’s true, what’s good, and what’s useful, when we do the opposite, we know it. And while making that compromise — with lots of mind-numbing gossip — is tolerable for a little while, eventually it isn’t anymore. Our negligence catches up to us, and we begin to feel pain. Don’t fall into the trap today. Instead take Socrates’ advice: simply focus on what is true, good, and useful. It worked well for Socrates a couple thousand years ago, and I assure you it continues to work well for many people today. You’d like Michelle a lot. Most people do. She’s the kind of person who listens when you talk, who smiles often, and who says things that make the people around her smile. She’s incredibly intelligent, but in a way that makes others feel comfortable. It’s the way she expresses herself in simple terms you can understand — almost like she’s articulating the thoughts you already have in your head, but haven’t quite found the right words to say aloud. And it doesn’t matter who you are either. Michelle always has a way of relating to you. Because, in a way, she’s been there with you all along. She can think like you, so she understands you. It’s truly a special gift. So many of us have limitations in our perceptions. We understand the soldiers but not the politics governing the wars. We understand the people who go to the movies but not the ones who attend rodeos. But somehow, Michelle gets all of us. Again, it’s her gift. If she hasn’t actually been to the rodeo you’re talking about — or any rodeo at all for that matter — she’ll be honest about it, but she’ll make you feel as if she was right there with you when you attended. And once you return home after spending a night with Michelle, you’ll catch yourself smiling and thinking about how there needs to be more people like her in the world. Because if there were, there would be far less to worry about. Michelle passed away recently. I don’t really want to discuss the details right now, because honestly, they aren’t relevant. It could have been a car accident. It could have been old age. We are often far too concerned with how people died, rather than how they lived. And I want you to know how Michelle lived. She told stories — lots of stories that contained beautiful, subtle insights and wisdom about our lives and the world around us. And today, I want to share with you the last story she told me before she died: “One Sunday morning when I was a little girl, my father surprised me and took me to the fishing docks. But instead of fishing, like all the other little girls and boys were doing with their parents, we sat down on the end of one of the docks and watched all the other children fish. For over an hour, we sat there and watched until we left without ever casting a single fishing line into the water. I was simultaneously sad and angry. On the drive home I told my father that I’d never forgive him for being so mean to me. He looked at me, smiled and said, “I love you, Michelle.” When I didn’t respond, he asked, “Did you notice how happy all the other little girls and boys were? Did you see their smiles? Could you feel the happiness in their hearts?” After a moment of silence I quickly snapped, “I don’t really care! I just want to go fishing like everyone else!” My father took a deep breath and kept driving. We went back to the fishing docks dozens of Sunday mornings throughout my childhood. And each time we saw dozens of other little girls and boys jumping and laughing and celebrating as they reeled in fish. But we still never cast a single fishing line into the water. We just sat there on the end of that same dock and watched. And my father never explained why. But he didn’t need to. Because years later, after I entered adulthood, and found myself volunteering at a local homeless shelter, I suddenly realized that those mornings spent sitting on that dock was where I learned how to love.” . . . Michelle’s last story continues to make me think… Too often we pass people in a hurry, without caring or thinking twice. Or we judge those who aren’t moving at our pace. And rarely do we ever stop. Just to witness. Or to listen. Or to love. Because we forget, or perhaps never learned, that every passing face represents a story just as captivating, complicated and worthy as our own. Everyone has gone through something that has inadvertently changed them and forced them to struggle, adapt and grow. Everyone’s smile has been earned. Everyone we meet has fought hard, and continues to fight in some way. And to them, their issues are equally as significant and worthwhile as whatever we’re going through. Pausing from time to time to appreciate all the human beings around us opens our minds. Sharing in their happiness (or their frustrations) opens our hearts. When we take time to pause — to truly witness and listen, instead of bypassing or judging too quickly — we can learn so much… about ourselves, about each other, and about real love. Above all, I hope the short stories above remind you that being kind to everyone — even someone you disagree with, dislike, or don’t even know — doesn’t mean you’re fake. It means you’re mature enough to control your emotions and channel them effectively. So, be kind today. 🙂 And also remind yourself that people are generally kinder when they are happier, which says a whole lot about the people you meet who aren’t so kind to you. Truly, let’s do our best to take it all to heart. Or, as Marc so eloquently stated in his most recent blog post… Be a blessing. Be a friend. Encourage someone. Take time to care. Let your words heal, and not wound. You have the power to improve someone else’s day, perhaps even their whole life, simply by giving them your sincere presence, compassion and kindness today. Do it! … And please leave us a comment before you go… Did the two stories in this post resonate with you? Which one resonated the most? Leave a reply below and share your thoughts with us.

What goes around comes around. No one has ever made themselves strong by showing how small someone else is. Everyone you meet is learning something, is afraid of something, loves something, and has lost something. Know this. And be extra kind today. In other words, don’t just preach online. Actually do the difficult things, too. Be compassionate in whatever way you can. Be a beacon of hope to people you pass on the street. Embody what you preach. Many of the kindest gestures you’ll ever make, and the most important things you’ll ever do, won’t come easy and will never be seen publicly. Do them anyway… The closest thing to being cared for is to care for others. Again, we are all in this together and we should treat each other as such. The very demons that torment each of us, torment others all over the world. It is our challenges and troubles that connect us at the deepest level. If you think about the people who have had the greatest positive effect on your life—the ones who truly made a difference—you will likely realize that they aren’t the ones that tried to give you all the answers or solve all your problems. They’re the ones who sat silently with you when you needed a moment to think, who lent you a shoulder when you needed to cry, and who tolerated not having all the answers, but stood beside you anyway. Be this person for those around you every chance you get. Life’s greatest privilege is to become who you truly are. You have to dare to be yourself, one hundred percent, however anxious or odd that self may prove to be. The people who support you in doing so are extraordinary. Appreciate these people and their kindness, and pay it forward when you’re able. Never bully someone into silence. Never victimize others for being different. Accept no one’s close-minded definition of another person. Let people define themselves. You have the ability to show people how awesome they are, just the way they are. So act on this ability without hesitation; and don’t forget to show yourself the same courtesy. Ultimately, how far you go in life depends on your willingness to be helpful to the young, respectful to the aged, tender with the hurt, supportive of the striving, and patient with those who are weaker or stronger than the majority. Trust is the bedrock of all healthy communication, and when trust is broken it takes a long time and commitment on the part of both parties involved to repair it and heal. The key thing to remember here is that secrets can be just as deceitful as openly telling a lie. All too often, Angel and I will hear a course student or a Think Better, Live Better attendee say something like, “I didn’t tell him but I didn’t lie about it, either.” This statement is a contradiction, as omissions are lies. If you’re covering up your tracks or withholding the truth in any way, it’s only a matter of time before the truth comes out and trust in the relationship completely breaks down. So speak the truth openly and kindly, always. Frequent name-calling, threats, eye-rolling, belittling, mockery, hostile teasing, etc. In whatever form, gestures like these are poisonous to a relationship because they convey hate. And it’s virtually impossible to resolve an interpersonal dispute of any kind when the other person is constantly receiving the message that you hate them. Also, keep in mind that if someone makes a mistake and you choose to forgive them, your actions must reinforce your words. In other words, let bygones be bygones. Don’t use their past wrongdoings to justify your present righteousness. When you constantly use someone’s past wrongdoings to make yourself seem “better” than them (“I’m better than you because, unlike you, I didn’t do XYZ in the past.”), it’s a lose-lose situation. Replace your negative thoughts with positive communication! Because the truth is, if you’re throwing hateful gestures at a person instead of communicating with them, there’s a good chance they don’t even know why you’re being so mean. And remember, the single greatest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place. When we hear only what we want to hear, we’re not really listening. We must listen to what we don’t want to hear too. Because that’s how we grow stronger, together. In other words, no more silent treatments of any kind! Tuning out, ignoring, disengaging, refusing to acknowledge, etc. All variations of the silent treatment don’t just remove the other person from the argument you’re having with them, it ends up removing them, emotionally, from the relationship you have with them, and the understanding you hope to reach. When you’re ignoring someone, you’re really teaching them to live without you—to ignore you right back. If that’s what you want, be clear about it. And if not, tune back in! You don’t have to tell people that you care, just show them. In your relationships and interactions with others, nothing you can give is more appreciated than your sincere, focused attention. Being with someone, listening without a clock and without anticipation of results is the ultimate compliment. It is indeed the most valued gesture you can make to another human being. When we pay attention to each other we breathe new life into each other. With frequent attention and affection our relationships flourish, and we as individuals grow wiser and stronger. We help heal each other’s wounds and support each other’s growth. So give someone the gift of YOU—your time, undivided attention and kindness. Give genuine praise whenever possible. Doing so can be difficult, yet it’s a mighty act of service. Start noticing what you like about others and speak up. Having an appreciation for how amazing the people around you are is extremely rewarding. It’s an investment in them that doesn’t cost you a thing, and the returns can be astounding. Not only will they feel empowered, but also what goes around comes around, and sooner or later the people you’re cheering for will start cheering for you too. Finally, be sure to follow this rule: “Praise in public, penalize in private.” Never publicly ridicule someone when you have the option not to. If you don’t understand someone, ask questions. If you don’t agree with them, respectfully tell them. But don’t judge them behind their back to everyone else. Remembering all of the aforementioned—and living accordingly—of course, is sometimes much easier said than done. But please commit yourself to practicing. Commit yourself to doing the difficult things. Above all, don’t stop learning. Don’t stop investing in yourself. Study. Read. Watch. Engage deeply with people, including those who think differently. Ask questions. Listen closely. And don’t just grow in knowledge. Be a person who gives back. Use what you’re learning to make a difference. The bottom line is that this day will never come again… Be a blessing. Be a friend. Encourage someone. Take time to care. Let your words heal, and not wound. You have the power to improve someone else’s day, perhaps even their whole life, simply by giving them your sincere presence, compassion and kindness today. Do it! … And please leave us a comment before you go… Did this short post resonate with you? Which point resonated the most? Leave a reply below and share your thoughts with us.

An Open Letter to Those Who Want to Make a Bigger Difference Right Now|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/ella-and-marilyn.jpg?resize=500%2C273&ssl=1| Paths are Made by Walking, Not Waiting: One Lesson We Forget in Hard Times|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/paths-are-made-by-walking.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| We waste our time waiting for a path to appear. But it never does. Because we forget that paths are made by walking, not waiting. And we forget that there’s absolutely nothing about our present circumstances that prevents us from making progress again, one tiny step at a time. So, let’s cut to the chase today: What we truly need to do is often what we most feel like avoiding. This is a harsh reality, even in our present times. Because, if we don’t go after what we want, we will never get it. If we don’t ask the right questions, we will always get the wrong answers. If we don’t take a step forward, we are always going to be standing in the same exact place. Life is a journey comprised of small steps. The key is to take these steps, every single day, even during harder times that require us to be extra resourceful. To an extent, we know this already, right? Yet how often are we stuck in a cycle of worry, fear, and other forms of over-thinking? How often are we aimlessly distracted? And how often do we hide from our problems, or procrastinate? After consistently working on my mindfulness and time management habits, I’ve become reasonably proficient at getting things done with minimal distraction and procrastination, even while working from home. Today, for example, I proof-read and cleaned up a chapter in a new book Marc and I are co-writing, coached five of our Getting Back to Happy Course students, responded to comments and emails from dozens of students and readers, worked on business planning and strategizing for a few active projects, spent quality time with my family, and of course now I’m writing the words you’re presently reading. It might seem like a lot, but it happens one small step at a time, with presence and focus. With that said, however, I’ll be the first to admit that Marc and I still struggle with some detrimental habits that sneak up on us sometimes and get in the way of our effectiveness (because we’re human). And there is one particular habit we struggle with that’s super common among our friends, family, acquaintances, and students alike—this is something we all do that ends up wasting our lives, one precious moment at a time. The word “waste” may sound overly dramatic, but it’s really not. After spending over a decade coaching hundreds of people, and working through my own personal issues, there’s little doubt that this is one of the most popular ways we all collectively waste our lives: Self-discipline is a skill. It’s the ability to focus and overcome distractions. It involves acting according to what you know is right instead of how you feel in the moment (perhaps tired or lazy or uneasy). It typically requires sacrificing immediate pleasure and excitement for what matters most in life. A lack of self-discipline for most of us is often the result of a lack of focus. In other words, we tell ourselves we are going to work on something, but then we don’t. When this happens to me, first and foremost, I forgive myself for messing up, and then I strive to be mindful about what’s really going on. Am I procrastinating for some reason? Am I distracted? Am I taking the easy way out? Instead of telling myself that I’m “bad” or “undisciplined,” I try to productively uncover a more specific, solvable problem, and then address it. For example, I was feeling kind of down yesterday at lunchtime, so I wrote down a quick list of what was contributing to the funk I was in: So, there were five factors contributing to my funk. And that’s actually quite a few distinct things to be dealing with at once. Initially it felt depressing to think about all the things I needed to focus on in order to feel better and move forward. Of course, I knew I couldn’t focus on everything at once, so I just started with one tiny step. I meditated for a five minutes. Then I took another step: I made a list of what I needed to do—I organized my obligations and prioritized them. Another step: I went for a walk and got my body moving. Then another step: I sat down with Marc, and I apologized first. Suddenly, with these tiny steps, I started to feel better. So, I moved on to the next tiny step and the next. Then I took a break and spent a some time with my son, to play with him, and read to him. I ate a healthy meal. I reflected on my uncertainty and pain in a positive way, and stayed with my feelings as long as I could, with compassion and openness. I went to bed early and got a good night’s sleep. All just one step at a time. And like I mentioned, I woke up this morning and really hit the ground running, because all of those tiny steps I took yesterday afternoon changed my mood and my trajectory. The same can be true for you… The concept of taking it one step at a time might seem ridiculously obvious, but when life gets hard we tend to lose our better judgement—we all get caught up in the moment and find ourselves yearning for instant gratification. We want what we want, and we want it now! And this yearning often tricks us into taking on too much too soon. Marc and I have seen this transpire hundreds of times over the years: a coaching client or course student wants to achieve a big goal or life change (or multiple big goals or life changes) all at once, and can’t choose just one or two daily rituals to begin focusing on, so nothing worthwhile ever gets done. Let this common mistake—this quick-fix mentality—be your reminder today. You can’t lift a thousand pounds all at once, yet you can easily lift one pound a thousand times. Small, repeated, incremental efforts will get you closer to what you ultimately want. It doesn’t happen in an instant, but it does happen a lot faster than not getting there at all. But… Seriously! What do you do if your life is in complete disarray, you have hardly any self-discipline or consistent routines, can’t stick to anything, procrastinate constantly, and feel completely out of control right now? How do you get started with building a healthy ritual of self-discipline when you have so many changes to make? Again, you start small. Very small. If you don’t know where to start, let me suggest that you start by simply washing your dishes. Yes, I mean literally washing your dishes. It’s just one small step forward: When you eat your oatmeal, wash your bowl and spoon. When you finish drinking your morning coffee, rinse the coffee pot and your mug. Don’t leave any dirty dishes in the sink or on the counter for later. Wash them immediately. Form this ritual one dish at a time, one day at a time. Once you do this consistently for a couple weeks, you can start making sure the sink has been wiped clean too. Then the counter. Then put your clothes where they belong when you take them off. Then start doing a few sit-ups every morning. Eat a few vegetables for dinner. And so forth. Do one of these at a time, and you’ll start to build a healthy ritual of self-discipline, and finally know yourself to be capable of doing what must be done… and finishing what you start. But, for right now, just wash your dishes. With focus and presence. That is the path forward. Did this post resonate with you today? Which specific point resonated the most?

"9 Things it’s Not Too Late to Start Doing for Yourself|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/wp-content/uploads/9-not-too-late-start.jpg?resize=500%2C400&ssl=1| Right now, don’t judge or berate yourself for how long your journey is taking. We all need our own time to travel our own distance. And every step is necessary. Consider this post your reminder… Marc and I have spent the past 12 years coaching people of all ages and demographics, from all over the world. This experience has taught us, above all, that everyone journeys in their own way. Some people start their careers right out of college in their early twenties, only to find themselves burnt out and starting over when they reach their early thirties. Others start working minimum wage jobs right out of high school and work their way up the corporate ladder, retiring happily in their mid-sixties. Some people fall in love and get married in their mid-twenties, but wind up divorced a few years later. Others marry in their early forties and spend four decades with their soul mate. Some couples are ridiculed for becoming teen parents, but end up living to meet their children’s children. Other couples get pregnant in their mid-forties and are ridiculed for putting their unborn children at risk. Again, everyone’s journey is different. And everyone is doing life right, in their own way. So, just remind yourself right now: there are no absolutes in life. And there certainly are no fixed timelines. YOU are NOT too late to make the best of things! You’re exactly where you need to be right now. Which means . . . All great achievements require time and hard work. Good things don’t come easy. And consistent practice is the only way you can endure the gray periods. When we want things to be easy, and expect them to be, we are inevitably disappointed. Our disappointment then motivates us to give up too soon. And the thing with giving up too soon is you never know. You never know whether you could have put in the effort and done something incredible with your life. I’ve personally pushed myself pretty hard over the years, because I was sick of the same old problems. What about you? Find the courage to do the hard things in life. The things no one else is doing. The things that frighten you. The things others can’t do for you. The things that make you question how much longer you can hold on and push forward. Because those are the things that define you. Those are the things that make the difference between existing and living—between knowing the path and walking the path… between a life of mediocrity and a life filled with happiness and success. Yes, find the courage! And remember, courage doesn’t always roar out loud. Sometimes courage is simply the quiet voice at the very end of the evening, whispering, “I will try again tomorrow.” We are products of what we know, but we don’t have to be prisoners of it. When you stop learning you stop living a meaningful life. Life’s richness does not come from always residing within familiar and comfortable territory. It’s when you venture out away from the familiar that you grow stronger and more capable. You must hold tightly to your core values while at the same time opening your heart and mind to new ideas, feelings and experiences. Your own perspective will become clearer when you look at things from different angles. Find ways to provide a healthy challenge to your current understanding of life, and you will discover and experience far more of life’s magic in the days ahead. Bottom line: As long as you are breathing, you are only just beginning. Let go of the foolish need to compare, and you’ll free yourself to accomplish what matters most to you. Sometimes you have to remind yourself that you don’t have to always be and do what everyone else is being and doing. If you compete with others, you will become bitter. If you compete with a previous version of yourself, you will become better. It’s as simple as that. You are not in competition with anybody except yourself—plan to outdo your past, not other people. And keep in mind that when you’re not competing against others, you can instead work with them on a common goal. You can use your combined insights and talents to achieve what none of you can alone. Incredible personal growth and learning occurs through relationships when the competitive spirit is replaced with a collaborative one. I don’t need anyone’s affection or approval in order to be good enough in my own eyes. Repeat that to yourself and let it sink in. Other people can’t validate you. In fact, when someone rejects or abandons or judges you, 99% of the time it isn’t actually about you. It’s about them and their own insecurities, limitations, and needs, and you don’t have to internalize any of it. Your worth isn’t contingent upon other people’s acceptance of you—it’s something inherent. You are alive, and therefore you matter. You’re allowed to think things and feel things. You’re allowed to assert your needs and take up space. You’re allowed to hold on to the truth that who you are is worthy. And you’re allowed to create some healthy distance from anyone who insists on making you feel otherwise. Another driver cut you off in traffic. Your friend never texted you back. Your coworker went to lunch without you. Everyone can find a reason to be offended on a daily basis. But what caused you to be offended? You took things personally and dramatically. You made it all about YOU by assigning negative intent to these otherwise arbitrary actions. And you let your temper roar. Don’t do this to yourself. Don’t pretend like everyone’s daily actions are about YOU. They aren’t. People’s actions are about THEM. So let it GO! How would your life be different if you walked away from drama, gossip and nonconstructive assumptions? Let today be the day you find out. Life gets a lot easier when you are your own best friend. So don’t forget about YOU out there, and don’t be too hard on yourself either. There are plenty of others that will do both of these things for you. Remember, there’s absolutely nothing selfish about self-care. If you don’t take good care of yourself, then you can’t take good care of anyone else. Because we can’t give what we don’t have. Treat yourself right and you’ll be life-giving to others. Once your own self-care is in order, there is no exercise better for your heart and mind than reaching down and lifting people up. Truly, generosity isn’t just to help others, it’s also to liberate you. It’s what keeps the things you own from owning you. Which is why you cannot live abundantly until you have done something nice for someone who can never repay you. Meditate on this and live graciously today. Sometimes your mind unnecessarily wrestles with events that aren’t even remotely likely. Your sore throat is life threatening. Your lost driver’s license fell into the hands of a miscreant looking to steal your identity. Negativity like this only breeds more negativity. It’s a happiness riptide. It will carry you away from the shore and, if you don’t swim away, it will pull you under. Stop over-thinking every dilemma. Answers come to a relaxed mind. Space allows things to fall into place. A calm attitude yields the best results. When your fears and anxieties have you looking too deeply into things, it creates problems—it doesn’t fix them. If you think and you think and you think, you’ll think yourself right out of happiness a dozen times, and never once into it. Before you can truly LIVE today, a part of you has to die first. You have to let go and bury what could have been, how you should have responded and what you wish you would have done differently. You have to accept that you can’t change a past experience, opinions of others at that moment in time, or outcomes from their choices or yours. When you finally accept this truth, then you will finally understand the true meaning of forgiving yourself and others. From this point you will finally be present and free. Remember, you’ve been through a lot, but you’ve grown a lot too. Give yourself credit for your resilience, and step forward again today with grace. If you’re struggling with any of these points, know that you are not alone. Many of us are right there with you, working hard to feel better, think more clearly, and live a life free of addiction. This is precisely why Marc and I wrote the NEW edition of 1,000 Little Things Happy Successful People Do Differently. It’s filled with short, concise tips on how to do just that. And believe it or not, Marc and I review a lot of our own material on a regular basis too, just to center our minds on these positive principles. The bottom line is that it’s never too late to take a step in the right direction. It’s never too late to break free and become the person you are capable of being!

An Open Letter to Those Who Have Lied to Impress Others|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/1-open-letter-lied-to-impress.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| 20 Five-Minute Journaling Prompts for a Mentally Strong Finish to January|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/19-journal-prompts.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| Like many people, Angel and I spent years struggling to make even the slightest bit of progress on the goals we had set for ourselves. We started new workout programs with incredible optimism at least a couple dozen times.  We threw away all the junk food in our house more times than I can even remember.  We tried waking up earlier, meditating, reading more often, writing a book, getting out of debt, running a business, and more… But, for the longest time, we failed on all fronts. We’d get started with a new goal, and then we’d get derailed. And boy did we feel horrible! We often felt like losers … like no matter how hard we tried, our goals were out of reach!  And we’d berate ourselves constantly for not being stronger, smarter, and more disciplined. But what Angel and I didn’t realize, until we started successfully achieving our goals a few years later, is that it was never a matter of us not having enough strength, intelligence, or discipline.  It was a matter of us focusing on our goals in an ineffective way. In fact, believe it or not, we were actually focusing on our goals too much. Yes, you read that right.  It sounds counterintuitive, but it’s the truth. Watch this quick video Angel and I recorded for you, and let us explain what we started focusing on instead…  Now that you’ve watched the video, and you have a better understanding of what rituals are and why they’re so incredibly important, it’s time to memorize and live by a simple rule… Goals don’t make positive changes happen, daily rituals do. Seriously, meditate on that for a moment. Because too often we obsess ourselves with a goal – an end result – but are completely unfocused when it comes to the ritual – the recurring steps – that ultimately make the goal happen.  And so the weight of this unrealized goal sits heavy on our shoulders, and it slows us down to a crawl. Does that sound at all familiar? If so, it’s time to shift your focus AWAY from your goals.  Think about this… If you completely ignored one of your goals for the next few weeks and instead focused solely on the daily rituals that reinforce this goal, would you still get positive results? For example, if you were trying to lose weight and you ignored your goal to lose 25 pounds, and instead focused only on eating healthy and exercising each day, would you still get results? YES, you would!  Gradually, you would get closer and closer to your goal without even thinking about it. The bottom line is that nothing will change in your life unless you make daily rituals that reinforce what you hope to achieve.  Believe me, over the past decade Angel and I have successfully worked with thousands of course students and live event attendees from around the world who were struggling to achieve things, so this strategy is well tested.  We’ve tried weekly action steps with people, tasks they do in semi-flexible increments, big monthly milestones, and dozens of other variations and combinations of strategies.  None of them work well in the long run except daily rituals. If you’re not willing to make it a daily ritual, you don’t really want to change your life as much as you say you do – you don’t really want to achieve that “important” goal.  You only like the idea of learning to be fit/writing a book/building a business/selling your art/etc.  You don’t actually want to do it, every day. But if you DO want it as much as you say you do, here are some… (Note: Angel and I build small, daily, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy course.)

Remind yourself that the New Year means nothing if your mind is still boxed up in its comfort zone. Don’t fool yourself into living the same year 90 times and calling it a life. And don’t just think outside the box in 2020… Think like there is no box. Open your mind! How? Start by asking yourself better questions. Questions that break you away from all the comfortable distractions in your life, so you can refocus your thinking on what matters most… 1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  8.  9.  10.  11.  12.  13.  14.  15.  16.  17.  18.  19.  20. (And what should everyone be able to say before the end of 2020?) As I alluded to in the intro, the questions you ask yourself on a regular basis can determine the type of person you become. Self-questioning, when leveraged effectively and consistently, gradually frees your mind to focus on what matters most. This process is something Marc and I have successfully guided hundreds of our coaching clients and course students through over the past decade, to help them cope with the various debilitating sources of stress that were holding them back. If you’d like to better cope with the stress in your own life in 2020, I’ll give you a few bonus questions to consider. Unlike the questions above, which focus on the big picture of what’s important to you, the following will support you when you’re derailed by the frustrations of life’s smaller everyday encounters. The key to using these questions is embracing the fact that most of the frustrations and stress in your daily life could be avoided if you would simply take the time to ask, “What else could this mean?” So next time a random life situation starts to get the best of you, pause, take a deep breath, and then ask yourself: Give yourself the space to think it through carefully. Mull it over consciously. And see how doing so opens your mind to respond more peacefully and appropriately in the year ahead. (Note: Self-questioning and other self-coaching practices are also covered in detail in our New York Times bestselling book, Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs.) Above all, what you need to remember is that it’s not the answers you get from others, but the questions you ask yourself that will help you grow stronger. So I challenge you to re-read and reference all the questions above throughout the year. And keep in mind that they have no right or wrong answers. Because asking the right questions of yourself, regularly, is the answer. And before you go, please share your thoughts with us in the comments section below. We’d love to read your response to question #3 above: What’s the #1 change you need to make in your life in 2020?

"4 Reasons You Need to Keep Doing Hard Things to Be Happy, Healthy and Successful|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/4-keep-doing-hard-things.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| You need to do hard things to be happy, healthy and successful. Because the hard things ultimately build you up and change your life. If you already feel like you’re at the end your rope today with little slack left to hold on to, realize your mind is lying to you. It has imprisoned you by reciting self-defeating stories in your head—stories about your mistakes and what you should have done differently. And you’ve begun to believe that you’re really stuck. But you’re NOT. You are alive in an immense world with infinite destinations. Take a moment to remind yourself of this fact. Go outside. Look up at the sky and the clouds or the stars. THIS is the world in which you really live. Breathe it in. Then look at your current situation again. Remember that adversity—doing and dealing with the hard things in life—is the first path to truth. Your defeats often serve as well as your victories to shake your spirit and light your way. You just have to hold on tight, embrace the daily pain, and burn it as fuel for your journey. Easier said than done, of course. Which is why you need to continually remind yourself… Life can be a struggle. It will break you sometimes. Nobody can protect you from that. And hiding alone in a cave somewhere won’t either, for prolonged solitude will also break you with an endless thirst for connection. You must dare to love. You must dare to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to sacrifice your time and risk your heart. You are here to be bruised by life. And when it happens that you are hurt, or betrayed, or rejected, let yourself sit quietly with your eyes closed and remember all the good times you had, and all the sweetness you tasted, and everything you learned. Tell yourself how amazing it was to live, and then open your eyes and live some more. To never struggle would be to never have been blessed with life. It is within the depths of darkness that you discover within you an inextinguishable light, and it is this light that illuminates the way forward. (This process is something Angel and I discuss in the Adversity chapter of the NEW volume of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Adversity is like walking in to a turbulent windstorm. As you fight to push through it, you not only gain strength, but it tears away from you all but the essential parts of you that cannot be torn. Once you come out of the storm you see yourself as you really are in raw form, still holding the passions and ideas that move you, and little else. Ultimately, there is only what you want and what happens. When you don’t get what you want, there is only grabbing on and holding tight to the passions and ideas that move you. These are the lusts that matter—the love that defines you. It is this kind of love that drives you forward and even when the going gets tough. It is this kind of love that should never be overlooked. Sometimes when the going gets really tough, the world seems like it’s spinning too fast and you feel completely out of control. It seems like you’re losing your mind and going crazy, but you’re not. You need to pause and take a deep breath. Just about every emotional issue imaginable, from fear to anxiety to the onset of depression, is triggered by a mounting build-up of stress. Stress impedes your ability to think straight and see the world as it is—a world that is not spinning too fast or burning to the ground. Being extremely stressed-out and feeling overwhelmed is not a sign that you are psychotic or “going crazy.” It’s just that stressful experiences make it harder to think clearly and can make you think you’re more out of control than you actually are. The craziness you feel is stress. It’s not time to give up, it’s time to regroup and hold tight to your sanity. The more you relax, the saner you will feel. Ask yourself: If you are experiencing any of the above issues, you know what you need to address to reduce your stress. The vast majority of us never go crazy; the vast majority of us simply fear, at some point, that we may go crazy based on stress factors we allow to reside in our present life situations. So let your stress guide you—make sure you fill your time with meaningful activity, get enough sleep, eat well and manage your stress so it doesn’t mange you. (Note: Angel and I customize and implement this process with our students in the Getting Back to Happy Course & Coaching.) You are only destined to become one person—the person you decide to be. Do not let your own negativity walk all over you with it’s dirty feet. You feel a unique gift burning inside you that you want to offer to the world, to help move it in the right direction. It may be covered up by days and weeks of waiting, doubting and defeat, but it’s present and as bright as ever. If you look deeply enough, you’ll find it. There is a capable person inside you that wants to soar, to create, to build, to love, to inspire, to do far more than just exist. Your everyday chores and difficult tasks can be a prison or a pathway. It all depends on you. No matter how far down you think you’ve traveled, there is always a road leading to higher ground. There are always great possibilities in front of you, because you are always able to take a small step forward. Stay true to yourself. Hold on to your values and passions. Never be ashamed of doing what feels right. Decide what you think is right and gradually step in that direction. There’s no shame in feeling overwhelmed. You are not a robot; and even if you were, you’d still need to stop for maintenance once in a while. There is no shame in admitting to yourself that you feel tired, doubtful, and low today. This is a natural part of being human. The simple fact that you are aware of this means you are able to turn things around, one day at a time, starting now.

How to Make Life Simple Again|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/how-to-make-life-simple.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| Life gets a lot simpler when you clear the clutter that makes it complicated. Bring your attention back to what’s important, and move forward with your life. Your days fill up so fast, and they are so rushed and packed with distractions—sometimes they literally seem to be bursting at the seams. I know exactly how you feel. This used to be my life too. Before I started simplifying my life, I was being pulled in dozens of different directions every day and never had enough time to get everything done. Naturally, I wanted to do a great job with each obligation I had, and somehow I had convinced myself that I could do it all. But the reality was I was stretched way too thin, and thus I was doing a lousy job at everything and completely stressing myself out in the process. This feeling of being mind-numbingly busy and overbooked is a huge source of stress for most people, and stress is perhaps the single most important determining factor of whether we’re healthy and happy, or sick and tired, in the long run. Unless you want your health to decline and your stress to continue to skyrocket, you must start simplifying. So how can you simplify your life? It’s not as hard as you might imagine… Visualizing your perfect day is important not necessarily because it will be a recurring reality, but because it’s crucial to understand what a “simple life” really means to you. It’s different for everyone—for me, it means practicing my morning gratitude meditation, quiet writing and reading time, and spending a few quality hours with Marc and our son, Mac. For others, it’s a long morning walk, afternoon yoga, a productive day at the office, and a hot bath before bed. And for others, it’s simply lots of time to focus on an important life goal, while still leaving enough time to get a good night’s rest. Take a few moments now to visualize what a “simple day” means to you. Besides the art of getting things done, there is the often-forgotten art of leaving things undone. The simplicity and efficiency of a day relies heavily on the elimination of non-essentials. The foundation of simplifying is this: So take time to identify the most important projects, people and experiences (5 at most), and then see what activities, tasks and commitments fit in with that list. Once you’ve identified what’s important—your priorities, along with your vision of the “perfect day”—you need to start saying “no” to things that do not support what’s important to you, and that are getting in the way of your perfect day. The best thing you can say “no” to is an unimportant commitment. Think about it… Today you say yes to a Facebook party invitation, tomorrow you say yes when a neighbor asks you to help him move some furniture, then you get asked to a quick lunch meeting, then you decide to volunteer at your son’s youth group. One yes at a time, and soon your days are too busy and complicated and you don’t know where you went wrong. List and evaluate your commitments (professional, personal, civic, etc.), especially the recurring ones, and say no to at least one of them today. It just takes a quick call or a short email, and you’ll instantly feel a weight lifted. Take time every morning to identify 1-3 Most Important Tasks (MITs) for the day, and cut out the rest as much as possible (not counting little, necessary things, like tying your shoes or dropping the kids off at school). Address your other obligations right then and there, and tell the associated people that you really want to help, but your plate is full today. You can’t serve them well, so regretfully you must say “no.” Once you’re down to a manageable list of tasks (1-3 is ideal, but certainly don’t try to do more than 7), it’s best to give each some allotted time—a few hours for one, and then a few hours for another, etc. Instead of being in a stressful task-switching state of mind, just take your next task, let everything else go, and just be in the moment with this one task for the allotted time. Do this, and you will notice a difference. Limiting your tasks like this helps you focus and embrace the reality that you’re not going to get everything done in one day. Once you know you’re actually working on the right tasks, eliminating all distractions for a set time while you work is one of the most effective ways to get things done. So, lock your door, put a sign up, turn off your phone, close your email application, disconnect your internet connection, etc. You can’t remain in hiding forever, but you can be twice as productive while you are. Do whatever it takes to create a quiet, distraction-free environment where you can focus on what’s important. Again, let yourself be immersed in the task at hand by letting go of the feeling that you need to quickly rush through it—that you need to move on to the next task waiting for you. There will always be a next task, because that’s the nature of TO-DO lists—they’re never-ending. So let those later tasks come later. Just be 100% in this one task, like it’s your entire world. Bottom line: Slow down. Breathe. Review your commitments and goals. Put first things first. Do one task at a time. Start now. Take a 5-minute break in an hour. Repeat. (And remember, results are more important than the time it takes to achieve them.) There are a lot of little tasks you need to do throughout the day. Don’t let them disrupt the more important stuff. To be more productive, batch them up and do them all at once, preferably later in the day. For example, instead of checking your personal email throughout the day, handle all of it once a day, perhaps at 4pm as the day is winding down. Do all your miscellaneous paperwork at once (bills, forms, etc.). And once you’ve completed a batch of small tasks (like processing all your email), cut yourself off and move on to the next small thing if necessary. The key is to make sure you don’t let the small things get in the way of the big ones. Do NOT get stuck on one small thing all day, or even half a day. I may sound like a broken record at this point, but it’s crucial to understand that overcommitting is the biggest mistake most people make against living a simpler life. It’s tempting to fill in every waking minute of the day with tasks. Don’t do this to yourself. Leave space. The space between the things we do is just as important as the things we do. So leave a little space between your tasks. Take a break to stretch, take a short walk outside, drink a glass of water, perhaps do some simple deep breathing exercises. Enjoy the space, and breathe. Your overarching goal is living a life uncluttered by most of the things people fill their lives with, leaving you with space for what truly matters. A life that isn’t constant busyness, rushing and stress, but instead mindful contemplation, creation and connection with people and projects you love. (Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Simplicity” chapter of the brand NEW volume of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) A simpler, more positive mindset can be created anytime and anyplace with a change in thinking. That’s right, frustration and stress come from the way you react, not the way things are. Adjust your attitude, and the frustration and stress evaporates. The simplest secret to doing this is letting every circumstance be what it is in the moment, instead of what you think it should be, and then making the best of it. It’s about being grateful for what is, and then working WITH it, not against it. This kind of humble gratitude always makes life easier to deal with. Because happiness comes easier when you stop complaining about your problems and you start being grateful for all the problems you don’t have. (Note: Marc and I customize and implement all of the aforementioned points with our students in the Getting Back to Happy Course & Coaching.)

Today our son, Mac, started Kindergarten. The experience of dropping him off for his very first day of school struck so many emotions in me. As every parent of a school-age child can attest, the very first day of school is a learning experience in and of itself. It’s one of those little milestones you anticipate and always remember. Anyway, I awoke this morning thinking about the whole experience—of childhood, parenthood, and everything in between—and two thoughts immediately came to mind: So in no particular order, here are 40 things I intend to tell him and his little friends, repeatedly, over the next several years: Above all, I think the best thing we can do for our kids as they grow is to allow them to do things for themselves, allow them to be strong and responsible, allow them the freedom to experience things on their own terms, allow them to take the bus or the train and learn from life firsthand… allow them to be better people, allow them to believe more in themselves. What would you add to the list? What else do you want to tell your kids before they’re “too cool” to hear your wisdom? 😉 We love hearing from YOU.

Don’t ignore them. Sometimes you have to do what’s best for you and your life, not what’s best for everyone else. A life spent ceaselessly trying to please people who are perhaps incapable of ever being pleased, or trying too hard to always be seen as doing “what’s expected of you,” is a sure road to a regretful existence. Marc and I were on this road once, but I’m happy to say we’re paving our own path now based on our own needs, morals and values. And today I hope to inspire you to do the same… Do more than just exist. We all exist. The question is: Do you live? Marc and I eventually realized existing without ever truly living was not what we wanted for ourselves. So we made changes – we gradually embraced the points discussed in this article and never looked back. If you are in the same place we once were – seeking approval from everyone for every little thing you do – please take this post to heart and start making changes today. Life is too short not to. Yes, it’s your turn to give up trying to live up to people’s expectations All the love and validation you need is yours to give yourself. Let that sink in. Then leverage the reminders above as needed to let it sink in even deeper. And, please leave Marc and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this post. Your feedback is important to us.  🙂 (Finally, if you haven’t done so already, be sure to sign-up for our free newsletter to receive new articles like this in your inbox each week.) 6 Insanely Common Reasons You Are Becoming Your Own Worst Enemy|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/6-becoming-worst-enemy.jpg?resize=500%2C405&ssl=1| Inner peace begins the moment you take a deep breath and choose not to allow another person or event to control your thoughts. For the longest time I had tunnel vision and expected life to be a certain way. I studied my failures until I lost sight of my successes. I surrendered my dreams to feel a sense of comfort. I crafted limiting beliefs and shielded myself from love and happiness by refusing to put myself out there. And as I did all of this, I sat back and wondered why life was so miserable. Obviously, I was very lost. I began to turn things around about a decade ago when my stubborn habits led me into a chaotic argument with Angel. As we both stared at each other through tears, she said, “Marc, you are the enemy—your enemy. It’s your choices. I can’t sympathize any longer. You can choose differently if you want to, but you have to want to. Please, want to!” And after some extensive soul-searching, lots of reading, a little sabbatical, and continuous support from a loving wife and a few close friends, I learned to choose differently and eventually found myself again. I tell you this because I know you struggle with similar inner demons—occasionally we all do. Sometimes our thoughts and routine choices are our biggest enemies. Which is why I want to remind you to beware of… Nothing in life is constant. There is neither absolute happiness nor absolute sadness. There are only the changes in our moods that continuously oscillate between these two extremes. At any given moment we are comparing how we currently feel to how we felt at another time—comparing one level of our contentment to another. In this way, those of us who have felt great sadness are best able to feel heightened feelings of happiness after we emotionally heal. In other words, happiness and sadness need each other. One reinforces the other. Humans must know misery to identify times of elation. The key is to focus on the good. May you live each moment of your life consciously, and realize that all the happiness you seek is present if you are prepared to notice it. If you are willing to appreciate that this moment is far better than it could have been, you will enjoy it more for what it truly is. (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the Happiness and Growth chapters of the NEW edition of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Imagine being enrolled in five college classes in which you achieved one A, two B’s and two C’s. Would you concentrate on the A or the C’s? Would you berate yourself for falling short in the C classes? Or would you capitalize on your obvious interest and aptitude in the subject matter of the A class? I hope you realize the value of the latter. Every morning when you wake up, think of three things that are going well in your life at the moment. As you fall asleep every night, fill your mind with an appreciation for all the small things that went well during the day. Examine your successes. Give the power of your thinking to the positive influences in your life, and they will grow stronger and more influential every day. Remind yourself often of what works well and why, and you’ll naturally find ways to make lots of other things work well too. The most efficient way to enjoy more success in life is not to obsess yourself with what hasn’t worked in the past, but instead to extend and expand upon the success you already know. The most common and destructive addiction in the world is the draw of comfort. Why pursue growth when you already have 400 television channels and a recliner? Just pass the chip dip and lose yourself in a trance. WRONG! That’s not living—that’s existing. Living is about learning and growing through excitement and discomfort. Life is filled with questions, many of which don’t have an obvious or immediate answer. It’s your willingness to ask these questions, and your courage to march confidently into the unknown in search of the answers, that gives life it’s meaning. In the end, you can spend your life feeling sorry for yourself, cowering in the comfort of your routines, wondering why there are so many problems out in the real world, or you can be thankful that you are strong enough to endure them. It just depends on your mindset. The obvious first step, though, is convincing yourself to step out of your comfort zone. You do not suffer from your beliefs. You suffer from your disbeliefs. If you have no hope inside of you, it’s not because there is no hope, it’s because you don’t believe there is. Since the mind drives the body, it’s the way you think that eventually makes the dreams you dream possible or impossible. Your reality is simply a reflection of your thoughts and the way you routinely contemplate what you know to be true. All too often you literally do not know any better than good enough. Sometimes you have to try to do what you think you can’t do, so you realize that you actually CAN. It all starts on the inside. You control your thoughts. The only person who can hold you down is YOU. Love is vulnerability. Happiness is vulnerability. The risk of being vulnerable is the price of opening yourself to beauty and opportunity. Being vulnerable is not about showing the parts of you that are polished; it’s about revealing the unpolished parts you would rather keep hidden from the world. It’s about looking out into the world with an honest, open heart and saying, “This is me. Take me or leave me.” It’s hard to consciously choose vulnerability. Why? Because the stakes are high. If you reveal your authentic self, there is the possibility that you will be misunderstood, judged, or even rejected. The fear of these things is so powerful that you put on an armored mask to protect yourself. But, of course, this only perpetuates the pain you are trying to avoid. The truth is nothing worthwhile in this world is a safe bet. Since love and happiness are born out of your willingness to be vulnerable—to be open to something wonderful that could be taken away from you—when you hide from your vulnerability, you automatically hide from everything in life worth attaining. (Read Daring Greatly.) There’s this fantasy in your head about how you think things are supposed to be. This fantasy blinds you from reality and prevents you from appreciating the genuine goodness that exists in your life. The solution? Simple: Drop the needless expectations. Appreciate what is. Hope for the best, but expect less. You have to accept reality instead of fighting it. Don’t let what you expected to happen blind you from all the good things that are happening. When you stop expecting people and things to be perfectly the way you had imagined, you can enjoy them for who and what they truly are. Today, do your best to leverage the reminders above. The overarching goal is to gradually change your response to what you can’t control. To grow so strong on the inside that nothing on the outside can affect your inner wellness without your conscious permission. And, please leave Angel and me a comment below and let us know what you think of this post. Your feedback is important to us. 🙂 (Finally, if you haven’t done so already, be sure to sign-up for our free newsletter to receive new articles like this in your inbox each week.) "
"7 Hard Things You Should Start Doing for Others|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/8-hard-things-for-others.jpg?resize=500%2C334&ssl=1| Don’t just rant online for a better world. Love your family. Be a good neighbor. Practice kindness. Build bridges. Embody what you preach. Today. And always. About a decade ago, at one o’clock in the morning, my grandpa who was suffering from Alzheimer’s got up, got into my car and drove off. Angel and I contacted the police, but before they could find him, two college kids pulled into our driveway with my grandpa. One was driving him in my car and the other was following in their car. They said they overheard him crying about being lost at an empty gas station 10 miles away. My grandpa couldn’t remember our address, but gave the kids his first and last name. They looked him up online, found our address, and drove him home. I was randomly reflecting on that incident today while sitting near the edge of a beautiful ocean-side cliff in San Diego. As I stared off into the distance, the sudden awareness of footsteps behind me startled me. I turned around to see a young lady who was almost in tears slowly walking to where I was sitting. I jumped up, walked up to her and asked, “What’s wrong?” She told me she was deathly afraid of heights, but was worried about my safety and wanted to get over her fear because she needed to make sure I was okay. “You were sitting so close to the edge, and with a such despondent expression,” she said. “My heart told me I needed to check on you—to make sure you were in a healthy state of mind.” Her name is Kate, and her braveness and kindness truly warmed my heart. I’ve spent the rest of the day thinking about what an extraordinary person Kate is, and about those amazing college kids who helped my grandpa, and about what it means to be a kind and giving person. As Kate and those kids found out, being kind isn’t always easy. Sometimes you have to go the extra mile, or face your biggest fears, or stand up against your own negative tendencies to make a positive difference in someone else’s life. Let this be your wake-up call today. It’s time to start doing the hard things—the right things—for others… The closest thing to being cared for is to care for others. We are all in this together and we should treat each other as such. The very demons that torment each of us, torment others all over the world. It is our challenges and troubles that connect us at the deepest level. If you think about the people who have had the greatest positive effect on your life—the ones who truly made a difference—you will likely realize that they aren’t the ones that tried to give you all the answers or solve all your problems. They’re the ones who sat silently with you when you needed a moment to think, who lent you a shoulder when you needed to cry, and who tolerated not having all the answers, but stood beside you anyway. Be this person for those around you every chance you get. There is greatness and beauty in making time, especially when it’s inconvenient, for the sake of someone nearby. You don’t have to tell people that you care, just show them. In your relationships and interactions with others, nothing you can give is more appreciated than your sincere, focused attention. Being with someone, listening without a clock and without anticipation of results is the ultimate compliment. It is indeed the most valued gesture you can make to another human being. When we pay attention to each other we breathe new life into each other. With frequent attention and affection our relationships flourish, and we as individuals grow wiser and stronger. We help heal each other’s wounds and support each other’s growth. So give someone the gift of YOU—your time, undivided attention and kindness. That’s better than any other gift, it won’t break or get lost, and will always be remembered. (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Relationships” chapter of the NEW edition of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Life’s greatest privilege is to become who you truly are. You have to dare to be yourself, one hundred percent, however anxious or odd that self may prove to be. The people who support you in doing so are extraordinary. Appreciate these people and their kindness, and pay it forward when you’re able. Never bully someone into silence. Never victimize others for being different. Accept no one’s close-minded definition of another person. Let people define themselves. You have the ability to show people how awesome they are, just the way they are. So act on this ability without hesitation; and don’t forget to show yourself the same courtesy. The mind is like a parachute; it doesn’t work when it’s closed. It’s okay to disagree with the thoughts or opinions expressed by others. But that doesn’t give you the right to immediately reject any sense they might make. Nor does it give you a right to accuse someone of poorly expressing their beliefs just because you don’t like what they are thinking and saying. Learn to recognize the beauty of different ideas and perspectives, even if it means overcoming your pride and opening your mind beyond what is comfortable. Healthy relationships and human interactions are not a power struggle. Be willing to be wrong, while simultaneously exploring your truth. A brave, extraordinary soul recognizes the strength of others. Give genuine praise whenever possible. Doing so is a mighty act of service. Start noticing what you like about others and speak up. Having an appreciation for how amazing the people around you are is extremely rewarding. It’s an investment in them that doesn’t cost you a thing, and the returns can be astounding. Not only will they feel empowered, but also what goes around comes around, and sooner or later the people you’re cheering for will start cheering for you too. Also, be sure to follow this rule: “Praise in public, penalize in private.” Never publicly ridicule someone when you have the option not to. If you don’t understand someone, ask questions. If you don’t agree with them, tell them. But don’t judge them behind their back to everyone else. What others say and do is often based entirely on their own self-reflection. When someone who is angry and upset speaks to you, and you nevertheless remain very present and continue to treat them with kindness and respect, you place yourself in a position of great power. You become a means for the situation to be graciously diffused and healed. A spiritual teacher once told me, “When somebody backs themselves into a corner, look the other way until they get themselves out; and then act as though it never happened.” Allowing people to save face in this way, and not reminding them of what they already know is not their most intelligent behavior, is an act of great kindness. This is possible when we realize that people behave in such ways because they are in a place of great suffering. People react to their own thoughts and feelings and their behavior often has nothing directly to do with you. (Read Buddha’s Brain.) Be gentle and compassionate with those around you. Mother Nature opens millions of flowers every day without forcing the buds. Let this be a reminder not to be forceful with those around you, but to simply give them enough light and love, and an opportunity to grow naturally. Ultimately, how far you go in life depends on your willingness to be helpful to the young, respectful to the aged, tender with the hurt, supportive of the striving, and tolerant of those who are weaker or stronger than the majority. Because we wear many hats throughout the course of our lives, and at some point in your life you will realize you have been all of these people. (Note: Angel and I take a deep dive into the aforementioned points with our students in the Relationships module of the Getting Back to Happy Course & Coaching.) The bottom line is that it’s time to be less impressed by your own money, titles, degrees, and looks. And it’s time to be more impressed by your own generosity, integrity, humility, and kindness towards others. Don’t you agree? Please leave us a comment below and share your thoughts.

NO quick fixes. NO blaming others. NO “I’ll do it tomorrows.” NO MORE EXCUSES! The mind is a wonderful thing. It’s also an excuse-making machine that frequently tries to convince us not to take actions we know are good for us. And this prevents many positive changes from taking place in our lives. I’ve had to learn to watch these excuses very carefully in order to make the positive changes I’ve made in my life: a healthier diet, regular exercise, meditation, more sleep, daily writing, better planning, less procrastination, more focus, etc. If I hadn’t learned about these excuses, and how to suppress them, I would never have succeeded in making these positive changes. In fact, until I knew better, I had failed countless times when I was young because my mind’s deceptive tendencies used to get the best of me. So why does the mind mess with us and make irrational excuses? Because the mind wants comfort, that’s why. It’s afraid of discomfort, pressure and change. The mind is absorbed in its comfort zone, and anytime we try to stretch that zone too far, for too long, the mind tries desperately to get back to ground zero at any cost—including sacrificing our long-term health, happiness and success. So let’s expose 10 of the cowardly mind’s most damaging excuses once and for all… It seems too difficult at first, so you think you can’t stick to the positive change you’re making. You don’t believe in yourself enough to take another step. This is a common excuse that can be countered by looking at the fact that other people no more capable than you have done it. For example, my 60-year-old next-door neighbor ran a marathon a little before I started training for my first marathon, and so I told myself, “If she can do it, so can I!” And I was right. Truth be told, the only person who can tell you “I can’t” is you. If you hear those words echoing in the back of your mind, tune them out. Realize that your doubts and your faith have something in common—they both ask you to believe in something you can’t see. You simply have to decide which one you want to believe. Just because someone else can, doesn’t mean you can, right? You look for reasons they can do it but you can’t—maybe he’s an internet entrepreneur or freelance writer because he has no kids. Maybe she’s way fitter than I am, so she can run a marathon. Maybe she doesn’t have all the work and family obligations I have, or has a supportive spouse, or doesn’t have bad knees. OK, fine, it’s easy to find excuses: but look at all the other people who also have considerable obstacles and have done it anyway. Marc and I have a family, and have dealt with significant loss in our lives, and still managed to succeed on many fronts. And just as we’ve turned things around for ourselves, we know hundreds of other people who’ve done the same. Through a decade of life coaching, we’ve witnessed people reinventing themselves at all ages – 48-year olds starting families, 57-year-olds graduating from college for the first time, 71-year-olds starting successful businesses, and so forth. And stories abound of people with disabilities or illnesses who overcame their obstacles to achieve great things. Your obstacles can be overcome. Have you ever met a happy, successful person who regularly avoids responsibility, blames and points fingers and makes excuses for their unsatisfying life? Me either. The truth is, you write your own destiny through the choices you make every day. You become what you repeatedly do. It is more important to know where you are going and why, than to get there quickly. In fact, the most important thing in life is knowing what the most important things in life are, and prioritizing them accordingly. Most of us spend too much time on urgent things and not enough time on important things. So do yourself a favor and implement these three action steps every time you’re building or sorting your to-do list: Fill in the blank: I need my wine, my cheese, my sweets, my TV shows, my ten hours of sleep, my big house, my fancy wardrobe, etc. These are luxuries we convince ourselves we can’t live without, so we can justify not making positive changes like eating healthier or exercising daily or saving money or simplifying our lives or building a profitable side hustle. And like I said, I’m not immune either—in the past I’ve made these excuses myself, but they all turned out to be lies. I didn’t need any of these things in my life, and believing that I did was only getting in the way of the positive changes I was capable of creating for myself. Sure, I agree that life should be enjoyed (as most people would) but the problem is that the idea that life should ALWAYS be easy and enjoyable is used to justify all kinds of lazy behavior. Might as well sit on the couch and scarf down those cookies, because hey, life is meant to be enjoyed, right? Nope. You can do without junk food and still enjoy life. You can exercise and enjoy it. You can give up a lot of comfort in your life and not lose a thing. In fact, the path of least resistance is often the path of least reward. You need to do hard things. There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. As Einstein once said, “Genius is 1% talent and 99% percent hard work.” You must run to be a runner. You must write to be a writer. You must actively work on a business venture to learn how to run a successful business. There is no substitute for doing the work. So meditate on this every day: “I will do the work. It won’t be easy. It will be worth it!” We all deserve a tasty treat, or a day off. I’m not saying you shouldn’t give yourself a reward or break when one is deserved. But if you make this rationalization a primary rule for living, you’ll always be on a break. You’ll always be giving yourself rewards, and never adhering to the original plan. Here’s what I do instead: I see sticking to my plan as the reward itself. I see reaching my goals as a gift I give myself. Going on a run isn’t the thing I have to get through to get a reward—the run is the reward. Sure, you can always do it later… but your later self will feel the same exact way. Think about it: Why should your later self be more disciplined than your present self? There’s no reason. In fact, because you’re allowing yourself to slack off now, you’re building a habit of procrastination and actually making it less likely that your later self will be more disciplined. So today, stop making excuses for why you can’t get it done and start focusing on all the reasons why you must make it happen. Stop talking about what you have done or what you are going to do. Just do it and let your actions speak for themselves. Most great things in life don’t happen by chance, they happen by choice. You never know what’s possible until you risk finding out. In the long run, there is only one thing that makes your dreams and goals completely impossible to achieve: Your lack of action today. (Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Productivity” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) This lie is so tempting, because it’s somewhat true: one time won’t hurt. Assuming, of course, that it really is only one time. One scoop of ice cream, one missed workout, one time procrastinating instead of working, etc. Unfortunately, it’s never just one time. One time means your brain now knows it can get away with this excuse next time too, and the next “one time” leads to another, until you’ve completely fallen off the wagon. Make a pact with yourself: never believe the “one time” lie. If you’re going to allow yourself a scoop of ice cream, decide this beforehand and build it into your plan—“I will allow myself a single serving of sweets once every weekend” and stick to your plan, rather than deciding on the fly when your conscience is weak. You’re only human. If you break down, it’s fine. Just don’t stay down. Rest, and then pick yourself up so you can go to where you’d rather be. Mistakes make us wiser. Failures help us grow. Hope keeps us going. And love is the reason we’re alive. Keep learning, loving and living. As Winston Churchill once said, “Success is never final, failure is never fatal. It is courage to continue that counts.” Nothing could be closer to the truth. Persistence is the mother of all productive effort. Failures, small and large, happen every day to the best of us. The strongest, most productive people aren’t the people who always succeed, but the ones who don’t give up when they lose. In the heat of the moment when you feel like quitting, think about how far you have come and why you started in the first place. Oftentimes you’re a lot closer to making a breakthrough than you think. Some people give up their efforts when they have almost reached their goal, while others conquer their goals by exerting, up until the very last possible second, more vigorous efforts than ever before. Bottom line: Once you learn to quit, it becomes a habit. Make some necessary adjustments, and KEEP GOING! (Read The Success Principles.) Change is constant, but growth is optional. Remain stuck or learn and grow. Where you end up is dependent on your daily attitude and response. And it’s never too late to change your attitude about something you can’t change. Just decide to make the best of it. No excuses. No regrets. Honestly, nothing is too late until your tired heart stops beating. If you’re reading this right now, congratulations, you are alive, which means it’s not too late for you. Things can change if you want them to at any age. Right now you can choose differently and make something new happen. Your future is immediate. Grab on to it with both hands and keep on moving on. When you come up on a roadblock and are faced with the choice of sitting down and doing nothing or doing something to make further progress, choose the latter. Think, work, and climb if you have to. Move your life forward. Today! (Note: Marc and I take a deep dive into all of the aforementioned points with our students in the Getting Back to Happy Course & Coaching.)

This morning, after back surgery nearly a year ago, one of my neighborhood friends finally took his first few unassisted steps. His doctor says he should be back on his feet full-time in about two months; he just needs to build up the muscle in his legs again. When I asked my friend what he’s looking forward to most about being back on his feet, he said, “Long walks with my wife.” His response resonated deeply with me. It’s such a strong reminder that the simple things are often the most important, and that we sometimes let stifling thoughts and ineffective habits get in our way of being happy and productive. Which is why it’s time to focus less on… Focus on the activities and people that make you happy, and filter out the avoidable opposites. Truth be told, we often make our lives complicated when it’s really quite simple: Find what it is that makes you happy and spend more time doing it. Find who it is that makes you smile and spend more time with them. Living your dream is really just a matter of proper lifestyle alignment. It’s about being true to yourself, and realizing that where you are at any given moment is exactly where you want to be. Thus, happiness and success in life is simply the gratifying combination of liking yourself, liking what you do, and liking who you do it with. When other people treat you poorly, keep being you. Don’t ever let someone else’s bitterness change the person you are. Don’t let the silly little dramas of each day get you down either. Stay positive when negativity surrounds you. Keep calm and carry on. It takes one positive thought to overpower an entire array of negative thoughts. People who are able to find the one positive point in negative situations are the ones who never give up. Always be kinder than necessary. What goes around comes around. No one has ever made themselves strong by showing how small someone else is. Whatever can be done, can be done more effectively when you add kindness. Whatever words are spoken, will always be more compelling when expressed with kindness. The kind deeds you exert in just one moment can have a positive impact that lasts a lifetime. Your days will be brighter and your years fuller when you add kindness to your purpose. Choose to be kind every day, and you’re truly choosing to live in a better world. Accept your humanness. You can stop pretending. It feels good to own up to stuff… to admit that you’re human—a work in progress—a beautiful mess. Wanting to be someone or something else is a waste of your beauty. You’re fine. If you feel like you aren’t, you’re blowing things out of proportion. Having a little anxiety is fine. Being a little fearful is fine. Your secrets are fine. You’re a good person. You’re intelligent. You’re fine just the way you are. (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” chapter of the NEW edition of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Your ideas and choices don’t have to be on everyone’s “approved” list. Regardless of the opinions of others, at the end of the day the only reflection staring back at you in the mirror is your own. Make sure you’re proud of who that person is. Approach others with the belief that you’re a good person, whether they respond positively or not. It’s normal to want people to like you, but it becomes a self-imposed burden when too much of your behavior is explicitly designed to constantly reassure you of their approval. Whatever you’re waiting for—peace of mind, contentment, grace, an inner awareness of abundance—it will surely come to you, but only when you’re ready to receive it with an open and grateful heart. So be as grateful as possible, for small things, not just for big things—for the simple act of breathing, the time together, the conversations, etc. Every moment counts. Every second matters. Whatever is given is a gift. Make the most of it. Focus on the resources you do have access to. It all begins and ends in your mind. What you give power to has power over you, if you allow it. Too many of us are hung up on what we don’t have, can’t have, or won’t ever have. We spend too much energy being down, when we could use that same energy—if not less of it—doing, or at least trying to do, some of the things we really want to do. So focus on the opportunities you DO have and exploit the resources you DO have access to. Too many people buy things they don’t need with money they don’t have to impress people they don’t know. Don’t be one of them. Stop buying stuff on impulse! Avoid the mall! The mall is not a source of entertainment. It’s a source of personal debt. There’s no reason to tease yourself by staring at a bunch of brand new junk you don’t need. And as you know, the novelty of a new purchase wears thin long before the credit card bill arrives. So as I’ve said before, live a comfortable life, not a wasteful one. Do not spend to entertain yourself or impress others. Do not fool yourself into thinking wealth is measured in material objects. Manage your money wisely so your money does not manage you. Remember, the way you’ve always done it isn’t the only way. It’s unlikely that one of the things you’ll regret when you’re 80 is not having consumed enough beer in your 20s, or not having bought enough $9 lattes in your 30s, or not having frequented the same chain restaurants for your entire 40s, etc. But the regret of missing out on opportunities is a real, toxic feeling. You’ve figured out drinking and going out. You’ve had enough lattes. You know what the hamburger at Applebee’s tastes like. It’s time to figure something else out. Every corner you turn or street you walk down has a new experience waiting for you. You just have to see the opportunity and be adventurous enough to run with it. Incessant busyness is often a sign of ineffectiveness and laziness. Because it’s easy to be busy—just partake in a bunch of random activities that drains all your time. Doing so justifies never having enough time to clean, cook for yourself, go out with friends, meet new people, etc. Right? Wrong. Don’t just get things done; get the right things done. Results are always more important than the time it takes to achieve them. You have to take risks. You will only realize the full potential of your life when you allow the unexpected to happen. Living itself is risky business. Every decision, every interaction, every step, every time you get out of bed in the morning, you take a risk. To truly live is to know you’re getting up and taking that risk. To not get out of bed, clutching to illusions of safety, is to die slowly without ever having truly lived. Be a little risky and realize the full potential of your life. A fear of being defeated is what warrants your defeat. A fear of not being good enough is what guarantees that you never will be. If you never pick up that keyboard, or pencil, or paintbrush, or whatever instrument you use to craft your work, because you’re afraid that someone else might do it better than you, your prediction will automatically come true. Remember, defeat is not the worst of failures. Not having tried at all is as bad as it gets. And as far as failure itself is concerned, you’re not obligated to succeed or fail. You’re obligated to keep trying—to do the best you can do every day. That’s all. And you’re always good enough to do that. The ones who fall and get up are so much stronger than the ones who never fell. Often it’s the deepest pain that empowers human beings to rise and grow into their highest selves. The ones who win the race in the long run are usually not the quickest or slickest, but the ones who have endured the most. Life is about laughing and learning through good times and bad. It’s about growing through whatever comes your way and looking back with a smile. You’re stronger because of the hard times, wiser because of your mistakes, and happier because you have known sadness. The same is true for everyone else. So stay strong. Even when it feels like everything is falling apart, you can either let it define you, destroy you, or let it strengthen you. Things change for the better. Just believe and roll with it. It won’t always be easy, but it will be worth it in the end. When you finally let go of the past and what did or didn’t happen, something better comes along. Oftentimes what you’re looking for comes when you’re not looking at all. The feeling you get from taking the first step is far better than the feeling you get from sitting around thinking about it. So get up and get moving. Take the first step this year—just one small step forward. The greatest miracle of your success will not be that you finished, it will be that you had the courage to begin. The future starts TODAY, not tomorrow. (Note: Angel and I customize and implement all of the aforementioned points with our students in the Getting Back to Happy Course & Coaching.)

At times we all feel less than adequate. We feel like we’re running in place, struggling to make even the slightest bit of progress. And while this is a perfectly normal feeling, you have to ultimately break free from it and see yourself and your life in a more positive light. The key is to pay attention to the small things. Just because you’re not where you want to be, doesn’t mean you’re a failure. In fact, quite the opposite is true. To be truly happy and successful today doesn’t mean you don’t desire more in the future, it means you are sincerely thankful for what you have already accomplished and patient for everything yet to come. Train your mind to see the good side of what’s in front of you. Life is a series of thousands of tiny miracles. Notice them. Notice again and again how fortunate you are. The evidence is all around you right now, and it’s beautiful, and well worth gathering into your awareness. Every morning when you wake up, think of three things that are going well in your life at the moment. As you fall asleep every night, fill your mind with an appreciation for all the small things that went well during the day. Examine your daily successes. Give the power of your thinking to the positive influences in your life, and they will grow stronger and more influential every day. Remind yourself of what works well and why, and you’ll naturally find ways to make lots of other things work well too. The most efficient way to enjoy more success in life is not to obsess yourself with what hasn’t worked, but instead to extend and expand upon the success you already know. Here are some much-needed reminders—sixteen good reasons you’re already succeeding in life: If you can’t check-off every point from this list, no big deal. This list is just a rough guideline. We all need our own time to travel our own distance, our own way. But keep in mind, the principle still applies: Success is not a skill; it’s a persistent attitude. It’s not a place you arrive at; it’s a process you live through. It’s what you do every day. It’s what you are doing now… You are succeeding in life. You just have to believe it.

"One Priceless Lesson We Often Forget About Love and Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/one-lesson-love-life.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| Jose’s wife, Maria, was born in a one-bedroom, stand-alone home on the outskirts of Playa del Carmen, Mexico.  It was a fine little home, but her father, Oscar, wanted a “real” house.  So, he worked two jobs—a 60-hour-a-week factory job, and then another 20 hours or so a week as a carpenter. Oscar saved 50% of his income for over a decade to build his family a four-bedroom house—like the ones in the better parts of town.  He put half his family’s savings in a local community bank, and he tucked the other half away in a safe he kept hidden on their property. On the morning Oscar planned to break ground on his family’s new house, the local community bank shuttered its doors, just hours after law enforcement declared the bank was running an illegal (and uninsured) Ponzi scheme.  90% of the deposits Oscar made were lost.  Then, the very next day, their little home was robbed at gunpoint.  In exchange for his family’s safety, Oscar offered the rest of the money he had hidden in the safe. In the short window of 36 hours, the family lost the vast majority of their savings from years of hard work.  That night, for the first time, Maria’s mother, Olga, watched Oscar cry.  She approached Oscar with their infant daughter cradled and rocking in her arms, and said, “It’s just money.  And it’s just a house.  We have so much more than that.  We have a truly loving home.” Oscar looked at Olga, dried his eyes, and nodded his head in agreement.  He spent the rest of the night with his baby daughter, holding her tight to his chest, reminding himself that he might not be able to give his family the house he dreamed of, but he could continue to give them a truly loving home. And for the nine years that followed, Maria grew up in that small, loving, one-bedroom home.  After the first year, a sister, Andrea, joined her.  After the third year, a brother, Roberto, joined too.  The memories they share of that time are truly heartwarming. For example, every day of Maria’s early grade school years, she remembers her father coming home from work just before dinner, giving her and her siblings individual hugs and kisses, and then asking them two questions: “Are you loved?  Do you have love in your heart?”  All three children would nod their heads, smiling.  Then he’d gather them all up in a big group hug and call out, “Me too!  We are blessed!  We have everything we need!” Even though Oscar sincerely believed what he said to his children, he was still pursuing his dream of building a larger and more comfortable house for his family.  And nine years after losing all of their savings, Oscar had once again saved enough money to begin building that new house 20 feet behind their little one-bedroom home.  He started with framing out the foundation of the kitchen that Maria’s mother had always quietly dreamed of. One cement block at a time, paycheck by paycheck, Oscar slowly but steadily built the house he’d come so close to building nearly a decade beforehand.  First the kitchen, a large family room, and two bathrooms.  Then a master bedroom, bedrooms for each of the children, and a nice covered front patio. In 2002, when Jose met Maria, and started falling in love with her, Oscar was still building that house.  Soon thereafter, he put the last few finishing touches on it.  The entire family celebrated for weeks on end.  And nowadays, Oscar and Olga still celebrate holidays and special occasions at the house, with all three of their children, and their children’s families, several times a year. But this story’s priceless lesson has nothing to do with that house. The first day Jose met Maria’s family, he noticed how sincerely loving and happy the whole family was.  He praised Oscar for the beautiful family he had, and asked him what the secret was.  Oscar spent hours sharing interesting, heartfelt stories about why his family was the luckiest one in the world.  But he never shared all the details about how their house was built. In fact, after years of knowing Maria and her family, traveling with them, and even living with them for a short time, no one ever thought to tell Jose about how their family’s house came to be.  Jose asked questions about the construction on a few occasions.  And he received replies about the construction. It wasn’t until after Jose and Maria got married and closed on their own first house—in Miami, Florida—that Oscar took Jose for a long walk.  He asked Jose about the details, and Jose excitedly shared information about their new neighborhood and the house.  Oscar listened intently, smiled, and then, finally, he shared the story you’ve just read about. “My daughter does not need a house,” Oscar concluded.  “She needs a truly loving home.  And when you fill that home with children, your children will need exactly the same.  If you provide that, no matter how big or small your actual house is, your children will always want to come home to you.  The rest is just a bonus.” . . . I know all of this because Jose is one of my best friends.  And just this morning, over coffee, he asked me what I was going to write about today.  When I told him I hadn’t yet decided, he smirked and said, “I have a story for you.”  And then he proceeded to tell me the story I’ve just told you.

How to Find the Perfect Man (or Woman)|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/how-to-find-perfect-man.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| This morning, over coffee, one of my good friends spilled her guts to me about all of her failed attempts to find the perfect man.  Although her story is about her unique personal experiences, I couldn’t help but feel like I had heard the same story told by others in completely different circumstances a hundred times before. It’s a heartbreaking tale about the endless quest for perfection that so many of us are on… Once upon a time, an intelligent, attractive, self-sufficient woman in her mid-thirties decided she wanted to settle down and find a husband.  So she journeyed out into the world to search for the perfect man. She met him in New York City at a bar in a fancy hotel lobby.  He was handsome and well-spoken.  In fact, she had a hard time keeping her eyes off of him.  He intrigued her.  It was the curves of his cheek bones, the confidence in his voice, and the comfort of his warm, steady hands.  But after only a short time, she broke things off.  “We just didn’t share the same religious views,” she said.  So she continued on her journey. She met him again in Austin a few months later.  This time, he was an entrepreneur who owned a small, successful record label that assisted local musicians with booking gigs and promoting their music.  And she learned, during an unforgettable night, that not only did they share the same religious views, but he could also make her laugh for hours on end.  “But I just wasn’t that physically attracted to him,” she said.  So she continued on her journey. She met him again in Miami at a beachside café.  He was a sports medicine doctor for the Miami Dolphins, but he easily could have been an underwear model for Calvin Klein.  For a little while, she was certain he was the one!  And all of her friends loved him too.  “He’s the perfect catch,” they told her.  “But we didn’t hang in the same social circles, and his high-profile job consumed way too much of his time and attention,” she said.  So she cut things off and continued on her journey. Finally, at a corporate business conference in San Diego, she met the perfect man.  He possessed every quality she had been searching for.  Intelligent, handsome, spiritual, similar social circles, and a strong emotional and physical connection—absolutely perfect!  She was ready to spend the rest of her life with him.  “But unfortunately, he was looking for the ‘perfect’ woman,” she said. As human beings, we often chase hypothetical, static states of perfection.  We do so when we are searching for the perfect house, job, friend, or lover. The problem, of course, is that perfection doesn’t exist in a static state.  Because life is a continual journey, constantly evolving and changing.  What is here today is not exactly the same tomorrow. That perfect house, job, friend, or lover will eventually fade to a state of imperfection.  Thus, the closest we can get to perfection is the experience itself—the snapshot of a single moment or vision held forever in our minds—never evolving, never growing.  And that’s not really what we want.  We want something real!  And when it’s real, it won’t ever be perfect.  But if we’re willing to work at it and open up, it could be everything we’ve ever hoped for. The truth is, when it comes to finding the “perfect man” or “perfect woman” or “perfect relationship,” the journey starts with letting the fantasy of “perfect” GO!  In the real world, you don’t love and appreciate someone because they’re perfect, you love and appreciate them in spite of the fact that they are not.  Likewise, your goal shouldn’t be to create a perfect life, but to live an imperfect life in radical amazement. And when an intimate relationship gets difficult, it’s not an immediate sign that you’re doing it wrong.  Intimate relationships are intricate, and are often toughest when you’re doing them right—when you’re dedicating time, having the hard conversations, compromising, and making daily sacrifices.  Resisting the tough moments—the real moments—and seeing them as immediate evidence that something is wrong, or that you’re with the wrong person, only exacerbates the difficulties.  By contrast, viewing difficulties in a relationship as normal and necessary will give you and your partner the best chance to thrive together in the long run. Again, there is no “perfect.”  To say that one waits a lifetime for their perfect soulmate to come around is an absolute paradox.  People eventually get tired of waiting, so they take a chance on someone, and by the powers of love, compromise and commitment they become soulmates, which takes nearly a lifetime to perfect. This concept truly relates to almost everything in life too.  With a little patience and an open mind, over time, I bet that imperfect house evolves into a comfortable home.  That imperfect job evolves into a rewarding career.  That imperfect friend evolves into a steady shoulder to lean on.  And… that imperfect man or woman evolves into a “perfect” lifelong companion.

The Mighty Art of Being More Resourceful|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/being-more-resourceful.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| Accept all of yourself, your strengths, your weaknesses, your surroundings, your present truths, and know what tools you have to fulfill your purpose.  Last weekend Angel and I attended a show at a local comedy club.  During the last skit of the night, the comedian on stage delivered a fairly humorous rant on the age-old dispute of whether the pen is mightier than the sword.  “Some people think too much,” he said as he pulled out an imaginary sword from an imaginary holster.  “If you’re really dumb enough to think the pen is mightier than the sword, go ahead and arm yourself with a pen and I’ll take my chances with this sword… then we’ll see who’s left standing in ten seconds.” His antics were hilarious, so naturally I chuckled.  All of a sudden, he pointed directly at me in the third row and said, “Hey young man, do you think I’m a funny guy?  You look like a pen-pushing, desk jockey!  Get out your pen!  Wanna fight?” I was a bit startled.  This was the first time I’d ever been called out and put on the spot in front of a large audience at a comedy club.  The audience laughed and then silence swept over the auditorium.  Everyone waited for me to either cower in my chair or stand up to the challenge.  I stood up and spotlights shined down on me. “Actually funny man, yes I do have a pen,” I said, pulling a fountain pen from my jeans pocket and holding it up for all to see.  “However, I don’t intend to physically fight you with this pen.  Instead, I’ll use the pen to sign a fat check that entitles me to a bazooka which I’ll use to blow your kinda-funny rear end right off that stage.” The audience roared.  The comedian groaned and said, “You little punk, I’ll use my sword and my cat-like reflexes to cut you, your check, and that pretty girl next to you in half before you can even blink an eye!”  He looked at Angel who was sitting next to me and gave her a dirty wink. The audience laughed again.  I smirked and waved my empty hand around in the air noting that the comedian was, in fact, waving an imaginary sword at me.  “I feel quite certain that your sword is incapable of doing any damage to anyone or anything,” I said. Another short round of laughter escaped from the audience and I sat back down.  The comedian made a few more foolish comments and moved on with the remainder of his routine.  But I don’t really recall anything else he said or did.  I started thinking about the ease with which so many of us use rhetoric to mislead and deceive each other, and the resourcefulness we must tap into to truly get ahead in this world. There is a time and place for every tool.  Resourcefulness is knowing how to use each one of them, and when to use one over another. In the hands of a poetic pioneer laying the groundwork for positive change, the pen is mightier than the sword because it can be used to create literary masterpieces capable of motivating an army of fellow citizens to join the revolution.  In the hands of a foot soldier at the forefront of a battlefield, the sword is mightier than the pen because the soldier can use the sword to defend himself from imminent physical danger. Different people in different situations require different tools.  Any object can be mightier than another if it is used as a tool in the proper context.  A ply of soft tissue is mightier than a sword when you have a runny noise.  A glass of water and an apple are mightier than a pen when what’s needed is hydration and nourishment. The mightiest and most resourceful people, I believe, are those who know when to use the sword, and when to use the tissue.  They drink water when they’re thirsty and eat apples when they’re hungry.  They use a pen and paper (or a laptop computer) when then want to inspire others.  And, I suppose, they invoke powerful, imaginary bazookas when they get called out and put on the spot in comedy clubs.

Please leave a comment below and let me know what you think of this short essay. What resonated?  Any other ideas on being “mighty” or “resourceful?” I’d love to read YOUR thoughts.  🙂 And finally, if you haven’t done so already, be sure to sign-up for our free newsletter to receive new articles like this in your inbox each week. The Right Things Will Enter Your Life in Divine Timing|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/right-things-divine-timing.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| Most of what makes an experience so magical is that we are experiencing it at just the right moment. For the past several days I’ve had the melody to a song I’ve only heard once or twice repeating over and over in the back of my mind.  I didn’t even know the lyrics, but my mind kept spinning the tune anyway.  This morning I finally got around to looking up the lyrics, which in turn made me smile from ear to ear.  Because the song is perfectly suited to be the soundtrack to the past few wild weeks of my life. And I think that’s one of the most extraordinary functions of the human brain—it thinks for us even when we’re not consciously thinking.  How is this possible?  Well, the scientific answer—which I’m always curious about—is that our brain is a sophisticated parallel processing system capable of intuitively assessing and reacting to data that our conscious mind is never even aware of.  Tuning in and playing the running soundtrack of our lives is only a small example of our unconscious mind’s true potential. But despite my love for science, I don’t always want or need a scientific explanation for every little thing that happens in life.  When just the right thing happens at just the right moment, I simply want to believe that it was meant to be.  And even when complications arise, I want to believe that these complications are necessary evils—necessary because they force us to learn, adapt, and overcome.  Which is, I’ve learned, a big part of why we’re here in the first place. This afternoon I walked to a local park with my laptop to get some work done in the fresh air.  But after a short time, I was distracted by a young boy entertaining himself with nothing more than a wooden stick and his imagination.  And it brought me back to a simpler time.  You know… that time during our youth when we weren’t scared to dream without reason.  Just watching him was a soothing experience—a reminder that we, as adults, occasionally need to overcome the precincts of maturity and just let our imaginations run free.  It was a healthy distraction to say the least. Anyway, once I became conscious of the fact that I was getting no work done, I walked back home and sat down at my desk.  And I suddenly realized the melody that had been spinning in my head like a broken record had finally ceased.  Satisfied by this newfound mental silence, I got to work.  But before long, the absent melody was replaced by an overbearing, mouthwatering craving for chocolate cake.  And the weird thing is, I usually don’t eat sweets. After a few moments of contemplation, I decided that going to the grocery store to get a chocolate cake was a silly idea.  “You can eat chocolate cake later,” I thought to myself.  “But right now, you need to finish your work.”  So I did just that.  I got back to work. And I had almost completely forgotten about the chocolate cake, until Angel came home a couple hours later with a to-go box from a restaurant.  She placed it on my desk and said, “Hey sweetie, Janet and I went out to lunch this afternoon and my eyes were bigger than my stomach.  So I figured I’d bring the leftovers home for you to snack on.”  I opened the lid of the to-go box to find a quarter of a chicken wrap and a small slice of chocolate cake. I chuckled out loud.  Certainly there are plenty of valid explanations for this kind of synchronicity.  The most basic being that when we are tuned in to our feelings (a craving for example) and truly aware of our environment (actually opening the to-go box), these synchronous coincidences will seem to occur more often.  But as you know, even though I am fascinated by the science, I sometimes prefer to live in a more magical, philosophical world. So my explanation, which needs no substantiation from any source other than my own life experience, is that when we are tuned in to our lives—I mean truly tuned in both emotionally and intellectually to the circumstances and people around us—the melody to a common soundtrack is always playing.  And when we choose to listen to the music, and dance, every move we make happens in sync, and with… Think about the timing of your life for a moment. What if instead of pushing so hard to make things happen every second, you decided to let go a little?  What if instead of trying to always be in control, you sometimes surrendered control to something bigger than yourself?  What if instead of working so hard to figure out every last answer, you allowed yourself to be guided to solutions in perfect timing? Truly, the right things will often enter your life when you’re not even looking for them. They will enter your life at just the right time.  When you can function just fine without them for awhile.  When you have stopped needing to control everything.  When you are confident in yourself and your surroundings.  When you don’t need anything more to make you happy because you are at peace with where you are. The right things will enter your life when you are done running and hiding.  When you have taken a deep breath and made yourself available and open to the realities unfolding in front of you. The right things will enter your life when you stop rushing.  When you simply do your best, without trying to force what’s not yet supposed to happen.  When you allow your efforts and outcomes to unfold and evolve naturally. The right things will enter your life when you clear your mind and focus on the present.  When you let go of the baggage from yesterday that’s been clouding your vision of today’s blessings. Truth be told, when you are ready—truly ready—to experience the full breath of the moment you’re in, to taste that slice of chocolate cake when it arrives, that’s precisely when you’ll notice it sitting there in front of you. That’s the divine magic of life. Have faith in it.

One Simple Question You Should Ask Everyone You Meet|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/1-simple-question-for-everyone.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| “It doesn’t interest mewhat you do for a living.I want to knowwhat you ache forand if you dare to dreamof meeting your heart’s longing.” —The Invitation by Oriah I want to know what your story is… I don’t care what you do or what you own.  I just want to know who you are.  I want to know your uniqueness, the experiences you’ve had and the lessons you’ve learned.  I want to know your story. What is your story?  Everyone has one.  And no two stories are exactly the same. There are over seven billion people in this world and none are like you.  You are unique.  Your entire life journey including your upbringing, challenges, your hard learned lessons, your experiences, achievements and gifts, are all a series of footprints that have brought you to this very moment in time as you read these words. Every person you walk or drive past on the street has their own story.  Every person in front of you in line at the grocery store has their own story.  Every friend and work colleague in your life has their own story. The old man who lives alone up the street from me and wanders past my house each day, he has his own story.  The girl on the train sitting opposite me right now who has small tears welling up in her eyes, she has her own story.  The boy in the library who never stops laughing, even when his mother constantly asks him to be quiet, he has his own story too. Think about the millions of moments, the series of events that leads each person to cross your path.  Who are they really underneath that exterior?  Where did they come from?  What do they long for?  What makes them tick? Life is a tapestry of people weaving in and out of your life.  These people come into your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime.  Every one of them has something to offer and share with you.  Imagine treating every person you encounter, no matter how fleeting, as an intriguing story waiting to be told.  But the story can only be told if someone asks to hear it.  Will you ask?  That person you see standing before you, no matter who they are, young or old, rich or poor, rude or kind, is like a blockbuster movie ready to enthrall you.  But, first you have to buy a ticket. As I stood in a room full of people at a cocktail party once, I realized that every opening conversation was dominated by this question, “What do you do?” We seek to understand and define people by their doing in the world.  Yes, literally, and for some reason, we default to categorizing and ranking the entire worth of the people we meet based on what they “do.”  And I think that seriously dehumanizes us! Does what you do matter more than who you are?  Absolutely not!  What you do is only a small fraction of who you are as a human being. Do we care about each other enough, and are we interested enough in what we can learn from each other, to stop asking “What do you do?” and start asking “Who are you?  What is your story?” So, I’d love to ask you something, and I’m not asking a rhetorical question.  I really want to know… There’s only one way to normalize this “What is your story?” question in our society.  And that’s by starting to ask it, and by each of us individually being willing to answer it wholeheartedly, knowing that the person asking genuinely wants to know. Superficial chit chat about what we “do” and what we “own” doesn’t have to dominate our interactions with those closest to us or with complete strangers. I probably don’t know you at all.  You’re a complete stranger to me.  But I genuinely want to know your answers. Here’s my story .  I invite you to respond with your answers, supporting a movement to normalize caring more about who people are, than what they do and own.

This morning I was jogging along a nature path near my home when a woman I had just passed began screaming for help.  I turned around to see that her husband had fallen to the ground and appeared to be unconscious.  I ran over and checked his pulse.  He barely had one, and he was not breathing.  The woman called 911 on her mobile phone while I performed CPR on her husband.  Somehow, miraculously, I got him in a more stabilized state before the paramedics arrived.  And although I have no idea how this couple’s story will end, I’m optimistically hopeful. Now I’m sitting here reflecting on the whole incident, and especially on the words the woman repeated over and over through heavy tears as I was attending to her husband:  “It’s not his time.  Oh please, it’s not his time!” Her words keep echoing in my mind, reminding me that life is fragile and fleeting, and that I need to start allocating my time properly again.  Life has been extremely busy lately, and certain things have fallen by the wayside.  But enough is enough!  It’s time to revive and resume the positive daily rituals that best serve my well-being and my relationships.  And I hope YOU will join me. Think about it… (Note: Marc and I customize and implement all of the aforementioned points with our students in the Getting Back to Happy Course & Coaching.) Truth be told, the most important decision you will ever make is what you do with the time that is given to you.  Let every day be a part of a dream you can touch.  Let every day contain love you can feel.  Let every day be a great example of a life truly lived. Leave a comment below and let us know… What do you need to start making time for again?

I met a friend at a local coffee shop this morning.  She brought her work laptop along so she could show me some of her latest digital art designs.  As we chatted and scrolled through her artwork, the laptop suddenly started making an unhealthy buzzing noise, then the screen flickered on and off and finally cut off completely.  And as we both stared at one another in disbelief, the funky aroma of fried computer circuits filled our nostrils. I quickly grabbed the laptop off the counter to inspect it and the problem instantly revealed itself.  The bottom of the laptop was soaking wet and an empty, spilt water cup rested against the side of her purse just behind where the laptop was sitting.  In the midst of us chatting and shifting the laptop’s 17-inch screen back and forth, we somehow spilt a cup of water the barista had inadvertently placed on the counter behind the screen, which was out of our view. When life throws us nasty curveballs like this, it typically doesn’t make any sense to us, and our natural emotional reaction might be to get extremely upset and scream obscenities at the top of our lungs.  But how does this help our dilemma?  Obviously, it doesn’t. My friend threw her hands up in the air and, to my surprise, cracked a half smile. “That’s exactly why I backed up my files this morning, and why I have full insurance on my laptop,” she said. I was truly impressed with her response.  Many people I know have had meltdowns over much smaller inconveniences. How about YOU? How often do your responses, or emotional reactions, to life work against you? If you’re anything like the rest of us, the answer is likely: more often than you realize. So realize this now! When life doesn’t go as planned, it is what it is.  Accept it, learn from it and grow.  It doesn’t matter what you’ve done; what truly matters is what you do from here. Let my friend be your inspiration today.  Let her calm and collected response inspire you to make some positive shifts in various areas of your life.  It’s time to think better and live better! Which means it’s time to… Inner peace begins the moment you take a deep breath and choose not to allow another person or event to control your emotions. In other words, the greater part of your happiness or misery in the long run depends heavily on your attitude, not your circumstances.  If you’re stressed out by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your interpretation of it; and this is something you have the power to change.  It’s not easy, but it is entirely possible with practice. It all starts with establishing a baseline level of positive thinking in your daily life.  Make it a habit!  You need to train your mind to see the good in everything, even when things don’t go as planned.  Life is a series of thousands of tiny miracles.  Notice them.  Notice again and again how fortunate you are.  The evidence is all around you, and it’s beautiful, and well worth gathering into your awareness. And keep in mind that it takes roughly 66 days to form a new habit like this.  So for the next nine weeks, wake up every morning and look at the bright side of your life, and you will begin to rewire your brain. Be patient, but don’t just sit there expecting everything to be easy.  Good things don’t come to those who wait for the “easy” way.  And patience in life is not about waiting around; it’s the ability to keep a good attitude while working hard for what you believe in. Decades from now when you’re resting on your deathbed, you will not remember the days that were easy, you will cherish the moments when you rose above your difficulties and conquered goals of magnitude.  You will dream of the strength you found within yourself that allowed you to achieve what once seemed impossible. So don’t do what’s easy, do what you’re capable of today.  Astound yourself with your own resilience. And remember, one of the most important moments on any journey is the moment you finally find the courage to let go of what can’t be changed.  Because, when you are no longer able to change the obstacles in front of you, you are challenged to change yourself from within—to grow beyond the unchangeable obstacles.  And that changes absolutely everything. Every one of us is a perfectionist about something.  Learn to sense when your desire to make something perfect is preventing you from getting it done well.  Realize that the idea of perfection is not only unachievable, it can destroy your otherwise productive mindset.  It will keep you running in place, feeling insane for your entire life. If you feel like you’re running in place right now, take a break and reflect.  Think about the difference between diligent effort and perfectionism, and figure out what is triggering you.  Because whatever triggers you also reveals what you need to heal. Do your best to bring conscious awareness to what’s going through your worried mind when you’re not feeling good enough.  Why do you feel this way?  Who are you with this train of thought?  Who would you be, and what else would you see, if you removed it? Know when enough is enough!  Say it out loud if you must:  “Get lost perfectionism!  Without you I am brilliant!”  (Read The Gifts of Imperfection.) Isn’t it strange how life works?  You want something and you work for it and wait for it and work for it and wait for it, and you feel like it’s taking forever to arrive.  Then it happens and it’s over and all you want to do is curl back up in that moment before things changed. So, how can you avoid these feelings of loss and confusion? By being more present every step of the way. Pursue your goals and dreams while at the same time enjoying the journey of getting there.  Embrace the step you’re taking, even when you feel like you’ve lost your footing.  Sometimes the road gets bumpy.  Every step doesn’t have to be comfortable or perfectly placed. By letting go of what “should” happen or what “could” happen every step of the way, you free up your life to various little surprises and joys.  You may not lead the exact life you want, but you will lead a meaningful, miraculous existence, guaranteed.  Life is sometimes difficult, but it’s not a chore.  Make it an adventure.  Make it fun.  Make a choice to feel good about yourself, about your world, about your possibilities and the step you’re taking right now. Confident people use words with intention.  YOU can be one of them! Consider the difference between these two aspiring bloggers (two course students of ours) I recently spoke with: One says:  “Yes, I am a blogger.  You like meditation and yoga too?  Excellent!  We need to connect on this subject—check out my new mindfulness guide I just posted at…” And the other says:  “Well, I’m trying to blog but am not sure I’m doing it right (nervous giggle).  I wish I had started sooner… blah, blah.” Which one do you think gets the most views, comments and social shares on their blog posts? Bottom line:  If you’re trying to build something or become something, own it and speak like you mean it.  (Angel and I discuss this in detail in the Motivation chapter of our New York Times bestselling book, Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs.) You will end up sadly disappointed if you expect people will always do for you as you do for them.  Not everyone has the same heart as you. Be kind anyway! And remember, being kind to someone you dislike doesn’t mean you’re fake.  It means you’re mature enough to control your emotions.  So be kinder than necessary today.  What goes around comes around in the long run.  No one has ever made themselves strong by showing how small someone else is. Sometimes we put too much weight into trying to control every tiny aspect of our lives.  Switch gears, relax and ride the path that life takes you sometimes.  Try something new, be a bit daring, and explore your curiosity. Letting go a little lets you experience more of the unexpected.  And the greatest joys in life are often the unexpected surprises that you never intended to happen.  If you want to get really good at something—personally or professionally—let go of your expectations and replace them with the notion of endless playful exploration. We don’t stop dreaming and exploring because we grow old; we grow old because we stop dreaming and exploring.  So don’t stop!  😉 In light of everything you’ve just read, I have a challenge for you: Pick one of the points above and start consciously working on it.  Make doing so a positive daily ritual in your life. And do your best not to fall back into your old patterns.  Toxic habits and behaviors always try to sneak back in when you’re doing better.  Stay focused and positive about what’s to come, by being consistent with what you know in your heart is right. (Note: Angel and I customize and implement the aforementioned points with our students in the Getting Back to Happy Course & Coaching.) . . . And before you go, I’d love to hear from YOU in the comments section below. Which point above resonates with you the most?  (Which one do you need to STOP doing to yourself?)

Don’t Hesitate to Do These 8 Hard Things for Your Mental Health|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/8-hard-things-mental-health.jpg?resize=500%2C375&ssl=1| You need to do hard things to be happy in life.  Because the hard things ultimately build you up and change your life from the inside out. Daily stress is one of the primary causes of major mental and physical health problems in our lives: it can cause heart disease, anxiety, sleep deprivation, auto-immune disorders, weight problems, unhappiness, and even deep depression. But we’re busy – we all have places to be, things to do and people to see.  So, how do we alleviate stress and still get our work done right, without neglecting our loved ones and ourselves?  What can we realistically start doing today to nurture our mental health and overall wellness? I’m going to be brief about this, because time is of the essence.  There are eight simple (but not easy) things that need to be practiced.  A few mindset shifts and a couple actions that take only a few minutes a day.  These can’t solve the most severe stress-related problems, but they can help most of us in a major way. Instead of being in a stressful task-switching state of mind, take your next task, let everything else go, and just be in the moment with this one task. Let yourself be immersed in this task by letting go of the feeling that you need to quickly rush through it – that you need to move on to the next task waiting for you.  There will always be a next task, because that’s the nature of TO-DO lists – they’re never-ending.  So let those later tasks come later.  Just be 100% in this one task, like it’s your entire world. Bottom line: Slow down.  Breathe.  Review your commitments and goals.  Put first things first.  Do one task at a time.  Start now.  Take a 5-minute break in an hour.  Repeat.  (And always remember, results are more important than the time it takes to achieve them.) Fear is causing you to be stressed, not external factors like your job obligations or family issues.  Those external factors are just a part of life, but they become stressful when you fear failure, fear people won’t like you, fear you’re not good enough, fear abandonment, and so forth. Your fears are based on some fantasy in your head about how things are supposed to be (and you fear that your life may not live up to that fantasy): you have an image in your head that you’re going to be perfect, have people like you, be comfortable all the time, and succeed on all fronts.  These fantasies are a way to feel in control of a world that you don’t actually control, but they’re hurting you by causing fear and stress.  Instead, let go of control.  Be OK with chaos and uncertainty, and trust that things will work out.  You’ll fear less and feel less stress.  (Read The Untethered Soul.) We get upset with others because they don’t meet our fantasy of how they “should” act.  Instead, try accepting them for who they are, and recognize that, like you, they’re imperfect and seeking happiness and struggling with finding it.  They’re doing their best.  Accept them just the way they are.  In most cases it’s impossible to change them anyway (and it’s rude to try).  So save yourself from needless stress… Instead of trying to change others, give them your support today and lead by example. You don’t have to meditate for 30 minutes to get the benefits of mindfulness… You can do each of these short mindfulness practices in little bits whenever you need them throughout your day. You must learn a new way to think before you can master a new way to be.  Behind every stressful feeling is an untrue thought.  Before the thought you weren’t suffering, but after the thought you began to suffer.  When you recognize that the thought isn’t true, once again there is no suffering.  When you change your thoughts, you change your life.  So next time you catch a thought stressing you out, ask yourself these four questions: (Angel and I discuss this process in detail in the “Letting Go of Painful Emotions” lesson of the Getting Back to Happy course.) Sometimes the reason we struggle with stress and insecurity is because we compare our behind-the-scenes circumstances with everyone else’s public highlight reel.  Give it up.  Don’t compare your Chapter 1 to someone else’s Chapter 15.  Follow your own path, write your own life story, and never give up on yourself. Next time you catch yourself comparing your life situation to someone else’s, refer to these two formulas: Overlooking everything that’s wonderful is a tragedy.  Do your best and surrender the rest.  When you stay stuck in worried thoughts of the life you think you should have, you end up missing the beauty of what you do have.  You will have a hard time ever being happy if you aren’t thankful for the good things in your life right now. Here’s a super simple, five-minute, daily gratitude exercise that has worked wonders for thousands of our coaching clients over the past decade: Every evening before you go to bed, write down three things that went well during the day and their causes.  Simply provide a short, causal explanation for each good thing. That’s it. We spend tens of thousands of dollars on expensive electronics, big homes, fancy cars and lavish vacations hoping for a boost of happiness.  This is a free alternative, and it works. In a study of this gratitude exercise’s effectiveness by Martin Seligman, participants were asked to follow those exact instructions for just one week.  After one week the participants were measurably 2% happier than before, but in follow-up tests their happiness kept on increasing, from 5% at one month, to 9% at six months.  Even more interestingly, the participants were only required to keep this gratitude journal for one week, but the majority of them continued journaling on their own because they enjoyed it. I tried it for myself many years ago – I set a goal of doing it for just one week, and I’m still doing it today.  So I can assure you, it’s addictively effective.  (Angel and I discuss this in detail in the Happiness chapter of our New York Times bestselling book, Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs.) I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, your body is the greatest instrument you own.  So when all else fails, and your stress levels are mounting, use your body to sooth your mind. The mind reflects your body by responding to its levels of tension, rate of breath, speed of movement and mental focus.  Likewise your body mirrors your thoughts, feelings, mood, and responds to your state of mind, the questions you ask and the words you speak.  So if the mind and body are intrinsically connected – meaning that one has a direct affect on the other – it becomes clear that if we directly and consciously take control of one, it will influence and transform the other. By mindfully adjusting how you use your body you can directly influence your state of mind, and dramatically transform your attitude.  Just imagine you’re sitting there in a bad mood, shoulders hanging forward, shallow breathing and frowning.  Go ahead and do this right now to experience how it influences your state of mind.  And then do the opposite: stand up straight and put a big smile on your face.  Take some deep, strong breaths and stretch your arms into the air. Notice how you feel better? Bottom line: Take the vehicle your creator has given you and use it!  Your body is the best tool for changing your attitude and relieving stress in an instant. If you’re still looking to make positive changes after doing the eight things above, I have a few more recommendations: And remember that most people cope with stress in the easiest, unhealthy ways imaginable – drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, eating sweets, arguing with people, mindlessly watching TV, procrastinating, and so forth.  Ironically, these activities often cause even more stress and mental anguish.  So don’t take the easy way out.  Instead, use the ideas above to cope without these unhealthy crutches… Start doing the hard things you know you need to for yourself! Every.  Single.  Day. Before you go, I’d love to hear from YOU in the comments section below.

Should it all end tonight, I can positively say there would be no regrets. I feel fortunate to have walked 90 years in my shoes. I am truly lucky. I really have lived 1,000 times over.” Those are the opening lines of the final entry in my grandmother Zelda’s journal—a 270-page leather-bound journal she wrote small entries in almost every morning during the final decade of her life. In it, she reflected on lessons she had learned, lessons she was still learning, and the experiences that made these understandings possible. When my grandmother was diagnosed with terminal cancer on her 90th birthday, I sat with her in a hospital room for the entire day, in silence, in laughter, in tears, and in awe. Although her body was weak, her mind was intensely strong. The terminal diagnosis inspired her to think about her life, everything she had journaled about over the years, and reflect aloud. So, I gave her the stage—my undivided attention—from sunrise until sunset. As I sat beside her hospital bed, she thumbed through her journal one page at a time, reading dozens of specific entries she wanted me to hear. She spoke softly and passionately about her life, her loves, her losses, her pain, her dreams, her achievements, her happiness, and all the lessons that embodied these points of reference. It was without a doubt one of the most enlightening and unforgettable days of my life. My grandmother passed away exactly two weeks later, peacefully in her sleep. The day after her passing I found out she formally left her journal for me in her will. Since then, I have read it from cover to cover countless times. Although I have shared some of her insights and quotes with blog subscribers, course students, and coaching clients in the past, today would have been my grandmother’s 105th birthday, so I’d like to honor her. To do so, I’m going to re-share excerpts from the journal entries that she shared with me in that hospital room fifteen years ago. I’ve done my best to sort, clean up, copyedit and reorganize her wisdom into 19 inspiring bullet points. I hope you find value in them, too: As I’m wrapping up this short tribute to my grandmother, I’m reminded of a poem by Christian D. Larson that she used to have hanging on her refrigerator when I was a kid. As soon as I was old enough to understand the poem, my grandmother made a photocopy of it for me, and, over 30 years later, I still have that same photocopy laminated and hanging on my office bulletin board. These are words I do my best to live by: “Promise Yourself… To be so strong that nothingcan disturb your peace of mind.To talk health, happiness, and prosperityto every person you meet. To make all your friends feelthat there is something in themTo look at the sunny side of everythingand make your optimism come true. To think only the best, to work only for the best,and to expect only the best.To be just as enthusiastic about the success of othersas you are about your own. To forget the mistakes of the pastand press on to the greater achievements of the future.To wear a cheerful countenance at all timesand give every living creature you meet a smile. To give so much time to the improvement of yourselfthat you have no time to criticize others.To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear,and too happy to permit the presence of trouble. To think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world,not in loud words but great deeds.To live in faith that the whole world is on your sideso long as you are true to the best that is in you.” (Note: Angel and I discuss strategies for living true to these words in the Happiness and Self-Love chapters of our “1,000 Little Things” and “Getting Back to Happy” books.) If you’re feeling up to it, Angel and I would love to hear from YOU. Which point mentioned above resonates with you the most today, and why? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

"Make a Change Today: One Thing You Need to Stop Doing to Yourself|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/change-the-world.jpg?resize=500%2C357&ssl=1| Imagine for a moment the year is 2000 B.C. and you’re a fisherman living along the coast of what is now Southern Europe.  Like any other morning, you’re fishing when suddenly a powerful burst of energy enters your body.  It creates a tingling sensation in your fingertips, a flutter in your heart and warmth in your belly.  You know it’s not anxiety or a heart attack because it feels comforting and fulfilling. You put your fishing pole down and sit at the water’s edge.  You reach down and splash a handful of cool water up onto your face.  It is here, in this quiet moment, that you have an epiphany.  And while you are unable to explain how or why this epiphany is coming to you now—you haven’t done anything out of the ordinary to receive it—its message is crystal clear: The Earth is not flat.  The Earth is a sphere.  You can visualize it revolving around the sun in a predictable orbital pattern.  These visualizations also reveal that the Earth is part of a solar system of eight planets separate from other stars in the night’s sky and that these other stars follow similar predictable patterns of movement.  There is a whole uncharted universe out there that nobody else is aware of. Once the magnitude of your epiphany settles in your mind, you begin to sweat from nervousness.  Because while the small seaside village you live in is peaceful, there is little tolerance for outlandish ideas and theories like the ones that just rattled your brain.  If you were to tell others about them, the nobles and town leaders might interpret it as a direct threat to the cultural stability of the community, and the rest of the villagers would likely think you’re crazy.  You could be exiled! You decide that you must handle your business as usual and leave the deep visions and epiphanies to the witch doctors and nomads who dwell in the forests on the outskirts of civilization.  These people have already decided that the world they grew up in doesn’t hold the answers they are looking for.  They are the ones who should convey these outlandish ideas to the world.  Because they have nothing to lose.  At least not as much as you do. So, you don’t tell a soul about your epiphany.  Days roll into weeks.  Weeks roll into months.  And you imagine, each day, that you are better off for having kept it a secret.  But you are also aware that keeping this secret is eating away at you from the inside out.  You have distanced yourself from people and have been sleeping less and less.  Your mind won’t stop stirring. One night, after hours of stirring, you finally fall asleep and begin to dream.  You dream you’re sitting at round table in a dimly lit room.  There is a woman sitting across the table from you.  You can barely make out her face, but you can see her hair is silver and her skin is worn.  She seems old and wise.  And it feels like she can see right through to your soul.  But you also feel comforted because there is nothing to hide from her.  She already knows what you know. “Do you know why you’re sitting here with me?” she asks in a low, soothing voice. “I don’t know,” you reply.  “I guess I’m here because I have no one else I can talk to.” She smiles and says, “You are here because you have something to say.  Something you know is of immense importance; it’s something that will change the world when you finally say it.  But, you are afraid to say it because you don’t think people are ready to hear it.” You sit in silence with her for a moment.  Just staring into her eyes.  You feel an energy emanating from her heart and gently soothing yours.  Easing it of tension.  Letting it know that it can beat loudly and proudly at any pace it wants to without concern.  Because it’s safe here—a sanctuary devoid of judgment.  And all of the fear inside you slowly subsides. You take a deep breath and say, “I am here because I had an epiphany in which I saw, clearly, that the earth is not flat.  It is a sphere that revolves around the sun as part of an eight planet solar system.  And there are other stars out there too, perhaps in other solar systems in what is likely a vast, uncharted universe.” You pause for a moment, take two more deep breaths and continue, “I don’t know where this epiphany came from or why it came to me when it did.  But I’ve since done some preliminary tests and the results seem to prove my epiphany’s accuracy.  In fact, at this point I’m certain it’s accurate.  And I’m certain, also, that the people of this world aren’t ready for it.  I have already been punished for having this epiphany—for simply knowing what I know.  And I don’t want to be punished once more for conveying what I know to others.” She smiles again.  And, as she smiles, you feel more comforted than you have since before you had your epiphany.  “In all walks of life, you will never know when the world is ready,” she says.  “You will only know when you are ready.  And you will know when you are simply because you will take action and do something about it.  And after you do something, you will know when there is more to do, because you will do more.” Her words of wisdom are so clear, so simple.  But the real world, you recall, is far more twisted and convoluted.  In the real world, there are cultures and customs that have been around for generations that must be dealt with. “The most important thing to remember,” she continues, “is that while it may feel like you are at the mercy of the world, you are not.  Because the world around you is merely a reflection of what’s inside you—your thoughts.  So what feels like an entire world that isn’t ready, isn’t really a world at all.  It’s just you.  And when you change, you will notice that the world outside has changed too.” Your eyes slowly open.  You sit up in bed and silently meditate over your dream.  After a few moments, you stand up and walk out the front door of your cabin to get some fresh air.  And as you stand there watching the sun rise over the village, you notice something is different.  The entire village seems brighter and more alive than you remember.  Has the village changed?  Have the people changed?  Or is it just you?  You aren’t sure. What you are sure of is that you have fish to catch today.  And that you have something important to say.  And while you don’t know yet how you will say it, you are gradually growing more and more confident that you will know soon.  And by the time you realize you know, you will have already begun to say what you need to say. And the world around you will have already begun to change. Because you have changed. Why did I just share that story with you? Because doing so helps remind me. And, I know you need a reminder sometimes too. Sometimes we all need to be reminded of how our silence and inaction can become self-abuse. You have to admit, to a certain extent, you have spent too much of your life tiptoeing around.  Trying to become quieter.  Smaller.  Less sensitive and intuitive.  Less “crazy.”  Less YOU.  Because you didn’t want to overwhelm people.  You wanted to make a good impression with them.  You wanted to fit in.  You wanted everyone to like you.  You wanted everything to be easy.  So, for too much of your life, you’ve sacrificed a part of yourself—a part of the truth—for the sake of not stepping out of line.  And for too much of your life, you’ve hurt yourself with your own silence and inaction.

Oh, it’s the majestic harmony of young love!  When two souls who barely know each other believe they know everything that they must know to live happily ever after in their own blissful bubble.  They think this way because it’s what their emotional hearts and minds tell them is true at the moment. But you know what happens next.  It’s what always happens next in contrived fairy tales like this.  For one reason or another, logic trumps emotion, their bubble bursts, and the two lovers tumble back down to Earth, bruising themselves along the way and realizing that their perfect, easygoing partner isn’t so perfect or easygoing after all. Maybe he learns that she doesn’t like to dance, and dancing is extremely important to him.  Maybe she learns that he never makes the bed, and making the bed is extremely important to her.  Regardless of the specifics, our lovers are finally beginning to see each other for who they really are—imperfect human beings.  This is the turning point at which “falling in love” ends and the real work and test of true love begins. Either their mindset adjusts and they accept reality—that true love isn’t so much about ease and perfection as it is about growth and patience—or they give up and move on to the next short-term fairy tale romance in hopes of finding that one easygoing, perfect soul mate who does everything just right. Why am I telling you this story? Because the fluctuating feelings that steer our romantic relationships are quite similar to those that steer our motivation to make a meaningful impact in our lives, and thus a meaningful impact in the world.  A little passion is all that’s required to start, but only sustained perseverance makes it worthwhile. Sure, short powerful bursts of effort and seemingly giant leaps in a single bound appear to be remarkable.  But they fade as fast as they arrive, and all we’re left with in the end is an unfulfilled void, an empty promise. An enduring dedication—fulfilling promises by marching forward with one foot in front of the other, even when the going gets tough, and even when it would be much easier to give up—is what true love is all about.  And it’s this kind of love, and only this kind of love, that can make the world a better place, and us stronger, healthier, and happier human beings in the long run. “I’m dying of Leukemia at age 23.  I was sent home from the hospital for my final few weeks 156 days ago.  But now I’m back at the hospital being treated again.  My doctors now believe there is hope.  And I just want to thank you and Angel, because your Getting Back to Happy course has been my single source of guidance and inspiration on the absolute hardest, loneliest nights.” That’s the opening paragraph of an email Angel and I received recently from a course student named Susan (I’m sharing this with permission).  Susan’s words continue to remind me that harsh circumstances will occasionally break us down to the lowest of lows.  But if we keep our minds focused on the positive, our hearts open to love, and continue to put one foot in front of the other, we can recover the pieces, rebuild, and fight back with more strength and determination than we ever imagined possible. Susan has literally been fighting against all odds, and gradually overcoming them!  It has been incredible to witness her progress firsthand through our phone and email communication.  Day by day, she has emotionally freed herself from some of the ideals that once meant a lot to her—like not being ill—so she can move beyond them and the pain they bring.  This has ultimately contributed to the progress she’s made and the renewed hope her doctors now have. Think about how this relates to the “enduring dedication” I mentioned in the first story above. And, think about how it relates to YOUR life… Your response is always more powerful than your circumstance.  A tiny part of your life is decided by completely uncontrollable circumstances, while the vast majority of your life is decided by your responses. The goal isn’t to get rid of all your painful thoughts, feelings, and life circumstances.  That’s impossible.  The goal is to follow in Susan’s footsteps, and change your response to them today! It’s never too late.  Just decide to make the best of it.  No excuses.  No resistance.  No giving up.  No regrets. …remind yourself: Angel and I have spent the past decade working with hundreds of coaching clients, course students, and live event attendees who struggle with everything we’ve just examined together in this article.  And we struggle sometimes too.  So, if you’re struggling in any way right now, please know that you are not alone.  Just keep doing your best to love every step openly and continuously—to do the hard things you need to do—so you can step forward again with grace.  Watch this short video clip we created for you:  And if you’re up to it, we’d love to know: Please leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

Where Happiness is Found: The Stories Too Many People Believe for Too Long|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/the-stories-people-believe.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| I know a man who loves to knit.  Blankets, quilts, sweaters… he knits them all.  Knitting is his hobby, his love.  He could choose another hobby—something a bit more masculine, like restoring vintage cars or hunting.  But this man continues to stick with what makes him happy—knitting.  Because he discovered knitting when he was only a little boy who didn’t know any better.  And now, it’s a huge part of who he is. As he grew into his teenage years he was made aware of the fact that knitting wasn’t a common hobby for a boy.  “Knitting is a hobby for girls or for boys who like to wear high heels,” his older brother used to say.  Over time, after being frequently ridiculed by his own family and others, he eventually asked himself a question:  “Are the opinions others have about knitting at all relevant to my experience of knitting as a hobby?”  And he immediately realized the answer was “No!”  So, he kept enjoying the hobby—the love—that made him happy. It’s fascinating how we make certain decisions in life.  Sometimes we follow our heart and intuition and we choose the thing that makes the most sense to us—that which makes us happy.  Other times we follow our fears and expectations, especially those spawned by the culture and society we live in, and we choose whatever we believe will most appease those fears and expectations—that which makes everyone else (or no one at all) happy. The man who loves to knit remained open-minded and stuck to knitting even when he learned about the cultural and societal expectations that suggested he should give it up.  But he didn’t always carry forth with this same open-minded attitude.  For instance, he believed for as long as he could remember that he would someday find the perfect mate.  And he knew exactly what she would be like. The story about her that he inscribed in his head when he was in his adolescence hasn’t changed much since.  Nor has it drastically changed since he told me a story about her just a few short months ago over a cup of coffee.  The beginning of the story goes something like this: “I’ve always dreamed that someday I would meet the perfect mate.  She would be smart and classy, yet sexy and athletic.  And she would be a geek like me.  I wouldn’t care what her religious background was, so long as she had an open mind and an honest heart.  But she would have to be neat and tidy, because I’m not and I need someone who can balance me out. And she would love to snuggle, like me.  Because I would want to hold her at night, and because we would need to be close so we could fool around and giggle and talk softly to each other.  We would talk about people, places, our lives and our future together for hours into the night. And money wouldn’t matter to either of us because we’d be in love.  She’d know it and I’d know it, and we’d be happy with what we had…” The stories we tell ourselves and each other sound remarkable, don’t they?  They romanticize us.  They sweep us off our feet.  They persuade us to believe that if we dive head first into a new relationship, a big financial purchase, greasy foods, imported beers, or whatever it is that temporarily pacifies our worried mind from reality, then we will somehow find what we are truly looking for. Our obvious dilemma is that reality is not temporary.  Reality keeps on coming.  That new relationship will have our heart blissfully skipping beats until it doesn’t any longer.  That big financial purchase will be fun and exciting until it isn’t any longer.  Greasy foods and beer will comfort us… until they don’t any longer. Although he still has a long way to go, the man who loves to knit is gradually becoming aware of the temporary, restrictive nature of the stories we tell ourselves.  Because the ending to his story about his perfect mate—the part that comes after the introduction I shared with you above—is about a real woman who was absolutely amazing, but who didn’t perfectly fit the mold of the woman from the story he inscribed in his head.  And he was unable to give up the perfect woman from his story for the amazing woman standing in front of him.  When she eventually realized this on a Saturday morning three weeks ago, she firmly moved on without him. Although still a bit shaken up and heartbroken, the man is also starting to move on.  Day by day, he’s rediscovering his true self—the self he knew when he was younger, before he started telling himself stories, or buying into the stories, fears and expectations of those who lurk around him.  This self was a blank canvas, free to experience and appreciate everything just the way it is, without the burden of a storyline. And as he slowly rediscovers himself, he struggles with the notion of life without a storyline.  Because he can barely remember what life was like when there was no story, no fears, no expectations.  But he knows deep down that he once lived in a world free of them.  And when he did, he discovered knitting and fell in love with it.  It became one of his greatest sources of happiness.  And he knows that if he wants to fall in love like that again, he must get back to that story-free world within himself where happiness is found. When I shared the story above with a small group of VIP attendees at our most recent Think Better, Live Better conference, a woman named Annie raised her hand and said (I’m sharing this with permission): “The ‘story-free world.’  I love that!  I can honestly relate in the most profound way. My husband suffered a head injury in 2014 that wiped away his long-term, lifetime memories.  He doesn’t remember anything before Summer of that year—including our past.  He did, however, know he loved me.  It was like an innate knowing.  The same as his passions, which have remained as they were before his injury, even though he couldn’t tell you anything about how he pursued them before 2014. At 50-years-old, my husband has only four years of ‘stories,’ and I have seen this turn him into a very happy man.  He invents himself a day at a time.  He has a child-like quality (as in eagerness and appreciation) that is inspiring to be around.  I think he embodies the ‘story-free world,’ and I can attest to what a wondrous place it is.” Then, as a group, we discussed Annie’s experience, and openly practiced questioning our own stories, and letting them go.  Here’s the basic gist of what we practiced together: (Note: This section is an excerpt from our NYT bestselling book.) First and foremost, it’s important to understand that many of the biggest misunderstandings in life could be avoided if we simply took the time to ask, “What else could this mean?”  A wonderful and practical way to do this is by using a reframing tool we initially picked up from research professor Brené Brown, which we then tailored through our coaching work with students and conference attendees.  We call the tool The story I’m telling myself.  Although asking the question itself—“What else could this mean?”—can help reframe our thoughts and broaden our perspectives, using the simple phrase “The story I’m telling myself is” as a prefix to troubling thoughts has undoubtedly created many “aha moments” for our students and conference attendees in recent times. Here’s how it works:  The story I’m telling myself can be applied to any difficult life situation or circumstance in which a troubling thought is getting the best of you.  For example, perhaps someone you love (husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, etc.) didn’t call you on their lunch break when they said they would, and now an hour has passed and you’re feeling upset because you’re obviously not a high enough priority to them.  When you catch yourself feeling this way, use the phrase:  The story I’m telling myself is that they didn’t call me because I’m not a high enough priority to them. Then ask yourself these questions: Give yourself the space to think it all through carefully.  Challenge yourself to think differently!  The story I’m telling myself and the three related questions give you tools for revisiting and reframing the troubling or confusing situations that arise in your daily life.  From there, you can challenge the stories you subconsciously tell yourself and do a reality check with a more objective mindset. This will ultimately allow you to let go of the stories that aren’t serving you and the people you love. And, if you’re up to it, I’d love know: What did you think of this blog post?

The Unwritten Love Poem: Why True Love is So Hard to Express|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/the-unwritten-love-poem.jpg?resize=500%2C316&ssl=1| Twenty years ago, I wrote an unsigned love poem to a girl I barely knew.  I told Brianna, among other things, that life was a blaze of magnificence, that she made it even brighter, and that someday I would spend every day with the prettiest girl in the world. When she read the poem she got goose bumps, smiled from ear to ear, and daydreamed about the gentleman behind the poetic prose.  She showed it to her sister who sighed and said, “How romantic!  I wish someone would write me a poem like that.”  Then she showed it to her parents.  Her mom smirked, but her dad frowned and said, “Don’t waste your time on a foolish boy hiding behind a silly poem.”  Finally, she let her new boyfriend read it.  In a grim voice he said, “Let me know when you find out who wrote it, because I’d like to give him a piece of my mind!” Despite reactions ranging from enthusiasm to aggravation, she kept the poem and still has it in her possession today, two decades later.  Her younger brother, Jose, recently found it neatly folded and tucked between two pages of an old photo album she keeps in her den. I know all of this because Jose told me.  He and I met in school twenty years ago and we have been best friends ever since.  He was, frankly, the reason I wrote the poem. “Your sister is pretty,” I told Jose during my first visit to his home. “Forget about it,” he said.  “Brianna has buff guys fighting for her affection every day.  You couldn’t hold her attention long enough to get a second glance.” “I could if I wrote her a poem,” I replied. “She has guys writing her romantic crap all the time,” he said.  “She’ll just toss it out with all the other failed attempts.” “Not mine,” I insisted. “You’re crazy,” he chuckled.  “Go ahead and try.  Make me laugh!” I wrote the poem that evening and mailed it anonymously the next morning. The poem I wrote Brianna wasn’t genuine, at least not in my mind.  I wrote it because Jose doubted me.  Sure, I thought Brianna was pretty, but I didn’t want to settle down with her.  At the time, I didn’t even know her.  And as it turns out, she and I have almost nothing in common. The last genuine love poem I wrote went to a girl I met a month before I met Brianna.  She was on the varsity soccer team, and her beauty was majestic.  I wrote Sara a poem and slipped it into her locker the same afternoon.  I confessed my desire to be a soccer ball, and risk being kicked around, if it was the only way I could catch her attention.  She caught up with me the next morning and told me I didn’t need to transform into a soccer ball to catch her attention.  I asked her out on a date a few minutes later. Our first date went well.  But the next afternoon Sara spoke to a few of her teammates, two of which I had previously dated.  She was appalled when she found out that I had written Jackie a poem about innocent kisses blown her way in the breeze, and Carol a poem about the lucky sunshine that glistens off her skin.  Needless to say, a second date was not in our future. “Stupid me!  When I read the poem you wrote me, I actually believed you were being sincere!  I thought I was special,” Sara screamed! “I was… and you are,” I mumbled as she stomped away. But Sara had a point.  Although I had never summoned the desire to be a soccer ball in any of my previous poems, I did use similar analogies that carried the same fundamental message of flirtatious affection. I wasn’t trying to hurt her.  I thought she was gorgeous.  I thought she carried herself with amazing grace.  I wanted to be around her.  I wanted to be hers.  She was the most perfect girl in the entire world… and I felt this way a hundred times before. Roughly six months after I met Brianna, I met Angel.  I realized shortly thereafter that she moved me in a way the others had not.  I couldn’t consciously pinpoint it, but I knew our relationship felt special.  Even after the initial excitement fatigued, she kept me captivated in awe.  I was wide awake in the second inning for the first time in my life. Angel and I have been together for nineteen years now—we’ve been through a lot together—and I appreciate her more and more with each passing day.  Yet despite my love for her, she’s never received a love poem. It’s not that I haven’t tried.  I tried, once, to write her a poem about the depth and beauty of her hazel-green eyes.  I stumbled over my words.  Another time I tried to write her a poem about the mornings I wake up early just to watch her sleep.  I failed again.  And just last month I tried to write her a poem entitled “Amidst an Angel.”  But no two words would rhyme. Nineteen years and not a single love poem written.  Of course, Angel knows I love to write, so she has occasionally questioned my motives for never writing her a romantic piece. Yesterday evening I found myself trying again.  I tried to poetically recreate the story of our first encounter.  I wanted to make it cute.  I wanted to make her smile.  I wanted to make her cry.  I wanted to typify our tale in exquisite prose.  Nothing came. I fell asleep around midnight last night thinking about my predicament.  Have I completely lost my touch?  Has someone cast an evil spell on me?  Or is there a more profound, philosophical explanation? Zzzz… I dreamt I was sitting at round table in a dimly lit room.  There was a man sitting across the table from me.  He looked a lot like me, only his hair was silver and his skin was worn. “I’m here to answer your question,” he said. “What question?” I asked. “The one you’ve been asking yourself for almost two decades,” he replied. “What’s wrong with me?” I huffed.  “Why can’t I write Angel a love poem?” “Perhaps you can’t write her a love poem because you realize, subconsciously, that leaving it unwritten is the most profound affirmation of love you can make.  Because you truly do love her, and true love cannot be translated into words.  Because words alone could never do her any justice.” I nodded in agreement. He went on, “The sad truth, of course, is that this affirmation of true love will always remain unnoticed.  Because there is no visible output to notice—no poem to read.” My eyes popped open. It was 4:30 AM, but I was wide awake and inspired to write about the epiphany I had in my dreams.  I leaned over, kissed Angel on the forehead, and rolled out of bed.  I powered on my laptop and opened the word processor I use for blogging.  After gazing at the blank white screen for several minutes, I placed my fingers on the keyboard and titled the page:  The Unwritten Love Poem: Why True Love is So Hard to Express . . . Why did I just share that story with you? Because doing so helps remind me. And, I know you need a reminder sometimes too. Sometimes we all need to be reminded of the beauty and sweetness of truly loving someone without the forced glitz, glam, and airbrushing of the Instagraming world we live in.  Because it’s so easy to forget.  It’s so easy to see the fairy-tale highlight reel of staged romance that scrolls across our screens, and feel inadequate by comparison. We need to remind ourselves that loving someone—truly and profoundly loving them—isn’t about crafting the perfect love poem, photographing the perfect internet kiss, or showing off in any way; it’s about showing up every day behind closed doors to quietly respect and support someone who means the world to us. Do you agree? Do you feel like your love is hard to accurately express? Do you have your own “unwritten love poem” pulsing through your heart and mind? I know this blog post is a little different, but I’d love to know what you think. Please leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

I sat silently for a moment.  My eyes gazed from her eyes to the ground and back to her eyes again.  “So, you’re saying I should want to feel like this?” “To an extent,” she said.  “Let me put it this way:  Taking all your feelings seriously all the time, and letting them drive you into misery, is a waste of your amazing spirit.  You have to know that sometimes what you feel simply won’t align with what’s true and right in this world; it’s just your subconscious mind’s way of allowing you to look at things from a different perspective.  These feelings will come and go as long as you let them go… as long as you consciously see them for what they are.” We shared another moment of silence, then my lips curled up slightly and I cracked a smile.  “Thank you, Grandma,” I said. That conversation with my grandmother took place on a warm September evening over two decades ago.  I remember it vividly because I was smart enough to write a five-page journal entry about it immediately afterwards.  And, what I wrote continues to remind me of how easy it is to fall into a self-deprecating state of mind—to subconsciously belittle oneself when times get tough.  For instance, over the years, I can’t even begin to tell you how many times I’ve caught myself thinking, “You’re not good enough!” simply because I wasn’t having a good day. Can you relate at all? To an extent, I bet you can.  Because we all do this to ourselves sometimes… You have a story about yourself (or perhaps a series of them) that you recite to yourself daily.  This is your mental movie, and it’s a feature film that plays on repeat in your mind.  Your movie is about who you are: you have a chubby tummy, your skin is too dark, you aren’t smart, you aren’t lovable… you aren’t good enough.  Start to pay attention when your movie plays—when you feel anxiety about being who you are—because it affects everything you do.  Realize that this movie isn’t real, it isn’t true, and it isn’t you.  It’s just a train of thought that can be stopped—a script that can be rewritten. Ready to rewrite the script?  Good! Start by admitting to yourself that you’ve spent a lot of your life subconsciously belittling yourself.  Thinking you’re not enough.  Wishing to be someone else.  Someone who fits in, who’s less sensitive, needy, and flawed.  Someone who is less YOU.  Because you felt broken and didn’t want to scare people away.  You wanted to make a good impression and have people like you.  To be seen as worthy and lovable so you could feel healed and whole.  And for the longest time, behind a facade of fake smiles, you have inadvertently betrayed yourself for the purpose of pleasing everyone else.  And for longest time, your heart has ached in a subtle way. But now you’re seeing things differently, right? Belittling yourself just doesn’t make sense anymore.  And more than that, you now realize no matter what you do or how you change, some people will never respect you anyway, and some situations will never nurture your soul. You now realize you have to start doing things for the right reasons. Not because it’s what you think everyone else needs, but because you finally know yourself to be worthy of your own love and care. Not because other people approve of you, but because you are breathing your own air, thinking your own thoughts, and occupying a space no one else ever could. You may have been beaten down by adversity, or sidetracked by rejection, but you are not broken.  So don’t let your subconscious mind, or anyone or anything else, convince you otherwise.  Heal yourself by refusing to belittle yourself.  Choose to stand out, to do what you know in your heart is right.  Choose to appreciate yourself for who you are, accepting your quirks entirely and sincerely. Let the truth sink in.  And then remind yourself of it—read the reminders above—again and again, anytime you catch yourself belittling yourself.  Bring awareness to the false, self-deprecating story—that mental movie—you’re so used to reciting.  Then, rewrite the script… One day at a time. One reminder at a time. Change the way you see yourself. See how every day, every step, every lesson, every deep breath, and every little reminder matters. And along these lines, I’ll leave you with this short excerpt from our New York Times bestselling book, Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs: “In the end, all the small things make a big difference.  Every step is crucial.  Life isn’t about a single moment of great triumph and attainment.  It’s about the trials and errors that slowly get you there—the blood, sweat, tears, and the small, inconsequential things you do on a day-to-day basis.  It all matters in the end—every step, every regret, every decision, every minor setback and minuscule win. The seemingly useless happenings add up to something.  The minimum-wage job you had in high school.  The evenings you spent socializing with coworkers you never see anymore.  The hours you spent writing thoughts on a personal blog that no one reads.  Contemplations about elaborate future plans that never came to be. All those lonely nights spent reading novels and news columns and comic strips, questioning your own principles on life and sex and religion and whether or not you’re good enough just the way you are. All of this has strengthened you.  All of this has led you to every success you’ve ever had.  All of this has made you who you are today.  And all of this proves that you have the strength to deal with the challenges in front of you.” Marc and I have spent the past decade working with hundreds of coaching clients, course students, and live event attendees who struggle with everything we’ve just examined together in this article.  And, as I mentioned above, I struggle sometimes too.  So, if you’re struggling in any way right now, please know that you are not alone.  Watch this short video clip I created for you:  And if you’re up to it, I’d love to know: Please leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

"9 Mindful Ways to Remain Calm When Others Are Angry|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/9-remain-calm-angry.jpg?resize=500%2C400&ssl=1| When someone upsets us, this is often because they aren’t behaving according to our fantasy of how they “should” behave.  The frustration, then, stems not from their behavior but from how their behavior differs from our fantasy.  Let’s not get carried away.  Calmness is a superpower. Over the past decade, there’s a way of being I’ve gradually been cultivating in myself—I’ve been taming my tendency to get angry and argue with people when their behavior doesn’t match my expectations. As human beings, we all have an idea in our heads about how things are supposed to be, and sadly this is what often messes our relationships up the most.  We all get frustrated when things don’t play out the way we expect them to, and people don’t behave like they’re “supposed” to.  We expect our spouses and children to act a certain way, our friends to be kind and agreeable, strangers to be less difficult, and so on and so forth. And when reality hits us, and everyone seems to be doing the opposite of what we want them to do, we overreact—anger, frustration, stress, arguments, tears, etc. So what can we do about this? You can’t control how other people behave.  You can’t control everything that happens to you.  What you can control is how you respond to it all.  In your response is your power. When you feel like your lid is about to blow, take a long deep breath.  Deep breathing releases tension, calms down our fight or flight reactions, and allows us to quiet our anxious nerves so we choose more considerate and constructive responses, no matter the situation. So, for example, do your best to inhale and exhale next time another driver cuts you off in traffic.  In a recent poll we hosted with 1,200 new course students, overreacting while fighting traffic was the most commonly cited reason for overreacting on a daily basis.  Just imagine if all the drivers on the road took deep breaths before making nasty hand gestures, or screaming obscenities at others. There’s no doubt that it can drive us crazy when we don’t get what we expect from people, especially when they are being rude and difficult.  But trying to change the unchangeable, wanting others to be exactly the way we want them to be, just doesn’t work.  The alternative, though, is unthinkable to most of us: to breathe, to let go, to lead by example, and to accept people even when they irritate us. Here’s the way of being that I’ve been cultivating and advocating: “Being” this way takes practice, but it’s worth it.  It makes me less frustrated, it helps me to be more mindful, it improves my relationships, it lowers my stress, and it allows me to make the world a slightly more peaceful place to be.  I hope you will join me. If you’re ready to feel more peace and less inner angst, here are some ways I’ve learned to remain calm and centered, even when those around me can’t seem to contain themselves.  These principles reinforce the bullet points above, and when you consistently practice these principles, the world within you and around you becomes a lot easier to cope with. Let’s practice, together… Don’t imagine the worst when you encounter a little drama.  When someone is acting irrationally, don’t join them by rushing to make a negative judgment call.  Instead, pause.  Take a deep breath… Sometimes good people behave poorly under stress.  Don’t you?  When you pause, it gives you space to collect your thoughts and it also allows the other person the space to take a deep breath with you.  In most cases, that extra time and space is all we need. Learn to respect the opinions of others.  Just because someone does it differently doesn’t make it wrong.  There are many roads to what’s right in this world.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. So choose your battles wisely.  And just agree to disagree sometimes. It is absolutely possible to connect with, and even appreciate the company of, someone you don’t completely agree with.  When you make a commitment to remain neutral on matters that don’t matter that much, or speak respectfully about your disagreements, both parties can remain calm and move forward, pleasantly. In the busyness of today’s world people tend to be worried, fearful, hurting and distracted about everything.  The word compassion means “to suffer with.”  When you can put yourself in the other person’s shoes, you give them the space to regroup, without putting any extra pressure on them. Remember, we never know what’s really going on in someone’s life.  When you interact with others in stressful environments, set an intention to be supportive by leaving the expectations, judgments and demands at the door. Everyone gets upset and loses their temper sometimes.  Remind yourself that we are all more alike than we are different.  When you catch yourself passing judgment, add “just like me sometimes” to the end of a sentence.  For example: Choose to let things GO.  Let others off the hook.  Take the high road today. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, if you take everything personally, you will be offended for the rest of your life.  And there’s no reason for it.  Even when it seems personal, rarely do people do things because of you, they do things because of them.  You know this is true.  You may not be able control all the things people say and do to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.  Make that decision for yourself today. Let it go!  Seriously, there is a huge amount of freedom that comes to you when you detach from other people’s beliefs and behaviors.  The way people treat you is their problem, how you react is yours. Everyone behaves the way they behave based on how they feel inside.  Some people never learn how to effectively cope with their stressful emotions.  When someone is acting obnoxious, it’s vital that you remain calm, no matter what.  Don’t allow other people to knock you off your center. Do what it takes to remain calm and address the situation from the inside out.  That’s where your greatest power lies. Don’t fall into an unnecessary argument just because you feel uncomfortable in silence.  Don’t say things you’ll regret five minutes later just to fill your eardrums with noise.  Anger and frustration begins internally.  You have the capacity to choose your response to momentary discomfort. Inhale.  Exhale.  A moment of silence in a moment of anger, can save you from a hundred moments of regret.  Truth be told, you are often most powerful and influential in an argument when you are most silent.  Others never expect silence.  They expect yelling, drama, defensiveness, offensiveness, and lots of back and forth.  They expect to leap into the ring and fight.  They are ready to defend themselves with sly remarks cocked and loaded.  But your mindful silence?  That can really disarm them. Don’t rush into your day by checking your phone or email.  Don’t put yourself it a stressful state of mind that’s incapable of dealing positively with other people’s negativity.  Create time and space for a morning ritual that’s focused and peaceful. Here’s part of my morning ritual:  I take ten deep breaths before getting out of bed, I stand up and stretch, and then do ten minutes of meditation. I challenge you to try this—it has been life-changing for me—but start small with just three deep breaths and three minutes of meditation a day.  Do this for 30 days.  After 30 days, if this daily ritual becomes easy, add another two breaths and another two minutes to your ritual.  When you begin a day mindfully, you lay the foundation for your day being calm and centered, regardless of what’s going on around you.  (Note: Marc and I build small, daily, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.) When we face stressful situations, we often calm or soothe ourselves with unhealthy choices—drinking alcohol, eating sugary snacks, smoking, etc.  It’s easy to respond to anger with anger and unhealthy distractions. Notice how you cope with stress.  Replace bad coping habits with healthy coping habits.  Take a walk in a green space.  Make a cup of tea and sit quietly with your thoughts.  Listen to some pleasant music.  Write in your journal.  Talk it out with a close friend.  Healthy coping habits make happy people.  (Note: This is covered in more detail in the “Self-Love” chapter of our book.) Keeping “the positive” in mind helps you move beyond the negativity around you. At the end of the day, reflect on your small daily wins and all the little things that are going well.  Count three small events on your fingers that happened during the day that you’re undoubtedly grateful for.  For example: And pay it forward when you get a chance too.  Let your positivity empower you to think kindly of others, speak kindly to others, and do kind things for others.  Kindness always makes a difference.  Create the outcomes others might be grateful for at the end of their day.  Be a bigger part of what’s right in this world. The most fundamental aggression to ourselves and others—the most fundamental harm we can do to human nature as a whole—is to remain ignorant by not having the awareness and the courage to look at ourselves and others honestly and gently. With this in mind, I’d love to hear your thoughts about this article.  What resonated with you?  What didn’t?  Is there anything else you would add to the list?

We sat there next to each other for nearly four hours while she sketched and I wrote.  And as I shifted back and forth, captivated in thought, I felt a bit self-conscious sometimes.  Because I could feel her watching me as she practiced her art. But I wasn’t too worried because I hadn’t planned on striking up a conversation with her.  After all, she seemed absolutely satisfied sketching in silence, and smiling at her sketches and at all the other people who surrounded us.  I did, however, glance up a few times just to see her smile.  Because her smile expressed a kind of passion and presence I seldom see. As the clock neared noon, a new customer came into the coffee shop and let a gust of wind in the front door.  The wind blew a completed sketch right off the elderly woman’s table and onto the floor directly in front of me.  The sketch was detailed and amazing.  It perfectly depicted a man who looked a lot like me typing on a laptop. I looked up at the elderly woman and smiled.  “Who’s that good-looking guy?” She chuckled and rolled her eyes.  “I don’t know,” she replied.  “He’s just a fairy tale character.”  She then handed me a few of the other sketches she’d been working on.  One of them was of the barista behind the counter and the others were of different customers in the coffee shop. “Wow!” I exclaimed. She sighed, smiled and said, “Sometimes I wish I could capture all of the world’s beauty in my sketches, but I’ve come to realize it’s simply impossible.  So, capturing still-frames of beautiful moments is what I settle for.” I told her that all of the world’s beauty actually is captured in every sketch that perceives a moment just as beautiful.  And that her sketches are truly beautiful, just like her smile, because they reveal a presence and a passion to see beauty in common places—a beauty most of us miss. She chuckled again and said, “My late mother once told me that beauty occurs when time ceases to exist.  And if she’s right, then perhaps my sketches are beautiful.  Because, for me, time ceases when I try to bridge my perceptions with the moments unfolding around me.” I smiled wide and then turned my laptop around so she could read the words I had written just moments before: “Time ceases to exist when she engages in this moment, because she wants nothing more than the beauty this moment has to offer.” “Who is she?” she asked. “She’s just a wise fairy tale character others will read about… and metaphor for hope to me,” I replied with a wink. She winked back, as if to prove she wasn’t just a metaphor.  And before I could even smile, I suddenly sneezed.  She laughed and told me that for just a moment in mid-sneeze I looked like Tarzan, and asked if I could hold that pose so she could sketch me looking like Tarzan. I told her I didn’t mind holding a mid-sneeze pose for a few minutes.  Because as she sketched, I got a chance to see the look in her eyes.  You know the look I’m talking about… it’s the look when beauty is perceived, time ceases to exist, and fairy tale characters come to life. Why did I just tell you that story? Because we all need a good reminder sometimes. We need to be reminded of the beauty of passionately absorbing oneself into the present moment—into the people, the dialogs, and the priceless little proceedings that exist there. We need to be reminded of what it’s like to bring “fairy tale characters” to life. Because too often, amidst the hurry and hustle, we forget. We forget what’s possible when we pay close attention We forget to appreciate the gifts directly in front of us. So, I wrote a story about my morning—just a routine morning at my favorite coffee shop—that brought unexpected beauty into my life simply because I was paying attention. I noticed the cute elderly woman sketching me.  I welcomed her presence.  I didn’t resist.  I didn’t try to change the situation.  I wasn’t in a hurry to get somewhere better… and neither was she. We were 100% there, in the moment, with each other. And, as a result, we created a truly memorable story together. Where you are and what you’re doing at any given moment is absolutely essential. Because it is the only moment guaranteed to you. You are not on your way somewhere else. You are not progressing to a more important time or place. The present is not just a stepping-stone—it is the ultimate destination. This moment is where your greatest opportunity lies. This moment is your life! It might seem obvious, but, again, we forget.  We all do, far more often than we’d like to admit. All day, every day, many of us feel like the present isn’t enough—like our life simply isn’t worthy of our full presence.  And because of this, we miss out on so much of life’s beauty. But what if we did the opposite? What if we accepted this moment, and everything and everyone in it (including ourselves), as exactly enough? What if we accepted the “bad” with the good, the letdowns with the lessons, the annoying with the interesting, the anxiety with the opportunity, as part of a package deal that this moment alone is offering us? What if we paused right now, and saw everything with perfect clarity? Keep thinking about it… Would we live more meaningful and memorable lives? Would we have more beautiful stories to cherish and share? I think we would. And thus, I think now is the best time to pay attention. Now is the best time to look around in awe—of our health, our homes, our families, our friends, our work, and our momentary opportunities. Now is the best time to notice the little fairy tales in our lives—to see what we’ve been missing all along. Two words: Mindful awareness. Far easier said than done, of course.  But doing so is worth every bit of effort you can muster. Mindful awareness as a daily practice is the ultimate challenge.  It’s a way of living, of being, of seeing, of tapping into the full power of your humanity. To practice, remind yourself to… Ritualize this kind of awareness into your daily routines, and you will undoubtedly change how you see and experience life from here on out.  (Angel and I build mindful, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.) After the elderly woman I met this morning finished sketching me in my best sneezing pose, she held up her sketch, admired it with a genuine smile, and said, “Oh Tarzan, I love it!  Why didn’t I learn to open my eyes and appreciate these encounters a little sooner in life, and treat every day like it was the first time, and the last?”  Then she paused for a moment in silence as she held her smile, took a deep breath, and with her eyes still locked on her sketch, she continued in a softer tone, “Oh Tarzan, my only regret is how often I subconsciously believed in the significance of tomorrow.” May we all take her sentiment to heart.  And learn from it. … Before you go, let’s revisit a question I asked above: How might doing so change what you see?

"5 Ways to Quiet the Negative Voices in Your Head|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/5-negative-voices.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| “There’s a brilliant, beautiful, priceless piece of art hanging right in front of you.  It’s sophisticated and meticulously detailed—a painstaking labor of passion and deep devotion.  The colors, patterns and textures are like no other—they soar and dip, they shine bright and leap right off the canvas at you.  And yet, you choose to fixate your eyes on the tiny, dark housefly that has landed on the edge this masterpiece.  Why would you choose to do such a thing?” She cracked a half smile in my direction and then shifted her gaze down to the ground. “Look,” I said, “the point here is that there’s no possible way to be 100% certain about anything in this world.  Life, like great art, is sophisticated, complex and unpredictable.  So you’re left with a choice: either appreciate it and look for the beauty it holds, or focus on the worst and dwell on it.” But if you expect the worst, you’re never quite as disappointed,” she said under her breath. “Yeah, but who truly lives like that?” I replied.  “No one, that’s who!  People die slowly every day like that, without ever truly living.” That’s the gist of a conversation I had recently with an attendee of our Think Better, Live Better conference (I’m sharing this with her full permission).  She literally started the conversation by telling me that expecting negative things to happen is her default way of coping with life’s challenges.  If you can relate in any way at all, it’s time to revamp your mindset. Believing in negative thoughts and acting on them is the single greatest barrier to living a healthy, productive life.  If you allow these thoughts to dwell for too long, they will succeed in robbing you of peace, joy, productivity, meaning, and ultimately your life.  You will think yourself into endless disappointment, heartache, and even bouts of depression. And make no misunderstanding about it, when you are feeling down on a consistent basis, the battle you are going through isn’t fueled by the words or actions of others, and it isn’t fueled by what did or didn’t happen in the past either.  It’s fueled entirely by your mind that gives negativity a voice.  In a very real sense, you are what you think—you can’t change anything if you can’t change your thinking. But, are you ready for the silver lining? YOU CAN change the way you think! And when you change the way you think, you can gradually master a new way to be. Today we’re going to take a look at a few effective methods for quieting that negative inner voice of yours—these are the very same methods we’ve successfully used with hundreds of new course students and coaching clients over the years.  But first, let’s examine a super-common error in judgment negative thinkers tend to make: People who are habitual negative thinkers are often proud to describe themselves as “realists.”  Of course, anyone who holds a strong belief thinks they are being “realistic” by holding it, whether it involves alien encounters, perfectly truthful politicians, or otherwise. The “being realistic” pronouncement is a favorite among cynics everywhere.  And in a way they are correct.  But only because negative thinking causes the human mind to give up on everything—to not even try, or to give a disorganized, half-hearted effort—so the negativity itself influences the end result.  Self-fulfilling predictions like this really do happen.  Research even suggests that in some cases what we believe about our health can have more bearing on how long we live than our actual physical health. So, why do we as human beings do this to ourselves? Because thinking negatively, expecting “the worst,” seeing the downside of positive situations, and even downright expecting failure, all convey a kind of backwards-thinking, emotional insurance policy.  It happens subconsciously and it goes something like, “If I expect a catastrophe, then I won’t be quite as disappointed when it takes place.” What makes all of this so alarming is the fact that it means negative thoughts can plague us even when life is going relatively well.  For instance, the thought “This is much too good to last!” quickly wreaks havoc on a positive situation.  Thus, the methods discussed below have to do with how negative thinking distorts our perception. Ready to get started? It’s time to… Ask yourself: “If something negative unexpectedly happens, do I over-generalize it?  Do I view it as applying to everything and being permanent rather than compartmentalizing it to one place and time?” For example, if someone rejects you or turns you down for a date, do you spread the negativity beyond that person, time and place by telling yourself, “I’m just not good at relationships; they never work out for me, ever”?  If you fail an exam do you say to yourself, “Well, I failed that exam; I’m not happy about it, but I’ll study more next time”?  Or do you over-generalize it by telling yourself you’re “not smart enough” or “incapable of learning”? Remember, negative thinking stops us from seeing and experiencing positive outcomes, even when they happen often.  It’s as if there’s a special mental block filtering out all the positives and only letting in data that confirms the negative biases we have.  So, do your very best to catch yourself today. Being able to distinguish between the negativity you imagine and what is actually happening in your life is an important step towards living a happier life.  (Note: Angel and I discuss this extensively in our NEW book.) Life simply isn’t black or white—100% of this or 100% of that—all or nothing.  Thinking in extremes like this is a fast way to misery, because it basically views any situation that’s less than perfect as being extremely bad.  For example: Since 99.9% of all situations in life are less than perfect, “all or nothing” thinking tends to make us focus on the negatives—the drama, the failures, and the worst-case scenarios.  Sure, catastrophes occur on occasion, but contrary to what you may see on the evening news, most of life occurs in a grey area between the extremes of bliss and total devastation. Our negativity leads us to quickly jump to negative conclusions about the unknown, which can be especially harmful in our relationships.  We are provoked to interpret something another person does as being negative, even when we have been given absolutely no indication of what the other person is thinking.  For instance, “He hasn’t called, so he must not want to talk to me,” or, “She only said that to be nice, but she doesn’t really mean it.”  When we jump to conclusions like this, we only cause ourselves and others unnecessary pain, stress and frustration. So, if someone says one thing, don’t assume they mean something else.  If they say nothing at all, don’t assume their silence has a concealed, negative connotation.  Assigning meaning to a situation before you have the whole story makes you more likely to believe that the uncertainty you feel (based on lack of knowing) is a negative sign. On the flip-side, holding off on assigning meaning to an incomplete story helps the mind overcome it’s negative thinking tendencies.  When you think more positively, or simply more clearly about the facts, you’ll be able to evaluate all possible reasons you can think of, not just the negative ones.  In other words, you’ll be doing more of: “I don’t know why he hasn’t called yet, but maybe… he’s actually extremely busy at work today.” To change your thinking, it helps to have a crystal-clear understanding of what you’re thinking in the first place.  When a troubling (negative) thought arises in your mind, instead of ignoring it, pay closer attention and then record it.  For example, if you’re sitting at your desk and you catch yourself ruminating about something negative, pause and write it down immediately.  Get that raw thought out of your head and down on paper—just a short sentence or two that honestly depicts the specific thought that’s presently troubling you: “I’m not good enough for the job I’m applying for because I don’t have enough experience.” Then, identify what triggered the thought.  Again, be brief and specific: “I’m new to the industry, and therefore I’m feeling out of my comfort zone.” At the very least, this process of evaluating your negative thoughts and their underlying triggers helps bring a healthy, objective awareness to the sources of your negativity or anxiety, which ultimately allows you to shift your mindset and take the next positive step forward. All journeys of positive change begin with a goal and the determination needed to achieve it.  However, what do you think happens when you are too determined, or too obsessed, with a goal?  You begin to nurture another belief: who you are right now is not good enough. A few months ago, one of our new Getting Back to Happy course students had become overly obsessive in her efforts to meditate.  As her interest in meditation grew, she began to increasingly say to herself, “I am not good enough,” and, “I have to be better at this.”  She began to notice various imperfections within herself that needed to be “fixed.” In a nutshell, her over-the-top efforts to meditate for extensive periods of time had opened the doors to lots of unexpected self-criticism and stress.  Thankfully, with a little coaching from Angel and me, she eventually realized her obsession toward meditation had made her forget one of the basic objectives of meditation—self-acceptance. So, the bottom line is this: you have to accept yourself as you are, and then commit to personal growth.  If you think you are absolutely “perfect” already, you will not make any positive efforts to grow.  But, constantly criticizing yourself is just as counterproductive as doing nothing, because you will never be able to build new positive changes into your life when you’re obsessively focused on your flaws. The key is to remind yourself that you already are good enough; you just need more practice.  Change your mantra from, “I have to be better,” to, “I will do my absolute best today.”  The second mantra is far more effective, because it actually prompts you to take positive action at any given moment while simultaneously accepting the reality that every effort may not be perfect. Being able to distinguish between healthy striving and self-abuse on your journey is another critically important step towards living a happier and more successful life. There’s a quote I’ve always loved that’s often credited to Ignatius: “Pray as if God will take care of all; act as if all is up to you.” That’s such a strong way to live!  It’s about using your faith to fuel positive thinking and positive action, every single day.  I sincerely strive for this in my own life.  And, I sincerely wish this for YOU. It’s important to note, too, that replacing your negativity with positivity isn’t about turning off all your negative thoughts—that’s nearly impossible because negative thoughts typically arise spontaneously and uncontrollably.  It’s also not about turning your false negative thoughts into false positive ones.  The goal is to reframe negative thoughts effectively, so they are based entirely in reality, detached from needless drama, and focused on the next positive step forward that can be taken in the present moment. The five methods covered above provide solid starting points. Challenge yourself to START, today!

I know because I’ve been there. Honestly, we’ve all been there at times. But, what can we learn from our trials?  A whole lot! There’s so much about our lives—and our fate—we can’t control, it makes absolutely no sense to focus all our energy on these things and then neglect everything we CAN control.  We can decide how we spend our time right now, what we choose to focus on, and whom we share our energy with.  We can choose our words and the tone of voice in which we speak to ourselves and others.  We can decide what we will engage in, read and study next.  We can choose how we’re going to respond to challenging life situations when they arise, and whether we will see them as curses or opportunities for growth… And most importantly, we can choose our attitude, which influences pretty much everything else. Of course, none of us are immune to occasional mood swings.  But that doesn’t mean we have to succumb to them.  Whether your negative attitude is a common occurrence or just a sporadic phenomenon, it’s critical for your long-term happiness and success that you choose to recognize when your mind is in the gutter, and then consciously make adjustments. Here are some hard things you need to hear and learn about your attitude (these are the most common attitude issues we’ve seen plaguing our newest course students over the years) and some tips to get you thinking straight again: If you’re feeling up to it, I’d love for you to openly reflect on your attitude: In other words, think carefully about that specific area of your life and what’s been troubling your mind, and then visualize how your life would be different if you made a positive shift in your attitude: Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

For nearly an hour I didn’t move.  I sat there in silence as she maintained a soft grip on my hand.  Then slowly, her grip loosened and her breathing slowed.  For a moment, I thought she was falling into a deeper sleep, but then her breathing stopped altogether. I let go of her lifeless hand and used the emergency call button to summon the nurse.  The nurse hustled in, covered the body with a white sheet, recorded a few notes on his tablet, and then began to offer his condolences… “I’m really sorry for your loss,” he said.  “Have you made any funeral arrangements?” “I don’t even know her name,” I replied. “What do you mean?” he asked.  “She’s your grandmother.” “No, she’s not,” I assured him.  “Prior to stepping foot in this room, I had never met her before in my life.  I’m here at the hospital waiting for my friend who needs a few stitches on his chin.” He looked confused.  “I don’t understand.  If you don’t know her, then why didn’t you say so?  And why did you sit beside her for the last hour?” I smiled.  “Well, I knew immediately that she wasn’t my grandmother.  But when you informed me of her story and life expectancy, I also knew that her real grandson, if he actually exists, wasn’t going to make it in time.  Curiosity got the best of me and I followed you into the room.  Then, when she saw me and smiled, I realized her vision was so blurred that she actually thought I was her grandson.  And knowing how desperate she was to see him, I decided to play the part and spend an hour with her.” Our lives are measured by the value we provide to others.  This value arises from the things we spend our time doing.  And since time is quantified in hours, the value of our lives is equivalent to the sum of every hour we spend. Opportunities to provide value are everywhere.  Some of them are anticipated, while others blindside us at midnight on an idle Tuesday.  Whether or not we choose to acknowledge and engage in these opportunities is up to us. How have you spent the last hour of your life? Let this question sink in.  Let it inspire you… Let yourself come to see just how precious a gift it is to find value in the loving gestures you display, the genuine conversations you have, the meaningful collaborations you engage in, and the deeds you do that bring peace. If you need a little extra inspiration in the upcoming hour, here are a few timeless strategies Angel and I personally practice, and often cover with our new course students: One hour at a time, one value-driven decision at a time.  That’s all we’re really talking about here.  Just maximizing the significance of our short lives, and making a small difference along the way. Of course, doing so is often easier said than done.  Distractions and counter-rationalities are everywhere.  “Reasons” to do the opposite of the five aforementioned points are abundant when we’re looking for them.  Filling an hour with the same old routines and responses, for example, always seems more comfortable in the near-term. But, the truth always rears its head in the end.  And the truth is, twenty years from now it won’t really matter how comfortable our lives were today, how easy we had it, or what we were “working on” when we were really just holding out on people.  Being perfectly in line and on time every second won’t matter either.  What will matter is how we lived, how we loved, and what we learned along the way. It’s our time, right now… To fill an hour with true value. To instill as much love, kindness and compassion into it as possible. And to do what we know in our heads and hearts is right, every step of the way. Let’s practice, together, for all the right reasons.  🙂 Some of the strategies above (like numbers 3 and 5 for example) potentially require a willingness to amicably deal with people who yell at us, interrupt us, talk about remarkably distasteful things, and so forth.  These people violate the way we think people should behave, and sometimes their behavior deeply offends us.  But if we let these people get to us—if we let them incapacitate our minds with negativity—we lose our ability to see and provide value. So, what can we do if we have someone like this in our lives right now? We can challenge ourselves to mentally hug them and wish them well in the hour ahead, no matter what. This isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution, but it’s a little trick that can positively change the way we see most people who offend us.  Let’s say someone has just said something unpleasant to us.  How dare they!  Who do they think they are?  They have no consideration for our feelings!  But of course, with a heated reaction like this, we’re not having any consideration for their feelings either—they may be suffering inside in unimaginable ways.  By remembering this, we can try to show them empathy, and realize that their behavior is likely driven by some kind of inner pain.  They are being unpleasant as a coping mechanism for their pain. And so, mentally, we can give them a hug.  We can have compassion for this broken person, because we all have been broken and in pain at some point in our lives.  We’re the same in many ways.  Sometimes we need a hug, some extra compassion, and a little unexpected love. Try this.  See the immediate value in your gentle response.  And then smile in serenity, armed with the reassuring knowledge that you did your best, and you didn’t let someone else’s behavior turn you into someone you aren’t.

Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, or call it a family.  Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one.  You need a small group of people in your life that lift you higher. As Anaïs Nin so profoundly said, “Each friend represents a world in us, a world possibly not born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born.” So right here, right now, make it a goal to spend more time with nice people who are smart, driven and like-minded.  Remember that relationships should help you, not hurt you.  Surround yourself with people who reflect the person you want to be.  Choose friends who you are proud to know, people you admire, who love and respect you – people who make your day a little brighter simply by being in it. Ultimately, the people in your life make all the difference in the person YOU are capable of being. And life is just too short to spend time with people who suck the happiness out of you.  When you free yourself from negative people, or simply the wrong people, you free yourself to be YOU – and being YOU is the only way to truly live. Thus, it’s time to remind yourself of these… If you feel like your relationships have been suffering, or if you hope to build new healthy relationships, read on.  Angel and I have spent more than a decade working with individuals and couples through our course and coaching, and the three strategies briefly covered below are game-changers!  I encourage you to implement them, gradually, one at a time, into your life.  And if you need further assistance, we’re here. Ironically, the prerequisite to building healthy relationships is being comfortable when you’re all by yourself.  If you’re starting fresh, with a minimal number of friends in your immediate vicinity, the reason for this is obvious: spending time alone is your only option.  Likewise, if you have friends that have been dragging you down and negatively impacting your life, withdrawing from them and starting anew will likely require a bit more alone time. Appreciating solitude starts with the conscious awareness of the freedom it brings.  When you enjoy your own company you don’t need others around for the sake of having others around.  You can be flexible about who you choose to spend time with, instead of letting your fear of being alone suck you into social situations and relationships that aren’t right for you. The healthiest relationships are comprised of two people who are intimately familiar with each other’s evolving stories.  These people make plenty of emotional room for their relationship, which means they sincerely listen to each other, they remember the major events each other have been through, and they keep up-to-date as the facts and feelings of each other’s reality changes. The key thing to remember is that nothing you can give is more appreciated than your sincere, focused attention – your full presence.  Being with someone, listening without a clock and without anticipation of the next event is the ultimate compliment.  It is indeed the most valued gesture you can make to them, and it arms you with the information you need to truly know them and support them in the long run.  (Angel and I build mindful relationship rituals with our students in the “Love and Relationships” module of Getting Back to Happy.) If there are one or two people you already know who you would like to strengthen your relationship with, try to find a way to work together on something that intrigues both of you.  You could plant a communal garden together, or meet once a week to complete unfinished projects – such as a writing, painting or website project.  Working with others on meaningful projects can help you strengthen your bonds with them. Attending a life-enhancing conference together (live or virtual), and then mindfully examining and discussing it, is another related opportunity for working together on something meaningful.  (Note: The title photo at the top of this article was captured at our annual Think Better, Live Better conference.  Next February we’re hosting it in San Diego.) If you’re up to it, we’d love it if you shared something you’ve personally learned about the importance of spending time with the right people. How have your healthy relationships helped you?

"4 Things Most of Us Refuse to Admit About Ourselves|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/4-refuse-to-admit.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| May your actions speak louder than your words. May your life preach louder than your lips. May your success be your noise in the end. The result of enormous success is often pretty noisy — lots of people talking, writing, and sharing stories about it. The actual process of achieving enormous success, on the other hand, is far more discreet. But it’s this process that happens quietly, behind-the-scenes, that makes all the difference in the world. Marc and I are fortunate enough to know a number of enormously successful human beings. Regardless of lifestyle, industry or profession, they share many of the same quiet habits. And that’s precisely what I want to discuss with you today. Here are twelve key things the most successful people we know do quietly and diligently: [Read more…]  Let’s cut to the chase today. What you ultimately do in life comes out of who you believe you are. You have to practice believing in yourself and ignoring the naysayers. Because while you may not be able to control the impolite and unfair things some people say and do, you can press forward and decide not to be endlessly derailed by them. Of course, I know that’s all much easier said than done, but you must remind yourself that it can be done! How? Start by leveraging the right daily affirmations. After all, it’s not what others say about you, and it’s not what you broadcast to everyone else that determines the trajectory of your life. It’s what you whisper to yourself behind [Read more…]  You ultimately become what you repeatedly do. If your habits aren’t helping you, they’re hurting you. Here are some fairly common and widespread examples of the latter that will drain all your joy if you let them: Try to use frustration and inconvenience to motivate you rather than annoy you. You are in control of the way you look at life. Instead of getting angry, find the lesson. In place of envy, feel admiration. In place of worry, take action. In place of doubt, have faith. Remember that your response is always more powerful than your present circumstance. A small part of your life is decided by completely uncontrollable circumstances, while the vast majority of your life is decided by your responses. Where you ultimately end up is heavily dependent on [Read more…]  A good morning, and thus a good day, aren’t just experiences that magically happen — they are created consciously. Most of us are distracted from the get-go every morning. Trivial activities like checking social media, watching TV, and worrying about things we can’t control often set the tone of the day. And that means we waste our most well-rested time on things that don’t matter, while gradually losing touch with the significant, controllable parts of our lives that actually do matter. We simply forget that the morning hours are enormously important — they form the foundation from which the day is built. We forget that how we choose to spend these hours can be used to predict the kind of days we’re going to have, and ultimately the kind of lives we’re going to live. So if you feel like you’ve been getting a rough start lately, and stumbling through your days with diminished intention and focus, it’s time to consider [Read more…]  Perhaps it takes courage to raise children… Our youth can’t possibly know how age thinks and feels. And likewise, as we age we are often guilty of being so busy-brained that we forget what it was like to be young. Spending time with my young son helps me tap into my younger mind — he keeps me on my toes. For that I am grateful, but I still struggle as a parent. I struggle to be present. I struggle to be patient. I struggle to remember. Almost every single day. Truth be told, every parent battles with parenthood in their own way. Because parenting is not easy. What helps me is journaling about the lessons parenthood is gradually teaching me, and then referring back to what I’ve learned when I’m struggling and forgetful. Today, I want to share some quotes from my parenting journal with you. Perhaps they will assist you someday, the way they have assisted me again this morning… [Read more…] One Hard Thing You Must Start Doing (To Stop Being Your Own Worst Enemy)|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/one-hard-worst-enemy.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| A petite, light-skinned Jamaican woman sits with her husband in a crowded beachside ice cream shop in Miami.  Although she doesn’t speak loudly or occupy much space in the room, people notice her. Her hair is long, flowing and black like a windy night.  Her lips are soft and red like rose petals.  Her curves are subtle, yet they dip and bend in all the right places.  Her skin is smooth, brown, maple cream.  And her clothes are modest, accentuating everything, while exposing nothing at all. She knows why they’re looking at her.  “It’s because I’m not white,” she says.  “It’s because we’re an interracial couple and they don’t understand why you’re with me.” Her husband groans and closes his eyes.  There’s nothing he can say.  They’ve already had this conversation a hundred times before.  He threads his fingers through his hair in frustration and watches as his chocolate ice cream begins to melt. Three tables over, two Latino college kids eat their ice cream cones and check out “the scene.”  As usual, they’re not impressed.  The women around here are too old, too young, too overweight, or…, “Wow, look at her,” the pimple-faced one says as he nods his head towards the Jamaican woman. The prematurely balding one turns around to look.  “Oh yeah, she must be a model,” he replies.  “She’s way out of our league, bud…” “I don’t think I should have to explain why this is so painful for me,” the Jamaican woman continues.  “The media portrays white, blonde females as the essence of beauty and perfection.  My color is simply a genetic defect.” A chubby Asian girl, about 12-years-old, naively stares at the Jamaican woman while sipping a root beer float.  Small tears stream down her face.  “Daddy, why can’t I be as pretty as her?” she asks her father. “It doesn’t matter if you’re physically faithful to me,” the Jamaican woman says to her husband.  “Because with all these influences surrounding you, you’re probably internalizing your deep desires for a genetically endowed female companion.  And it kills me!  Don’t you understand?” “Please honey… Are you ready to go home?” her husband replies softly.  She hasn’t taken a single bite of her brownie sundae and all of the ice cream has already melted.  She sighs and stands up, weakly. Three well-dressed white women in their early 30’s talk cheerfully and sip diet cokes at a table near the door.  They were all childhood friends at a local orphanage.  When they were eventually placed in different foster homes, they lost contact with each other.  This special reunion is their first time together in almost twenty years. “Did you see those three women by the door?” the Jamaican woman asks her husband as they walk to their car.  “Wealthy white women like that don’t even appreciate how easy their life has been.” It might seem a bit ironic, or perhaps even downright bold, that a white man would write a story about a beautiful Jamaican woman who is heartbroken and tormented inside by her self-image.  But it’s really not that ironic or bold at all.  That Jamaican woman is a dear friend of mine, and she asked me to share a piece of her story with you today.  Last night she called me in tears and opened up about how she desperately struggles with her inner demons. She told me she was unfairly judged and disrespected in the distant past, and that she’s now allowing those past experiences to haunt her daily.  “I’ve lost my inner compass,” she said.  “I hold on tightly to the shallow opinions of timeworn characters in my past that don’t deserve any piece of me.  And I’ve let their judgments become my own.  More often than not, I am the one judging myself these days.  This is how I think.  This is how I live—in a constant mental state of inadequacy.  I am now my own worst enemy!  And it’s driving me, and my husband, crazy!”  And then, over the course of nearly two hours, through intermittent moments of silence and sobbing, she described that heartbreaking scene in the ice cream shop. Now, there are admittedly many ways to dissect my friend’s story, but I want you to think for a moment about how her feelings of inadequacy relate to you and your life. Truth be told, all of us, to a greater or lesser extent, suffer in precisely the way my friend does.  There isn’t a person among us who doesn’t have insecurities—some of us are just better at coping with them, or perhaps hiding them. We worry about what other people think of us.  We worry about our appearance.  We worry if she’ll like us.  We worry if he likes that other woman.  We worry that we’re not accomplishing all that we should be.  We worry that we’ll fall flat on our faces.  We worry that we’re not enough just the way we are.  And of course, we worry about all those foolish, thoughtless things someone once said about us. And social media—with its culture of getting us to seek constant approval with virtual likes and hearts—with its endless highlight reel of perfect bodies and epic travels—it only intensifies the problem. Think about it.  How often has a lack of self-confidence, or a feeling of inadequacy, stopped you or someone you love? I would guess that, for many of us, feelings of inadequacy have stopped us from: I’ve experienced all of that and then some.  In fact, at an early age, when I was just a freshman in high school and struggling to find my way, someone anonymously slipped a note into my locker one afternoon.  It said, “Don’t let them get inside your head.  You’re not boring, nerdy or weird.  You’re complex, creative and far too sharp for their small words.  And for the record, you are also infinitely more attractive than you give yourself credit for.”  Although I never discovered who wrote the note, I still have it sitting in my desk drawer to this day, and I read it sometimes when I need a reminder. Last night I did my best to covey a similar reminder to my friend.  But she wanted to know more… “How do I actually overcome my insecurities?” she asked.  “How do I finally become OK with myself again?” The answer I gave was somewhat simple, but far from easy… It’s perhaps the hardest thing we all need to do for ourselves. We need to NOT be our own worst enemies when it comes to self-image. But that takes practice.  Lots of it… When it comes to feeling better about ourselves, and our place in the world, the biggest and most complex obstacle we have to overcome is our mind.  If we can overcome that, we can overcome almost anything life throws at us. The key is in accepting the fact that while we can’t control exactly what happens in life, we CAN control how we respond to it all.  And in our response is our power to grow and move forward. One of our first Getting Back to Happy students, who graduated with a PhD last year from one of the most prestigious universities in our country, is now an executive for one of the world’s fastest growing tech companies.  Throughout grade school and high school she desperately wrestled with a form of dyslexia that made reading and writing a monumental challenge.  She spent kindergarten through 12th grade in language-based ESE classes.  And during a parent-teacher conference when she was in 9th grade, one of her ESE teachers informed her parents that it was extremely unlikely she would ever receive a high school diploma. So how did she do it?  How did she push herself to rise up and overcome the odds?  “A mindset shift,” she confirmed with me when I interviewed her recently for a side project Angel and I are working on.  “The mindset tools you and Angel set me up with, and held me accountable to, changed everything!  I literally learned to tell myself that the naysayers were wrong about me.  And I learned to stop naysaying myself too.  I changed my mental story—my mental movie—and I started telling myself exactly what I needed to hear, every single day, to move my life forward.” Ready to move your life forward too? While there isn’t a one-size-fits-all way of changing your “mental movie”—because, to an extent, we all have unique stories and past experiences—there are some foundational steps Angel and I often guide our course students and coaching clients through: And if you need a little extra assistance with re-scripting your mental movie in the heat of the moment, you can use the simple phrase “The story I’m telling myself…” as a prefix to any self-deprecating thought.  Here’s how it works… Perhaps someone you just met didn’t call you when they said they would, and now you’re thinking, “They forgot about me because I’m not good enough for them.”  When you catch yourself feeling this way, use the phrase: “The story I’m telling myself is that they didn’t call me simply because I’m not good enough for them.” Then ask yourself: Give yourself the space to think it through carefully.  Mull it over, mindfully. On the average day, I bet your answer to question #1 is “no,” and your answer to question #2 is “not very good.”  And I hope question #3 gives you the perspective you need to write a better script. In closing, let me lighten the mood and leave you with this… A puppy thinks: “Hey, these people I live with feed me, love me, provide me with a warm, dry home, pet me and take good care of me… … THEY MUST BE GODS!”  A kitten thinks: “Hey, these people I live with feed me, love me, provide me with a warm, dry home, pet me and take good care of me… … I MUST BE A GOD!” Same situation, different thinking. To a great extent, we make our life stories by our thoughts. The reality we ultimately live is a process of our daily thinking. And when we think better about ourselves, we live better in spite of ourselves. We would love to hear from YOU.

Severn boldly set her sights on attending the next United Nations (UN) Conference.  At the time, in over 50 years, no child had ever attended a UN Conference—a formal meeting where ambassadors from nearly every developed country come together to openly discuss the future health of the world.  But Severn believed it was time to change this—it was time for children to have a voice too.  So not only was she determined to figure out how to attend, but she resolved to make sure her voice was heard loud and clear too. Severn applied to attend the UN Conference through the environmental non-profit she and her friends founded when they were all just 9-years-old.  And when her application was accepted—not because of her age, but because she had helped build a relevant non-profit—she knew it was just the beginning. When Severn arrived at the UN Conference she hit the ground running with one goal in mind: to find an opportunity to publicly convey her message about the importance of children being a part of the UN’s global conversation.  Quickly, she learned that one of the scheduled speakers was unable to attend the conference.  So she volunteered to replace that speaker.  And although there was some initial reluctance, her offer was ultimately accepted. A few days later she stood on stage, utterly nervous, looked out over a room filled with ambassadors from around the world and began speaking in a clear, steady voice.  She may have been just 12-years-old, and she may have felt out of her element, but her air of authority and passion were unmistakable: “I’m only a child, and I don’t have all the solutions.  But I want you to realize, neither do you.” When Severn wrapped up her speech and exited the stage, the ambassadors gave her a standing ovation.  But more importantly, they heard her, and they took action.  At the next UN Conference on Environment and Development children were invited to attend and participate.  And it all happened because one 12-year-old girl had the courage and tenacity to stand up for her right to be heard. In a nutshell, that’s the power of good communication! And although Severn’s story is just one interesting example of how good communication can be leveraged, let it inspire you to think about all the other incredible possibilities that can bloom when someone, of any age or stature, stands up and speaks intelligently from their heart. With all the aforementioned said, keep in mind that constantly talking and challenging others isn’t communicating.  It’s just drama. You are as powerful as the meaningful ideas you share with others, and you are as wise as the selective silence you leave behind. Think of Severn Suzuki again.  She didn’t just speak—she had something decisive and meaningful to say. So do your best to be wise with your words.  There is a time to speak up and a time to remain quiet.  Knowledge is knowing what to say.  Wisdom is knowing whether or not to say it. Of course, the “wisdom” of striking the right balance will take practice, and that’s OK.  Just speak from your heart and soul—with kindness and the intention to add value—and you will gradually learn not to waste words on moments that deserve your silence. In closing, I like to lighten the mood and leave you with a joke on communication recently told by Ellen DeGeneres: “Not only have we given up on writing letters to each other, we barely even talk to each other these days.  People have become so accustomed to texting that they’re actually startled when the phone rings.  It’s like we suddenly all have Batphones.  If it rings, there must be danger. Now we answer, “What happened?  Is someone tied up in the old sawmill?” “No, it’s Becky.  I just called to say hi.” “Well you scared me half to death.  You can’t just pick up the phone and try to talk to me like that.  Don’t the tips of your fingers work?” 🙂 So, at the very least, I hope this article inspires you to speak up by picking up the phone today, just to say something meaningful to someone you care about. But before you go, please share your thoughts in the comments section below. Which point above resonated the most, and why?

Mac suddenly spoke up.  “They ran away when I started crying,” he said through his tears. I thanked the teenage girl, picked Mac up, and carried him to a nearby picnic table.  Initially, even though I was fuming inside, I just wanted to cheer Mac up.  So I quickly told him a few of my favorite kid-friendly jokes until, thankfully, I was able to get a genuine giggle out of him.  Then I pulled two dark chocolate bars out of my pocket, handed one to him, and said, “Cheers!”  He smiled and gave me a huge hug.  And I relaxed a bit, knowing that he was sincerely feeling better. A few minutes later I asked Mac what bothered him most about what had happened on the playground.  Even though he’s only three years old, I know Mac is a tough kid who’s incredibly well spoken and mature for his age.  He usually doesn’t cry, or even pay much attention, when random bullies start misbehaving and acting foolishly. “I don’t smell and I didn’t poop in my pants,” he explained.  “But those two mean bullies lied about me, and everybody looked at me with a yucky face and believed them.  Then nobody wanted to play with me; I had no friends.” Again, tears started welling up in his eyes.  And again, my heart began to ache and race.  I could feel Mac’s pain.  I’ve certainly felt his kind of pain in my own life too.  And just as I was about to tell Mac it was time to teach those two bullies a lesson they’d never forget, I remembered the words of my late grandmother.  Many moons ago, when I was going through a similar situation in elementary school, she told me, “Those bullies just want to make you feel bad all day long.  That’s their goal.  And if you continue to feel bad about their foolish antics, they win.  However, if you let go of their foolish antics, and instead focus on feeling good and helping other people feel good, you win.  There’s always a winner in these situations.  And it’s always your choice.” I did my best to gracefully reiterate my grandmother’s wisdom to Mac.  And he sat quietly and listened intently, as his tears gradually dried up.  Then he gave me another huge hug and said, “Thank you, Daddy.  I feel good now.  I win!” Regardless of our age or social status, there will always be some difficult people out there who want nothing more than to bully and belittle us.  Sometimes they’re colleagues at work, sometimes they’re people in our neighborhoods, sometimes they’re those mean kids on the playground… And just as difficult people will always exist in the world, so too will our power to choose how we respond to them.  Do we let them make their pain our own?  Or do we choose to transform that pain into personal growth and strength?  Do we let them win?  Or do we choose to win? It’s hard to make wise choices in the heat of the moment.  But when we choose to win and transform pain into personal growth and strength, we aren’t just improving our own lives, we’re also improving the lives of the people we love, and the people who look up to us. With that said, however, sometimes handling difficult people—and “winning”—is, well, difficult!  Angel and I have worked with hundreds of course students and coaching clients over the past decade who were struggling through this very predicament.  And gradually, we guided them through several smart yet simple strategies that work wonders.  I want to briefly review a few of these strategies with you today, in hopes that you find value in them too… It doesn’t help to tame all the difficult people in your life if you’re not ready to foster genuine relationships with good people.  On occasion, you may find that the difficulties between you and someone else drain away rather quickly when you start being less difficult yourself.  Honestly, I’m not trying to preach; this is something I’m working on in my own life—it’s a lifelong practice. Make that first call, offer a genuine compliment, schedule a fun outing with another person’s preferences in mind, send that ridiculously funny text message for no real reason—there are tons of ways to nurture relationships with good people who are worth the extra effort and sacrifice.  And when good people and good intentions surround you, it’s amazing how unnecessary pettiness, toxicity, and difficulty simply evaporates from your conscious awareness. This really goes back to the point above on modeling the behavior you want to see.  Just as light will dispel darkness, your light can be a shining example to everyone around you…including those who mean well but don’t realize their difficult tendencies.  And even though you’ll likely need to limit your exposure to some people, don’t underestimate the possibility that your example may influence them for the greater good, one way or the other, in the long run. How have difficult people affected your life and relationships?  Do you have any additional thoughts or insights to share?  We would love to hear from you.  Please leave a reply below.

During a recent research experiment in the Caribbean, a marine biologist placed a sizeable shark into a large holding tank and then released several small bait fish into the tank with it. As you might expect, the shark quickly darted around the tank attacking and eating the smaller bait fish. The following day the marine biologist inserted a strong piece of clear fiberglass into the tank, creating two separate partitions.  She then put the shark on one side of the fiberglass divider and a new set of bait fish on the other. Again, the shark quickly attacked.  This time, however, the shark slammed into the fiberglass divider and bounced off.  Undeterred, the shark kept repeating this behavior every few minutes to no avail.  Meanwhile, the bait fish swam around unharmed in the second partition.  Eventually, about an hour into the experiment, the shark gave up. This experiment was repeated several dozen times over the next few weeks.  Each time, the shark got less aggressive and made fewer attempts to attack the bait fish, until eventually the shark got tired of hitting the fiberglass divider and simply stopped attacking altogether. The marine biologist then removed the fiberglass divider, but the shark didn’t attack.  The shark was trained to believe a barrier existed between it and the bait fish, so the bait fish swam wherever they wished, free from harm. Why am I telling you this story? Many of us, after experiencing setbacks and failures, emotionally give up and stop trying.  Like the shark in the story, we believe that because we were unsuccessful in the past, we will always be unsuccessful.  In other words, we continue to see a barrier in our heads, even when no real barrier exists between where we are and where we want to go. Let this be your wake-up call. We all have incredible power inside us.  Certainly, we also have our own fiberglass dividers—the self-limiting thoughts and beliefs that hold us back.  Sometimes it’s a childhood experience or an old failure.  Sometimes it’s something we were told when we were a little younger.  Sometimes it’s just a lack of self-confidence that gradually sneaks up on us over the years. In any case, here’s what you need to know and remember… “This afternoon I found out I had been accepted to the university of my choice with a full track and field scholarship.  Despite everything my alcoholic mother and her abusive husband put me through over the years—the hungry, sleepless nights I spent in tears due to their relentless negativity—it didn’t ruin me.  With your coaching and guidance, I’ve worked hard to get out of this mess once and for all, and it’s finally paying off.” That’s the opening paragraph of an email we received back in March from Monica, a course student of ours (she gave me permission to share this with you today).  Her email goes on to say that she has forgiven her mom and stepfather, but also knows being on her own and taking this next step is a priceless gift.  “Honestly, for far too long the people in my life had me convinced that I wasn’t good enough,” she says.  “And I have no grudges, but I’m so happy I’m able to prove to myself that they were wrong about me all along.” Monica’s email made me pause, reflect and smile, for obvious reasons. And although Monica’s circumstances are unique to her, I bet you can relate on some level.  I know I can.  Sometimes the pressure and dysfunction coming from family, peers, work, and society in general is enough to make us feel completely broken inside.  If we do things differently, we’re looked down upon.  If we dream big, we’re ridiculed.  Or if we don’t have the ‘right’ job, relationship, lifestyle, and so forth, by a certain age or time frame, we’re somehow made to feel like we’re not good enough. Monica’s story truly is a perfect reminder for all of us, even though she’s only 18, because the self-limiting beliefs that get instilled in our minds often arrive at an early age. Maybe we got cut from a sports team as a child and thus determined “I’m not athletic enough to be fit and good at sports.”  Or a college boyfriend or girlfriend breaks up with us out of the blue and then immediately starts dating someone else, and so we feel unwanted and unattractive … for way too long. For whatever reason, we encounter seemingly insignificant rejections that drastically alter our mindset for years to come.  It happens something like this: Does that sound at all familiar? If so, it’s time to break yourself out of this cycle! How? By proving to yourself that the belief holding you back is toxic and FALSE… I want you to think about ONE toxic belief you have.  It can be about any part of your life you hope to change—your health, your weight, your career, your relationships—anything at all.  What’s one thing you’ve essentially decided is a fact about your place on Earth? And then I want you to immediately shift gears and think about ONE time—one fleeting moment—in which the opposite of that ‘fact’ was true for you.  I don’t care how tiny of a victory it was, or even if it was a partial victory.  What’s one moment in time you can look back on and say, “Hey, that was totally unlike me, but I did it”? Once you identify the cracks in the wall of a self-limiting, toxic belief, you can start attacking it.  You can start taking steps forward every day that go against it—tiny victories, more confidence, gradual momentum, bigger victories, even more confidence, and so on. Until your thoughts and reality change for good.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Adversity” chapter of our book.) All too often we let the rejections of our past dictate every move we make.  This is one of the most common and damaging thought patterns we as human beings succumb to.  We literally do not know ourselves to be any better than what some opinionated person or limited occurrence once told us was true.  And so we get used to looking around and thinking things will never work out in our favor. Realize this! Practice noticing your negative attachments to past experiences, so you can learn from these experiences and then update your belief system based on how your circumstances have changed (as they continuously do). In other words, you need to practice thinking better about the past and present, so you can ultimately live better from here on out. One of the most effective ways of doing this involves catching and correcting your negative (false) pattern-matching tendencies.  Let me explain… Every day, all day, you are subconsciously matching patterns from the past with the present (this is why you’re able to recognize familiar places and people).  When an experience in your life has emotional significance, it gets tagged in your brain as being important.  And when the emotional experience is upsetting, it triggers your brain’s fear mechanism, which tells your brain to remain on the lookout for any future conditions that vaguely remind you of this upsetting experience (it does this to protect you from future harm). Your brain then tries to match new experiences with the original one.  But depending on how emotionally attached you are to the original experience, it can lead to false pattern matches which inevitably lead you astray.  This is especially true when it comes to personal failures, mistakes and misjudgments. For example: Again, these false pattern matches occur whenever you respond negatively and over-emotionally to a particular past experience.  And it all happens subconsciously too.  Logically, you know that all relationships are completely different, but emotionally you are inclined to respond as if they are all alike. If you feel stuck because you can’t move beyond a negative experience from the past, then your brain is subconsciously relating to it as if it’s still happening right now, which means it’s matching patterns improperly in the present.  Here’s a (simplified) two-step solution that might help: Just because someone else can, doesn’t mean you can, right?  Because you’re not good enough, or you’ve already missed your chance, or it’s just not in the cards for you.  You look for reasons they can do it but you can’t… OK, fine, it’s easy to find excuses: but look at all the other people who also have considerable obstacles and have done it anyway.  Angel and I have a family, and have coped with significant loss in our lives, and still managed to succeed on many fronts.  And just as we’ve turned things around for ourselves, we know hundreds of other people who’ve done the same.  Through a decade of life coaching with our students and clients, we’ve witnessed people reinventing themselves at all ages—48-year olds starting families, 57-year-olds graduating from college for the first time, 71-year-olds starting successful businesses, and so forth.  And stories abound of people with disabilities or illnesses who overcame their obstacles to achieve incredible outcomes. Your obstacles CAN be overcome! Feeling stuck and incapable is a FEELING, not a fact.  So never assume that you’re stuck with the way things are.  Life changes, and so can you.  It’s never too late to live a life that makes you proud.  If you don’t learn anything else from this post, learn that.   There’s no age limit on changing your course. “But how?” you ask. By putting one foot in front of the other every single day. When it comes to making a meaningful change in your life—earning a new degree, building a new business, fostering a new relationship, starting a family, becoming more mindful, or any other personal journey that takes time and commitment—you have to build daily rituals into your life that reinforce your goal, so you can actually make real, lasting progress. Because goals don’t make positive changes happen, daily rituals do. Watch this quick video Angel and I recorded for you, and let us explain…  (Note: Angel and I build small, daily, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.) I hope you found value in the three strategies above.  I’ve shared them with you because, honestly, I’ve witnessed them help hundreds of our course students and coaching clients over the past decade. And it’s important to note, too, that Angel and I are not immune to any of this.  None of us are above this stuff.  Just like every other human being, sometimes we let our negative thoughts and beliefs get the best of us—we let our inner conflicts get in the way of our real world opportunities.  And it takes practice just to realize this, and then even more practice to get back on track. Which is precisely why we practice a little bit every day. I hope you will join us today. To think better. And to live better. If you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU. Which point mentioned above resonates with you the most today, and why? What beliefs do you need to move on from? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

The mind can go either direction under stress – toward the positive or toward the negative: on or off.  Think of it as a binary spectrum, where the opposite ends are unconsciousness at the negative end and presence at the positive end.  The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by emotional strength and training. Over the years, Marc and I have come across, studied and tested dozens of strategies that successful people employ when faced with stress, but in today’s video blog we want to tell you about six of the most effective strategies we’ve seen in action.  A couple of these strategies may seem obvious, but the real challenge lies in recognizing when you need to use them, and having the discipline to actually do so in spite of your stress.  Let’s take a look…  The ability to manage stress when you’re under pressure directly affects your overall performance in all walks of life.  In fact, several scientific studies over the years have found that successful people, in various fields of study, are highly skilled at managing their emotions in times of stress in order to remain calm and in control. There’s actually new research out of Cal Berkeley that reveals an upside to experiencing momentary stress, and then reinforces how important it is to keep long-term stress under control.  The recent study found that the onset of stress challenges the brain into growing new cells responsible for improved memory and cognitive ability.  However, this effect is only seen when stress is temporary.  As soon as the stress continues beyond a few moments into a prolonged state, it actually interferes with the brain’s ability to function and grow new cells.  Kind of scary, isn’t it? And there’s more to the story too.  Besides decreasing your brain cells and intellectual performance, stress also increases your risk of heart disease and depression.  Fortunately, though, unless a grizzly bear is chasing you, the bulk of your stress is unnecessary and under your control.  Successful people have well-honed coping strategies that they employ in stressful situations.  This lowers their stress levels regardless of what’s happening in their environment, ensuring that the stress they experience is temporary and not prolonged. Again, Marc and I have relentlessly studied and tested dozens of strategies that we’ve witnessed successful people use when faced with stress.  Here are the stress-reducing rituals the most successful people we know live by: A big step in managing stress involves stopping negative self-talk dead in its tracks. The more you ruminate on negative thoughts, the more power they have over you.  And most of our negative thoughts are just that – thoughts, not facts.  When you find yourself believing the pessimistic things your subconscious mind says, stop and take a deep breath.  Then ask yourself:  “Are these negative thoughts true?  Are they facts?”  Once you’ve taken a few moments to slow down the momentum of your negative thinking, you will be more rational and clear-headed in evaluating the reality of the situation. Sometimes you have to give your wandering mind a little help by consciously selecting something positive to think about.  Any positive thought will do to refocus your attention.  When things are going well, and you’re in a good mood, this is fairly easy.  When times are tough, however, and your mind is flooded with negativity, this can be a real challenge.  In these moments, think about your day and identify one positive thing that happened, no matter how small.  If you can’t think of something from today, reflect on the previous day or even another recent time. The point here is to have something positive, no matter how small, that you’re ready to shift your attention to when negativity starts stirring in your mind.  Even if you have to look a little harder than usual, it still exists.  (Read The Happiness Advantage.) These statements just fuel the fire of needless stress and worry.  In life, things can go in a billion different directions, and the more time you spend worrying about the missed opportunities (should haves) and negative possibilities (what ifs), the less time you’ll spend focusing on taking positive action that will calm you down and move you forward.  Successful people know that “should haves” and “what ifs” will only take them to an emotional state of mind they don’t want – or need – to be in.  (Marc and I cover this in detail in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.) It’s tempting, yet entirely ineffective, to do everything yourself.  To reduce stress and increase productivity, you need to recognize your weaknesses and ask for help, advice, or just a listening ear when you need it.  Something as simple as talking about your worries will help you overcome them.  Most of the time, other people can see a solution that you can’t because they’re not as emotionally invested in your unique situation. So remember, everyone has someone who is on their side, cheering for them, and ready to help them figure out a difficult life situation if and when it arises.  Identify who this person (or people) is in your life and make an effort to seek their insight and assistance when you need it most. They know mindful relaxation is the key to mental and physical recuperation.  There are many ways to do this, but the foundation of all of them is focused breathing (a form of meditation).  Your breath is the bridge between your life circumstances and your consciousness – it unites your body and your thoughts.  So when you’re feeling stressed, take a ten-minute break to sit quietly and focus on your breathing.  Close the door, put away all other distractions, and just sit in a chair with your eyes closed and breathe. The goal is to spend the entire time focused only on the feeling of your chest inhaling and exhaling, which will prevent your worried mind from wandering and overthinking.  This sounds simple, but it’s challenging to do for more than a minute or two, especially when you’re just starting out with this ritual.  And it’s perfectly fine if random thoughts sidetrack you – this is sure to happen, you just need to bring your focus back to your breathing. Bottom line:  Whenever your thoughts become scattered with the worries and stress of busyness, use your breath as a means to take hold of your mind.  Just breathe, and be present for a moment; you’ll feel better. Taking time every day to think about what you’re thankful for isn’t merely the “right” thing to do, it also helps you feel more relaxed and content, because it reduces the stress hormone cortisol by over 20%.  Research conducted at the University of California, Davis found that people who worked daily to openly express their appreciation and gratitude experienced improved moods, energy levels, and physical health, even during bouts of stress.  It’s highly likely that their lower cortisol levels played a major role in this.  (Marc and I discuss this in detail in the “Happiness” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) So there you have it, six stress-reducing rituals we’ve seen work wonders in the lives of some of the most successful people we’ve interacted with over the years.  If you feel like your life has been too stressful lately, it’s time to follow in their footsteps. Today we challenge you to apply one of these stress-reducing rituals to your routine.  Please leave us a comment below and let us know which ritual you want to implement in your life, AND one small step you can take TODAY to get started.

In most cases, problems like these are not caused not by a physical ailment, but by a weakness of the mind – a weakness that urges us to avoid discomfort. Discomfort is a form of pain, but it isn’t a deep pain – it’s a shallow one.  It’s the feeling you get when you’ve stepped outside of your comfort zone.  The idea of exercising in many people’s minds, for example, brings discomfort – so they don’t do it.   Eating green vegetables brings discomfort too.  So does meditating, or focusing on a difficult task, or saying no to others.  Of course, these are just examples, because different people find discomfort in different things, but you get the general idea. The bottom line is most of us don’t want to be uncomfortable.  So we run from discomfort constantly.  The problem with this is that, by running from discomfort, we are constrained to partake in only the activities and opportunities within our comfort zones.  And since our comfort zones are relativity small, we miss out on most of life’s greatest and healthiest experiences, and we get stuck in a debilitating cycle. Let’s use diet and exercise as an example… Amazingly, the simple act of accepting a little discomfort every day, and taking it one small step at a time, can solve most of our common problems, and make our minds happier, healthier and stronger in the long run. Now, let me give you some examples of how I’ve experienced this in my own life… Years ago, when I was incredibly focused on weight lifting and physical strength training, I gradually learned that you can’t be truly committed to any goal if you have a weak mind that’s unwilling to be uncomfortable.  To combat this, I wrote two simple questions on two different post-it notes and stuck one on my bathroom mirror and the other inside my gym locker: To this day, the answer to both questions is probably hundreds for most people, including myself.  Weakness of the mind is a real dream killer, and the only way to fix this weakness is daily practice. Far too often we think that mental strength is all about how we respond to extreme circumstances.  How did she perform on stage during that nationally televised event?  Did he bounce back after his business associate betrayed him and bankrupt their company?  Can she keep her life together even after suffering from a major, debilitating bodily injury? There’s no doubt that extreme circumstances test our bravery, determination and mental strength, but what about common, daily circumstances? Just like every muscle in the body, the mind needs to be exercised to gain strength.  It needs to be worked consistently to grow and develop over time.  If you haven’t pushed yourself in hundreds of little ways over time, of course you’ll crumble on the one day that things get really challenging. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Choose to go to the gym when it would be more comfortable to sleep in.  Choose to do the tenth rep when it would be more comfortable to quit at nine.  Choose to create something special when it would be more comfortable to consume something mediocre.  Choose to raise your hand and ask that extra question when it would be more comfortable to stay silent.  Prove to yourself, in hundreds of little ways, that you have the guts to get in the ring and wrestle with life. Mental strength is built through lots of small, daily victories.  It’s the individual choices we make day-to-day that build our “mental strength” muscles.  We all want this kind of strength, but we can’t think our way to it.  If you want it, you have to do something about it ritualistically.  It’s your positive daily rituals that prove your mental fortitude in the long run. The bottom line is that when things get difficult for most people, they find something more comfortable to do.  When things get difficult for mentally strong people, they find a way to stay on track with their positive daily rituals.  (Angel and I build positive, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.) The idea of building up enough mental strength to be OK with discomfort may sound daunting, but it’s really not.  It’s relatively easy when you take it one step at a time.  This is a discovery Angel and I made many moons ago when we were trying to dig ourselves out of a hole and get our lives back on track. We started to accept a little more discomfort by trying to live with less physical possessions and less debt, but we hated the feeling of not being able to buy things when we wanted them.  At first, it was truly uncomfortable to resist that forceful urge.  Our minds resisted, tried to run from this discomfort, and tried to make up all kinds of excuses for buying stuff we didn’t need. But we learned to be one with the discomfort, and stay the course, by spending just a little less every week.  When we did, gradually, spending less got easier and easier.  Our world didn’t end – it just got better.  We were a little uncomfortable for a while, and then we weren’t anymore. Then I watched this same process transpire with my daily workout regimen.  I didn’t want to lift weights because it was too hard.  My mind made up a bazillion excuses.  I found ways to avoid the gym.  But then I caught myself, and gradually gave in to the discomfort, a little bit at a time, and it wasn’t as hard as I imagined.  I lifted weights, and grew to love it.  Then Angel saw my progress, and she started working out too. Angel and I repeated this process for improving our diet, reducing our alcohol consumption, conquering procrastination, working through adversity, and more. Getting comfortable with discomfort – and gradually building up our mental strength in the process – has easily been the biggest key to our long-term happiness and success. If you can learn to get comfortable with discomfort, your life will be filled with fewer limits and a lot more opportunities. Here are some tips to get you started: Follow the tips above and you will gradually learn that discomfort can be a very good thing – when you’re uncomfortable, you’re trying new things, you’re learning, you’re expanding, you’re becoming more than you ever were before.  Discomfort, in most cases, is a sign that you – mind and body alike – are growing stronger… and growing closer to becoming the person you always dreamed you could be. How have you been avoiding (necessary) discomfort in your life?  What’s the next smallest step you need to take to make progress?  Leave a comment below and share your thoughts with us.  We would love to hear from YOU.

Yes, my little Mac has taught me a thing or two about the importance of being mindful and present.  In fact, he has several unique ways of calling me out whenever I’m doing the opposite.  Let me give you one simple, yet profound, example: If Mac and I are playing in his bedroom and I walk out of the room for a few moments to do something, Mac will look around and shout, “Daddy, where are you?” Seems like a logical response, right?  But here’s the kicker… If I never leave the room while we’re playing, but my iPhone vibrates with a random notification that distracts me for a few moments, Mac will look directly at me and shout, “Daddy, where are you?” In both cases, Mac knows I’m not present.  To him, my emotionally absent, distracted mindset is akin to me getting up and physically walking out of the room on him. When I realized this, I made a change. As you can tell, even though I’ve been studying and practicing mindfulness for the better part of a decade, I’m still very much a student of it (yes, sometimes my son is my best teacher too).  And I honestly feel blessed by each new lesson I receive.  Because, as I see it, the greatest thing about being a life-long student of mindfulness is that I learn more and more about myself with each passing day.  My growing awareness of myself in the present helps me to better understand what’s really going on in my head and heart every step of the way. If you’ve been feeling anxious a lot lately, or simply out of touch with what’s important to you, I urge you to become a student of mindfulness alongside me.  It’s time to recenter your mind. This morning, after finishing up a coaching call with a new course student who’s working diligently to be more mindful about her top priorities – her family and the impact she’s making with her non-profit startup – I’ve been reflecting on some of the key truths Angel and I live by, and subsequently pass on to our students, that have collectively recentered our minds and improved our mindful awareness over the years.  I’ve distilled these truths into twelve easy-to-digest quotations for you, in hopes that you may find value in them today… Mindfulness as a daily ritual is the ultimate challenge and practice.  It’s a way of living, of being, of seeing, of tapping into the full power of your humanity. Ready to get started? Use the mindfulness quotes above to recenter yourself. And then practice… Ritualize this kind of mindfulness into your daily routines, and you will undoubtedly change the way you spend the rest of your life.  (Angel and I build mindful, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.) Please share this post with others who you think will benefit from it, and also share your thoughts with us in the comments section below.  If you’re up to it, I’d love it if you shared an additional quote, reminder, or strategy that helps you to be more mindful and present, especially when life gets hectic.

"4 Ways to Keep Your Attitude Up When Life Brings You Down|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/4-keep-your-attitude-up.jpg?resize=500%2C356&ssl=1| 4 Questions that Will Turn Your Day Around|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/4-turn-your-day-around.jpg?resize=500%2C328&ssl=1| Last night I met a tired and weary soul at a local charity event.  We struck up a conversation after I helped her pick up some papers she had accidentally dropped on the floor.  She said she was volunteering at the event, and several other charity events over the next few weeks, because she didn’t really have anywhere else to be for the holidays.  Details aside, she basically told me she struggles with a lack of healthy relationships, a lack of self-confidence, and a lack of purpose in her life. I consoled her as best I could during our 10-minute conversation, and assured her that the volunteer work she’s doing is making a difference.  Then we hugged and I handed her my business card before departing.  Hopefully she reaches out to me, because there’s so much more I’d like to share with her.  I know what it’s like to feel tired and weary, to feel down and depressed, to have no one to talk to.  I have desperately struggled with anxiety and self-confidence issues numerous times in the past. So I’m writing this short post for her, and all my fellow souls out there who are tired and weary and struggling to find happiness today. You are struggling, maybe even heartbroken, and this state of being is hard to deal with.  It can feel lonely, draining, and even downright hopeless sometimes. How do you motivate yourself when you feel defeated?  How do you heal when you have little hope?  How do you connect with others when you don’t feel the self-confidence needed to put yourself out there? I know you want answers.  And I’m so sorry you’re struggling and hurting inside.  But please know that you are not alone.  It might feel like you are, but you’re not.  I, for one, am with you because I’m thinking of you right this very moment.  I’m with you because I too have agonized and ached in very similar ways.  We have shared feelings of exhaustion, uncertainty, anxiety, heartbreak, loneliness, and hopelessness. Yes, I am deeply connected to you, and my heart is filled with compassion for you. And it’s not just me who understands what you’re going through either – every living, breathing human being on this planet has felt similar feelings at some point.  We are all going through life’s struggles together – we are connected through our shared adversity.  We may feel alone on the inside, but in our inner loneliness, again, we are connected. Truth be told, the feeling of being broken and alone, cut off from the rest of society, is a delusion.  Sure, it’s a delusion that feels real.  But it’s not, I assure you. While I can’t dissolve all your pain in an instant, I can offer you a few perspective-shifting questions and annotations that have helped me get through some of the toughest days of my life.  Angel and I have also subsequently used these questions and annotations in different coaching exercises to assist our course students with mentally overcoming various forms of suffering. In general, letting go of your expectations is almost always a good idea.  If you have few expectations etched in stone, you will rarely be devastated by disappointment.  Of course, it may be tremendously hard to let go of certain expectations.  Because you still expect your personal values to be respected, you don’t expect to get a debilitating illness, and you may even expect that most people mean well.  Still, the more expectations you can let go of today, the better. But what happens when one of your expectations is tied to an unchangeable past event?  What happens when you still subconsciously expect an outcome that never came to be, and the time and place for it to transpire has passed?  You’re hopelessly stuck, that’s what! It’s time to let it GO! Letting go isn’t about having the ability to forget the past – it’s about having the wisdom and strength to embrace the present. You can’t use past experience to change past outcomes, but you can use past experience to change present outcomes.  Right now you have a priceless opportunity … to practice acceptance, to let go of old expectations, and to make the best and most positive use of this moment. Knowing when to expect and hope for outcomes – and when to let go and shift with the times – is the central challenge for spending your limited resources sensibly.  The solution to this challenge is wisdom, and wisdom doesn’t just fall from the sky.  To attain wisdom, you need life experience, including negative experiences such as heartbreak, failure, illness, loneliness and loss.  These aren’t the kind of life experiences you actively seek out, of course.  But when they find you unexpectedly, you might as well learn from them, and use them to your advantage. Unless you’re deeply depressed, sadness is just a feeling.  And as with all feelings, you choose it.  Yes, you actually make a (conscious or subconscious) choice to feel the way you do.  If you wanted to be positive and smile right now, it would be on purpose.  And if you wanted to frown, well, you could choose to do that too. A smile is indeed a choice, not a miracle.  And smiling is a choice that actually makes you feel better.  The simple act of smiling sends a message to your brain that you’re happy, and then your body pumps out all kinds of feel-good endorphins.  This reaction has been studied by dozens of positive psychologists and has been widely discussed in their field. But, of course, even if you choose to be positive and smile often, sadness is still a part of life.  Although it’s a chosen response, it’s a natural response to an adverse life experience.  And it’s generally not a bad feeling to have in the short-term, as long as you don’t allow it to consume you.  The key is to keep things in perspective, and then shift your perspective when you must. When life doesn’t work out the way you want it to, it can feel like you have nothing at all.  But that’s not true.  The desires of our ego are often in conflict with the realities of life.  Find your balance between planning and presence – between expecting and accepting.  Work for what you want, but don’t go looking for something better every second.  You must be willing to loosen your grip on the life you have planned so you can embrace the life that is waiting for you in this moment.  It may not be everything you desire, but it’s everything you need right now.  Experience it and find the positive. A recent scientific study discussed in The Happiness Advantage showed that doctors who are put in a positive mood before making a diagnosis consistently experience significant boosts to their intellectual abilities when compared to doctors in a neutral state.  This allows them to make accurate diagnoses almost 20% faster.  The same study then shifted to other vocations and found that positive-minded salespeople outsell their pessimistic counterparts by over 50%.  Students primed to feel positive and joyful before taking exams substantially outperform their neutral peers.  So it turns out that our minds are literally hardwired to perform at their best not when they are negative, or even neutral, but when they are positive. Give yourself this gift today.  Put yourself in a more positive mood, so you can put your best foot forward.  (Angel and I build actionable, mood-shifting daily rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.) Even when you’re being positive, you still have challenges to deal with – there’s no escaping this reality.  But how you feel about your life has little to do with the challenges in it or what has (or hasn’t) happened to you.  The meaning you assign to these challenges controls the quality of your life.  And you may be totally unaware just how often your subconscious mind is assigning negative meaning to every little inconvenience.  So check-in with yourself… When we shift the meaning we assign to our challenges, there’s no limit on what life can become.  A change of focus and a shift in meaning can literally alter our biochemistry and the trajectory of our lives in a couple seconds flat. So take a deep breath and remember: Meaning equals emotion, and emotion equals power.  Choose wisely.  Learn to reframe your challenges.  Find a positive, empowering meaning in every event, and the best path forward will always be yours to travel.  (Angel and I dive deeper into reframing at our annual conference, Think Better, Live Better. The next one is taking place February 18-19, 2017.  Get a discounted early bird ticket here, while they last.  Note: you can watch short clips from our 2016 event here and here.) This question cuts right to the heart of your insecurities.  Let it remind you that problems, flaws, and challenges are a part of everyone’s life.  Don’t be ashamed.  Don’t worry about being judged or rejected. What other people think of you doesn’t define you.  Set yourself free from their judgment.  What they see in you is their opinion and a reflection of what they see in the world.  Some people might perceive you as smart, funny and talented, while others might think you’re average at best, or even undesirable.  To some, you might look beautiful, and to others you might look too fat or skinny.  No matter what other people’s thoughts about you are, it’s about their standards of beauty or intelligence or awareness, and it really has very little to do with YOU. Yet, all too often we let the rejections we experience dictate every move we make.  We literally do not know ourselves to be any better than what some opinionated, uninformed person told us was true.  The truth is, a rejection doesn’t mean we aren’t good enough – it just means that some person, under some circumstance, failed to align with what we have to offer. Rejections do NOT matter. Let them go and refocus your attention on what DOES matter. What does matter is how you see yourself. Always make a habit of staying 100% true to your values and convictions, regardless of what others think.  Never be ashamed of doing what feels right. To help you implement this positive habit, start by listing out 5-10 things that are important to you when it comes to building your character and living your life.  For example: Having a short list like this to reference will give you an opportunity to consciously invoke and uphold your handpicked traits and behaviors in place of doing something random simply for the purpose of external validation.  While it may sound overly simplistic, most people never take the time to actually decide what is important to them when it comes to their self-image – they let others decide for them, especially when times are tough.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) All details aside, the greatest key to turning your day around when you’re in a funk is to focus on TODAY ONLY – just the immediate steps you need to take.  Because no matter what’s happening, anyone can resourcefully fight the battles of just one day.  It’s only when you add the battles of those two abysmal eternities, the past and future, that life gets overwhelmingly out of hand. So remember that it’s not the experience of today that holds you back, but the regret and resentment about something that happened yesterday or the fear and dread of what tomorrow might bring.  It’s necessary, then, to live just one day at a time – just today. Be here now. And just do the best you can. We would love to hear from YOU. So let’s revisit the second question I presented above: Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

It’s super simple, but absolutely vital. Recently, Marc and I had a conversation with our friend Thanh about the importance of establishing healthy, positive, supportive relationships.  This is a topic that fascinates us, and it’s something we know a lot about. As I’ve mentioned in previous posts and emails, Marc and I met Thanh at a business conference in Las Vegas some years back.  We hit it off as friends almost immediately – there was lots of synergy between our interests in personal development and in expanding our entrepreneurial business ventures. But the kicker is the immense (and immediate) positive impact Thanh’s friendship has had on both our personal and professional growth. The undeniable truth became crystal clear to us rather quickly: Who you associate with makes all the difference in your life. In many ways we, as human beings, are like Koi fish.  The Koi fish grows in proportion to its environment.  If you keep it in a small bucket of water, it grows to only a few of inches in length.  But if you let it loose in the wild it can grow up to two feet long. So are you like the Koi fish that has been kept in a small bucket?  Is your environment and social network stifling your personal and professional growth? If so, how do you make changes and build healthier relationships? During our conversation with Thanh, all three us agreed that it’s not hard to build and nurture healthy relationships as long as you are willing to uphold three essential rituals for doing so: Ironically, the prerequisite to building healthy relationships is being comfortable when you’re all by yourself. Appreciating solitude starts with the conscious awareness of the freedom it brings.  When you enjoy your own company you don’t need others around for the mere sake of having others around.  You can be flexible about who you choose to spend time with, instead of letting your fear of being alone suck you into social situations and relationships that aren’t right for you. With that said, however, journeying through life on your own two feet is a learning process – you become stronger as you go.  It’s like a kid who can’t find her way home when she’s alone – doing it the first few times is daunting and scary, but in the long run she’s safer and better off having learned the way. So just remember, it’s always better to learn to stand on your own two feet and walk alone when you must, rather than have someone carry you around your whole life.  And once you are reasonably self-sufficient, then relying on someone else from time to time is an act of inner strength, not weakness. Be friendly and introduce yourself to someone new when the opportunity arises.  Come from a place of generosity.  Focus on how you can help them.  Do you have information that could benefit them?  Do you have a skill that could assist them through their current situation?  Do you know someone who they should meet? One of the best investments you can make in yourself is to take a genuine interest in other people.  The more you help others, the more they will want to help you.  Love and kindness begets love and kindness.  And so on and so forth. Ultimately, the happiest and most successful people are always looking for ways to help others, while the unhappiest and most unsuccessful people are still asking, “What’s in it for me?” The best places to plant new seeds of friendship are at organized events covering particular topics that interest you.  For example, a good event might be a community focus group, a professional association meeting, a fitness class, a weekly group meditation hour, or any other gathering of people who share common values and goals. And since you’re on a personal development blog right now reading this article, attending a life-enhancing personal development conference, like Think Better, Live Better, would also be a great social setting to make some new connections. The bottom line is that finding the right group of people that share your values and goals may require some time and effort, but it’s worth it.  Finding a community of like-minded souls is the most effective component in building positive, lasting relationships. If the aforementioned points make sense to you, but you’re still struggling with what seems to be unhealthy, unsupportive relationships in your life, then I have a suggestion for you: Make a list of the five people you spend the most time with and your top three personal/professional values and goals.  Then compare the lists. Are the people you spend the most time with congruent with your values and goals? Are YOU and your daily rituals congruent with your values and goals? If not, it’s time to make some positive changes – it’s time to get comfortable (and proficient) standing on your own two feet, reaching out to others with a helping hand, and meeting some brand new, like-minded people that can bring positive energy into your life. A few years ago, Marc and I actually moved from San Diego to Austin to live near Thanh and other inspiring, like-minded entrepreneurs in the personal development niche because we knew we needed to be surrounded by the right people and energy while we were making some significant lifestyle and business changes.  And let me assure you, we experienced incredible, productive breakthroughs of it! The bottom line is that you need to get your mindset and rituals in order, and spend more time in a positive environment with positive people. To help you make these positive changes, Marc and I have decided to team up with Thanh and 15 other world-class personal development experts to bring you… Think Better, Live Better 2017 – A two-day live training event that I guarantee will be the right place and time to meet the right people, and set into motion a set of positive rituals and relationships that will change your life.  (Note: you can watch short clips from our 2016 event here and here.)

The reason for our suffering, in all walks of life, is our resistance to life’s inevitable changes. And life is all changes.  To have lived is to have changed often. Sometimes this is hard to accept… What you have today may become what you had by tomorrow.  You never know.  Things change, often spontaneously.  People and circumstances come and go.  Life doesn’t stop for anybody.  It moves rapidly and rushes from calm to chaos in a matter of seconds, and happens like this to people every day.  It’s likely happening to someone nearby right now. Sometimes the shortest split second in time changes the direction of our lives.  A seemingly innocuous decision rattles our whole world like a meteorite striking Earth.  Entire lives have been swiveled and flipped upside down, for better or worse, on the strength of an unpredictable event.  And these events are always happening. However good or bad a situation is now, it will change.  That’s the one thing you can count on. And while I resist change, and suffer sometimes just like everyone else, I have learned to adapt.  I have learned to be flexible and look for the beauty in life’s changes, even when they aren’t what I want.  But before we get into how to do that, let’s take a look at… Obviously, that’s just the tip of the iceberg.  Change is the only constant thing in life.  Every fraction of a second is different, and we resist it.  Our day gradually passes, our body gradually ages, our relationships gradually shift, other people don’t act the way they used to, we ourselves begin to think differently, and this is tough to deal with. So this is the pain of life’s changes, of realizing that we are not in control, of reality evolving and not meeting our expectations. The key is to cope with change in healthy ways, rather than hopeless ways… We can cope with change hopelessly in many ways (and sadly many of us do): Or we can find healthy ways to cope: But the most important thing to understand is that all healthy coping strategies require us to embrace life’s changes, first and foremost. Think about it.  If changes are a basic fact of life, then why resist?  Why not embrace, let go and live fully? Why not see the beauty in life’s changes? I know it’s hard – but only because we’re so darn used to resisting. Let’s put aside our habitual resistance and judgmental impulses for a bit, and instead look for… With a life coaching career that spans a decade, Angel and I have worked with people of all ages, in all walks of life, from every corner of the globe, and I can honestly say that nothing is more beautiful and powerful than a smile that has struggled through the tears.  So don’t regret your time, even the moments that were filled with painful life changes.  Smile because you learned from these twists and turns and gained the strength to rise above them and adapt. Ultimately, it’s not what you have been through that defines who you are; it’s how you got through it that has made you the person you are today, and the person you are capable of being tomorrow.  (Angel and I discuss this  in detail in the “Adversity” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.)

"10 Quotes for Turning an Ending into a New Beginning|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-quotes-new-beginning.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1|Click or tap on a book to check it out:     Sometimes it’s excruciatingly hard to get back up again.  This is how Marc and I felt just over a decade ago when we were knocked down and stuck in a rut after simultaneously losing two loved ones to suicide and illness.  It was nearly impossible to move when we didn’t feel we had the strength to push forward. But, we found a way. We pushed ourselves as hard as we could to take one tiny step every day—one journal entry, one 10-minute workout, one honest conversation, and so forth.  It wasn’t easy, but the tiny steps were manageable and we gradually grew stronger.  And believe it or not, that’s basically what I did again this morning.  I was desperately struggling to motivate myself for the past few days after a significant business opportunity fell through.  I was feeling utterly defeated.  So, I took the tiniest possible step.  Just turning on my laptop, opening up the word processing application, and writing a single sentence.  Such an action is so small as to seem insignificant, and yet so easy as to be possible when I was feeling desperate and defeated again this morning.  And it showed me that the next step was possible, and the next.  And the end result is the couple paragraphs you’ve just finished reading. Why am I telling you this? Because I know we all need a healthy reminder sometimes… to do the hard things we need to do to be happy.  The things that frighten us.  The things others can’t do for us.  The things that make the difference between existing and living—between knowing the path and walking the path—between a life of empty promises and defeat and one filled with renewed happiness, possibility and peace. And, along these lines, I have some great news: Marc and I wrote three bestselling books (one of them is a New York Times bestseller) to guide us—all of us—through that necessary journey of doing the hard things.  I sincerely wish I could have read these books over a decade ago.  In many ways, it would have saved me from myself.  It absolutely would have saved me from intense periods of darkness that were born primarily from my subconscious attempt to take the easy way out of the painful realities I faced. Watch what happened when Marc and I stepped into the Today Show studio recently to discuss the painful personal journey that inspired us to write…  The books are available to order together right now.  If you decide to order today, send me an email at [email protected] with your receipt information (just copy and paste or screenshot the finalized order details from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Audible, or wherever you choose to order the book.).  We’ve prepared a great digital bonus for you: a 30-point “daily reminders” book (I guarantee you’ll find immense value in this bonus). Also, watch the official Getting Back to Happy book trailer:  And yes, the new book shares the title of our renowned Getting Back to Happy course, but understandably, the book and the course are completely different educational tools. For example, our course is video based, includes live one-on-one Skype/FaceTime coaching with Marc and me, and has an active online support community. The Getting Back to Happy book is a smaller, self-paced resource you can hold in your hands and take with you wherever you go… something you can turn to in real time, offline, as you need it. Both tools—the course and the book—complement each other very well, but they are standalone. In the book, you will face the truth right from the get-go… You are not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or a week ago.  You are always growing.  Experiences don’t stop.  That’s life.  And the very experiences that seem so tough when you are going through them are the ones you will look back on with gratitude for how far you have come.  Of course, it takes practice to get there, emotionally and physically, and that’s why we wrote this for YOU. The goal of the book is not to get rid of all your negative thoughts, feelings and life situations.  That is impossible.  The goal is to change your response to them. Again, Getting Back to Happy is the book I wish Marc and I had when life’s biggest challenges came our way.  Filled with actionable steps for bouncing back from tough times and getting back on the road to happiness and success, this is a book to spark sustainable action—and to return to whenever needed.  Sharing never-before-published stories and strategies, the book shows how to harness the power of daily rituals, mindfulness, self-care, and more to shift our perspective—and our actions—in order to become our happiest and most effective selves. Order Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs today (and don’t forget to email me your receipt details, so we can send you the bonus books once they’re ready). And of course, if there’s anything else Marc and I can do to assist you, please don’t hesitate to email me ([email protected]).

Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside, awakens.”– Carl Jung Mindfulness as a daily ritual is the ultimate challenge and practice.  It’s a way of living, of being, of seeing, of tapping into the full power of your humanity. At its core, mindfulness is… Knowing this is important.  Living every day in such a way that makes mindfulness possible is life-changing.  Here are twelve basic laws of (practical) mindfulness we often cover with our coaching/course students that make mindful living a gradual reality:  As I am wrapping up this post, I am reminded that the greatest enemy of good thinking, and thus mindfulness, is busyness. Busyness isn’t a virtue, nor is it something to respect.  We all have seasons of wild schedules, but very few of us have a legitimate need to be busy ALL the time.  We simply don’t know how to live within our means, prioritize properly, and say no when we should. Although being busy can make us feel more alive than anything else for a moment, the sensation is not sustainable long term.  We will inevitably, whether tomorrow or on our deathbed, come to wish that we spent less time in the buzz of busyness and more time actually living a purposeful, mindful life.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Adversity” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.)

Photo by: Kim Carrier 7 Little Ways to Make Life Simpler|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-simpler-life.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| YOU, as much as anyone in the entire universe, deserve your love and respect. Life is hard sometimes.  It’s impossible to live well without encountering struggle, and there are some seasons in our lives that are especially heartwrenching. For Angel and me, one such season occurred over the course of 15 months when we were in our late-20’s.  It was a period of profound loss, beginning when we lost our jobs and our livelihood in the downturn of the economy.  It was a scary and financially uncertain time for our family.  “Unhappiness” is the simplest word to describe how we felt. As we were learning to navigate our new reality, we were hit with a devastating loss: the death of a mutual best friend from sudden cardiac arrest.  The loss of such a key figure in our lives was intense!  And just as we were beginning to get back on our feet, Angel’s brother passed away unexpectedly as well. With so much loss in quick succession, there were days when getting out of bed was our biggest accomplishment.  This is the nature of struggle, but as the days turn into weeks, months, and years, we learn to press forward.  We learn that we are resilient.  And we hold a greater appreciation for what we have and the people who are dear to us. Sitting here now, years later, I can honestly say that Angel and I have learned great lessons from that agonizing time in our lives.  We’ve learned how to cope with the hard times, the pain and disappointment, and above all, we’ve learned the vital importance of self-love and self-care ? the magic that makes smiling again (and again) possible. The truth is, everyone experiences unhappy circumstances on occasion, but there’s a big difference between experiencing bouts of unhappiness and living a habitually unhappy life.  That’s what chronically unhappy people do.  And although there are some exceptions (clinical depression, etc.), a vast majority of these people’s unhappiness stems from their own self-neglect. Over the past decade, Angel and I have helped thousands of unhappy people rediscover their smiles, and in the process we’ve learned a lot about the negative behaviors that typically hold them back.  Self-neglect always stands at the very top of this list.  Even if you are generally a happy person, neglecting yourself is a habit that can easily creep up on you. The key is to give yourself the extra attention you need and deserve. Resisting and ignoring your own feelings and emotions does not serve you.  It leads to stress, illness, confusion, broken relationships, fits of anger and bouts of deep, dark depression.  Anyone who has experienced any of the above knows that these states of mind are horrifically unhealthy… and when you’re in the habit of self-neglect, your standards for living nosedive, and it’s near impossible to escape. So, right now, ask yourself: “Do I love myself enough to never lower my standards for the wrong reasons?” Find the strength to say “YES!” It’s about living honorably.  It’s about doing the right thing, for YOU, no matter what, even when nobody else is going to know or understand.  At the end of the day, your reputation is what other people know about you.  Your honor is what you know about yourself. You have to admit, to a certain extent, you have spent too much of your life trying to shrink yourself.  Trying to become smaller.  Quieter.  Less sensitive.  Less opinionated.  Less needy.  Less YOU.  Because you felt broken, and you didn’t want to be too much or push people away.  You wanted to fit in.  You wanted people to like you.  You wanted to make a good impression.  You wanted to be wanted.  So you could feel healed. And so for years, you sacrificed yourself for the sake of making other people happy.  And for years, you suffered. But you’re tired of suffering, and you’re done shrinking.  Right?  Good! It’s not your job to change who you are in order to become someone else’s idea of a worthwhile human being.  You are worthwhile.  Not because other people think you are, but because you are breathing your own air, and therefore you matter.  Your thoughts matter.  Your feelings matter.  Your voice matters.  And with or without anyone’s approval or permission, you must be who you are and live your truth.  Even if it makes people turn their heads.  Even if it makes them uncomfortable.  Even if they choose to leave. You may have been broken down by adversity, but YOU are not broken.  So don’t let others convince you otherwise. Heal yourself by refusing to shrink. Choose to take up a lot of space in your own life.  Choose to give yourself permission to meet your own needs.  Choose to honor your feelings and emotions.  Choose to make self-love and self-care top priorities… Choose yourself! (Angel and I discuss all of this in more detail in the “Self-Love” and “Adversity” chapters of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) True strength is in the heart and soul, not in muscles.  It’s about having faith and trust in who you are, and a willingness to act upon it, regardless of the adversities and judgments you’ve faced.  Decide this minute to never again beg anyone for the love, respect and attention that you should be showing yourself. Today, look at yourself in the mirror and say, “I love you, and from now on I’m going to prove it!”  When you practice self-love and self-care, you give yourself the opportunity to be happy.  And when you are happy, you become a better friend, a better lover, a better family member, and a better YOU. How will you choose yourself today?  Leave a comment below and share your thoughts with the community.

Other people make lavish, life-long plans based on what they have been told “should” make them happy: “I’m going to marry the perfect man/woman, we’re going to buy our dream house and a couple cars, and we’re going to raise our children in the suburbs.”  But then they wake up ten years into their plan feeling unfulfilled and depressed. Can you relate at all?  I certainly can.  Many of us suffer in similar ways. As long as we’re busy doing whatever it is that distracts us from the truth – the whole truth about our happiness and ourselves – we go through life like stones tumbling aimlessly down a mountainside.  We bounce and react impulsively to the surrounding environment, and we blunder onward with no clear idea as to where we’re headed or why. We awake every morning wishing we could sleep in.  Then we begin each day’s work with the foremost intention to stop working as soon as feasibly possible.  Our minds grow numb to the monotony of a comfortable yet draining routine.  And somewhere along the line, as each day fades into the next, we get our house (sometimes a really big one) and cars (sometimes really fancy ones), and we start a family under pressure… and we never stop to question it all until we feel empty inside, often a decade or two later… as our smiles continue to betray the sadness that we refuse to speak of, and perhaps don’t even fully know we carry. This is how many of us live our lives – in a state of denial.  We deny the truth about how unhappy we are.  We deny the truth about how distracted we are.  We deny the truth about how little time and effort we put into the things that matter most to us.  And so it goes. But the good news is, we can change.  All of us can. Right here, right now, we can start by admitting that… At the very least, I hope this short post reminds you to pause and ask yourself… “Am I making meaningful use of this scarce and precious day?” That’s a simple question Angel and I challenge our course students and live seminar attendees to ask themselves anytime they feel unhappiness washing over them. Unhappiness is very often a sign that we’re too busy doing the wrong things.  And make no mistake about it, this kind of busyness is a widespread, modern-day sickness! We fill our calendars and our social media feeds with all kinds of busyness, oftentimes just to avoid being still… to avoid being exactly who we are, exactly where we are.  The instant we feel a bit idle, we run off in the direction of the nearest shiny object that catches our attention.  And in the process, we not only miss out on the serenity and beauty that exists within ourselves, but we also miss out on experiencing that same serenity and beauty in the environment around us.  Our busyness has blinded us with “hurry” and “worry,” and the endless need to be somewhere else, doing something else, as fast as possible. And that’s the real tragedy of it: we confuse being busy with being effective.  We feel a day late and a buck short across the board, because our daily efforts are completely misaligned with our priorities. So unhappiness festers. But it doesn’t have to.  Not any more. Right now, we can slow down and face the truth. Together. Which of the points mentioned above do you sometimes struggle with?  How have you coped?  What other truths have you learned and accepted that have helped you find happiness? Leave a reply below and share your thoughts and insights.

Then think of all the times you’ve said something negative about yourself. Which group of memories is easier to recollect? If you’re like most of us, sadly, your answer is the latter. As human beings our negative self-talk often runs rampant.  We tend to ruminate, thinking the same oppressive thoughts over and over again.  And the more we think these thoughts, the stronger they grow. A frequently visited thought is like the path our sled leaves behind on it’s way down a snowy hillside.  The more we sled down that same path, the easier it is to go down that path again, rather than starting a new one.  But, with intent and effort, we can create new paths that are just as easy to travel. When it comes to our inner dialog, replacing well-worn paths of negative thinking with fresh paths of positive thinking can be astoundingly powerful.  Various positive psychology studies have shown that people who put forth the necessary effort to do this have healthier minds and happier lives in the long run. It’s important to note, too, that replacing our negativity with positivity isn’t about turning off all our negative thoughts – that’s nearly impossible to do because negative thoughts typically arise spontaneously and uncontrollably.  It’s also not about turning our false negative thoughts into false positive ones.  The goal is to reframe negative thoughts effectively, so they are based entirely in reality, detached from needless drama, and focused on the next small, positive step forward that can be taken in the present moment. Here are two exercises Angel and I often cover in detail with our course students (and live event attendees) who are struggling with the backlash of negative self-talk: To change your thinking, you first need to have a clear understanding of what you’re thinking.  When a troubling (negative) thought arises in your mind, instead of ignoring it, pay closer attention and then record it.  For example, if you’re sitting at your desk and you catch yourself ruminating about something negative, pause and write it down immediately.  Get that raw thought out of your head and down on paper – just a short sentence or two that honestly depicts the specific thought that’s presently troubling you: “I’m not good enough for the job I’m applying for because I don’t have enough experience.” Then quickly identify what triggered the thought.  Again, be brief and specific: “I’m new to the industry, and therefore I’m feeling out of my comfort zone.” At the very least, the process of recording your troubling thoughts helps bring a healthy, objective awareness to the negativity that exists within them, which ultimately helps you shift your mindset. Many of the things you tell yourself when you ruminate about your troubles are completely and utterly false.  You really have to catch yourself in the act and bring yourself back to reality. How? The key is to challenge your negative thoughts.  And one of the simplest ways of doing this is turning them into questions.  So, let’s revisit the example mentioned in #1 – “I’m not good enough for the job I’m applying for because I don’t have enough experience.”  Simply change this thought into a question: “I’m not good enough for the job I’m applying for because I don’t have enough experience???” Then, once you’ve mulled over the question for a moment, ask yourself: Can I be absolutely certain that the answer is yes? Think about it, and then find evidence to the contrary.  What successes have you had in your career that may be applicable to this new job?  Where and when have your relevant efforts made a positive impact? Write down a short, specific list of some times when you absolutely have been good enough, and then examine it. Do you fall short sometimes?  Sure you do – everyone does.  But you also succeed in incredible ways sometimes too.  That’s the whole truth, and it’s worth reflecting on. The ultimate goal is to see yourself, and the entirety of your reality, more accurately.  (Angel and I dive deeper into this process at our annual conference.  Check out Think Better, Live Better 2017.) When you practice the exercises covered above, you will notice your negative self-talk dissipate as you gradually pave a deeper path for positive thinking. Of course, you won’t be able to completely revamp your thinking over night.  You’ve spent years navigating the negative thinking paths your mind habitually uses.  But you can create a habit of positive thinking in a relatively short time frame.  It just takes daily practice. Keep recording, reviewing, and challenging your negative self-talk whenever you’re able. It can also be advantageous to have a few go-to mantras that you can repeat silently to yourself when you need a quick mindset shift.  Here are five such mantras I personally use… Refuse to accept any more nonsense.  Refuse to settle for the same old (unchallenged) excuses, negative thoughts, and destructive self-talk. Begin anew today! There’s a quote I’ve always appreciated that’s often credited to Ignatius: “Pray as if God will take care of all; act as if all is up to you.” In my mind, that’s a powerful way to live.  It’s about using your faith to fuel positive thinking and positive action, day in and day out. That is what I wish for myself.  And that is what I wish for you. Let’s challenge negativity. Let’s choose positivity. Together. (And yes, we’re here to help if you need us.) So, let’s get started with exercise #1 above… Write down a short sentence or two that honestly depicts a specific thought that’s been troubling you.  Then try to identify what may have triggered the thought. If you’re open to it, leave a comment below and share your thoughts and findings with us.

The Mind is Your Battleground (Here’s How to Master Your Mindset)|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/your-mind-battleground.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| “There’s a vivid, beautiful, priceless piece of art hanging right in front of you.  It’s sophisticated and detailed – a painstaking labor of deep devotion and love.  The colors and textures are like no other – they soar and dip, they shine bright and leap right out at you!  And yet you choose to fixate your eyes on the tiny, dark housefly that has landed on the edge this masterpiece.  Why would you choose to do such a thing?” She cracked a half smile in my direction and then shifted her gaze down to the ground. “Look,” I said, “the point here is that there’s no possible way to be 100% certain about anything in this world.  Life, like good art, is sophisticated, complex and unpredictable.  So you’re left with a choice: either appreciate it and look for the beauty in it, or focus on the worst and dwell on it.” But if you expect the worst, you’re never disappointed,” she said under her breath. “Yeah, but who really lives like that?” I replied.  “No one – that’s who!  People die slowly every day like that, without ever truly living!” That’s the gist of a Zoom conversation I had recently with a new course student, who also attended our most recent Think Better, Live Better seminar (I’m sharing this with her full permission).  She literally started the conversation by telling me that expecting negative things to happen is her way of coping with life’s challenges.  If you can relate in any way at all, it’s time to revamp your mindset. And make no misunderstanding about it, when you are feeling down in the dumps, the battle you are going through isn’t fueled by the words or actions of others, and it isn’t fueled by what did or didn’t happen in the past either.  It’s fueled entirely by your mind that gives negativity a voice. Believing in negative thoughts and acting on them is the single greatest barrier to living a good life. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the mind is your battleground.  It’s the place where the fiercest and most ruthless conflict resides.  It’s where half of the things you feared were going to happen, never actually happened.  It’s where your expectations always get the best of you.  It’s where you fall victim to your own train of thought time and time again. And if you allow these self-defeating thoughts to dwell in your mind, they will succeed in robbing you of peace, joy, productivity, meaning, and ultimately your life.  You will think yourself into endless disappointment, heartache, and even depression. Bottom line:  You are what you think!  And you can’t change anything if you can’t change your thinking. But are you ready for the silver lining? YOU CAN change the way you think. And if you can change the way you think, you can master a new way to be. In the video clip below, recorded live at our annual Think Better, Live Better seminar, we share five powerful strategies that will adjust your mindset and ultimately allow you to live a better life.  Note: If you’d like attend next year’s Think Better, Live Better seminar in Orlando, you can get info and tickets for Think Better, Live Better 2022 here. All details aside, an effective mindset is one that makes the best use of all your available resources – your time, energy, opportunities, etc. – and uses them to support growth and positive change.  It’s not about trying to do everything and be everything.  And it’s not about living a perfect life.  It’s about being present, being accepting, and making the very best of what’s in front of you. Your mindset is the keystone and bedrock for everything that happens in your life.  As you work to adjust your mindset, here’s what you can expect from striking the right balance: I hope all that sounds like something worth working on.  Because it truly is. And Marc and I are here to help, online via our course and in person via our seminar, when you need us.  🙂 What kinds of negative, self-defeating thoughts sometimes dwell in your mind?

One Reality You Must Accept Before You Can Live Your Best Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/one-reality-best-life.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| I woke up this morning to a sunrise of astonishing beauty, so I walked out the front door to experience it.  And as I stood in the yard gazing up at the pink, orange and blue sky, my heart sung and ached at the same time. Instinctively, I wanted to share this breathtaking moment with Angel and Mac, but they were still asleep, and that troubled me.  I felt a bit down and incomplete, without being able to share this special moment with them, or with anyone.  The most beautiful sunrise I’d ever seen was slipping through my fingers. I considered running into the house to grab a camera so I could at least show Angel and Mac a photo of the moment that they missed, but I caught myself and took a deep breath. I then acknowledged that there was something else I needed to do instead: I needed to let this moment be enough, without anything more – without needing the moment to be shared or photographed or uploaded online. So I gazed back up at the sky, and told myself out loud, “This moment is enough, Marc.  This moment is enough just as it is.” Truly, there was no good reason for me to feel otherwise.  And I’m glad I came to my senses. Of course, I know I’m not alone in this feeling – that the beautiful moments of our lives need to be shared, or photographed, or uploaded online to be complete.  It’s half the reason social media is so prevalent in our lives today. Too often we feel like the good moments of our lives aren’t good enough unless we somehow capture, share, and solidify them as a semi-permanent fixture in our lives. Or we feel like the moments of our lives just aren’t good enough at all.  So we choose to distract ourselves with gadgets and TV shows 24/7 just to stimulate ourselves.  It’s like second nature to us – we’re so used to feeling like the present moment isn’t worthy of our full presence! And this mindset of dissatisfaction and distraction – of reality never being enough for us – trickles into every facet of our lives… But what if we accepted this moment, and everything and everyone in it, as exactly enough? What if we accepted that this moment is slipping away right now, and saw the fleeting time we have within this moment as enough, without needing to share it or capture it or alter it in any way? Think about it… This moment is enough. What if we started acting like it? Like I mentioned above, I often forget to pause and appreciate the present moment for what it is.  So I’ve implemented a simple strategy to support the practice of doing so.  In a nutshell, I proactively remind myself… And anytime I catch myself thinking otherwise, I pause and read the following mantras to myself (I keep them on a folded paper in my wallet).  Then I take a deep breath, and bring my focus and appreciation back to the present… So let’s revisit a question I presented above: How might doing so change your life? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

"One Surprisingly Simple Choice that Will Change Your Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/one-simple-choice.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| An Open Letter to Those Who Always Put Themselves Last|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/open-letter-self-care2.jpg?resize=500%2C451&ssl=1| 20 Ways to Accidentally Ruin the Next 20 Years of Your Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/20-ruin-years-of-your-life.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities. And so often, against our better judgment, we accidentally make the wrong choices. Our pride has us holding on when we need to let go. Pressure from peers sways us left when we mean to go right. Negative thoughts provoke frowning on otherwise beautiful days. And so it goes… One choice at a time, one moment at a time, we ruin the most promising days of our lives. If you can relate at all, it’s time to answer your wake-up call. How many times have you thought “this isn’t working” or “something is not right” or “things have to change”?  Those thoughts are coming from your intuitive inner voice.  It’s your wake-up call calling. You don’t need a major life crisis to wake you up, either.  And no one needs to tell you what needs to change, because you already know.  Your inner voice has been trying to tell you, but in case it’s been a challenge to find time and space to listen through the chaos, maybe you’ll resonate with one of these situations. Getting your wake-up call is not the hard part, answering the call is.  Choosing to answer the call instead of ignoring it is the hard part.  Right now, it may feel easier to keep going, and going, and going without making a change.  But you know if you don’t find a way out of the endless cycle you’re in, it’s going to ruin you. No doubt, a big part of your life is a result of the choices you make.  And if you don’t like your life it’s time to start making changes and better choices. Based on over a decade of one-on-one coaching sessions with hundreds of students from around the world, and hearing dozens of personal stories every year from attendees at our live annual events, here are 20 ways we as human beings gradually ruin decades of our own lives, and some ideas on how to make better choices going forward: If you’ve been struggling with any of the above points… Don’t be afraid to get back up.  Don’t be afraid to love again.   Find the strength to laugh again.  Find the courage to feel different, yet beautiful.  Find it in your heart to make others smile too.  Remember that you don’t need many people in your life, just a few great ones, so don’t lower yourself to have more “friends.”  Be strong when things get tough.  Remember that the universe is always doing what’s right.  Recognize when you’re wrong and learn from it.  Don’t hold on too tightly.  Always look back and see how much you’ve grown, and be proud of your progress.  Don’t change for anyone, unless you want to.  Give more.  Give the things you love so others can love them too.  Write stories.  Take photos.  Remember the little moments and the way your loved ones look at you. Inspire yourself to make better choices going forward! Change your habits! The truth is, it’s just as easy to create positive habits as it is to create negative ones.  It’s just a matter of how you spend your time.  You can spend it doing things that bring you closer to your goals, or you can spend it seeking immediate comfort.  For example, some people complain, “It’s too hard to exercise every day!”  But exercise and movement are joyful, natural conditions that make us feel incredible.  It’s not hard – it’s just that people get in the habit of not exercising.  If this sounds like you, break the habit.  Realize that you are where you are because of the choices you’ve made in the past, and your future depends on the choices you make today.  You can choose to sit, or you can choose to run.  You can choose to watch another sitcom, or you can choose to read another chapter in a great book.  You can choose to act on an opportunity, or you can choose to sleep in.  There’s nothing hard or complicated about it, other than the way you’re thinking about it. Think better, live better!  🙂 If you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU. Which point mentioned above resonates with you the most today, and why?

Forgetting These 7 Little Things Makes Every Day More Stressful|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-every-day-more-stressful.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| It never ceases to amaze me when I’m faced with the reality of how easily I lose sight of the truth – I catch myself stressing out over something silly, even though I know better.  And I know I’m not alone in my forgetfulness.  So much happens in our lives – so much chaos and distraction – that we often forget the important things we learned long ago.  Busy days and demanding obligations have a tendency to put our minds on autopilot, making us more reactive and less mindful every step of the way. Therefore, some of life’s most important lessons need to be reviewed to be remembered. Keep this short list handy and give it a read any time you catch yourself in one of those inevitable, forgetful moments of stress and frustration… Have you ever felt incredibly overwhelmed? Well then, it’s time for a quick story about life… Once upon a time there was a woman who had been lost in the desert for three whole days without water.  Just as she was about to collapse, she saw what appeared to be a lake just a few hundred yards in front of her.  “Could it be?  Or is it just a mirage?” she thought to herself. With the last bit of strength she could muster, she staggered toward the lake and quickly learned that her prayers had been answered: it was no mirage – it was indeed a large, spring-fed lake full of fresh water – more fresh water than she could ever drink in her lifetime.  Yet while she was literally dying of thirst, she couldn’t bring herself to drink the water.  She simply stood by the water’s edge and stared down at it. There was a passerby riding on a camel from a nearby desert town who was watching the woman’s bizarre behavior.  He got off his camel, walked up to the thirsty woman and asked, “Why don’t you have a drink, ma’am?” She looked up at the man with an exhausted, distraught expression across her face and tears welling up in her eyes.  “I am dying of thirst,” she said, “But there is way too much water here in this lake to drink.  No matter what I do, I can’t possibly finish it all.” The passerby smiled, bent down, scooped some water up with his hands, lifted it to the woman’s mouth and said, “Ma’am, your opportunity right now, and as you move forward throughout the rest of your life, is to understand that you don’t have to drink the whole lake to quench your thirst.  You can simply take one sip.  Just one small sip… and then another if you choose.  Focus only on the mouthful in front of you, and all your anxiety, fear and overwhelm about the rest will gradually fade.” Take this story to heart.  Let it sink in… And then challenge yourself throughout the day to focus solely on the sip (task, step, etc.) you’re actually taking. Honestly, that’s all life is – small, positive actions that you take moment by moment, and then one day when you look back it all adds up to something worthwhile – something that’s often far better, and different, than what you had imagined when you started. The most common form of clutter in our lives? Busyness. And busyness is an illness. Think about your own life and the lives of those close to you.  Most of us have a tendency to do as much as we possibly can – cramming every waking minute with events, extravagances, tasks and obligations. We think doing more will get us more satisfaction, success, etc.  When oftentimes the exact opposite is true. Less can be far more rewarding in the long run.  But we’re so set in our ways that we can’t see this. And so… How can we tame our urge to do too much? Simply focus more on doing less every step of the way. Be mindful of the urge to over-do it. It’s taken me awhile to get the hang of it, but I’m getting there… I hope you will join me on this journey. Let’s do a little less… and make the less we do count for even more. Being positive and seeing the good does not mean ignoring the negative.  Being positive and seeing the good means overcoming the negative.  There is a big difference between the two. Of course, that’s easy to say.  But how do you actually change your perspective from negative to positive when life gets the best of you? Here’s a simple strategy to start with… Next time you catch a thought stressing you out, ask yourself these four questions that we’ve adapted from philosophical research by Alan Watts and Byron Katie: Just remember that behind every stressful feeling is an untrue thought.  Before the thought you weren’t suffering, but after the thought you began to suffer.  When you recognize that the thought isn’t true, once again there is no suffering.  When you change your thoughts, you gradually change your life. The four questions above are just a starting point for revisiting and reframing the troubling or confusing situations that arise in your daily life.  From there you can challenge the stories you’re subconsciously telling yourself and reality-check them with a more objective mindset, which ultimately allows you to make better decisions about everything. So challenge yourself to use this tool… to think differently. Detach yourself from the negative thoughts you’re telling yourself.  Go deeper into reality.  Don’t just look at the surface.  Investigate.  Observe without jumping to conclusions. Who knows what you’ll see when you stop looking through a lens drastically narrowed by half-truths, and you start seeing things with a clearer mind.  Maybe you’ll start seeing things you never saw before.  Maybe you’ll start experiencing things you never experienced before.  Maybe you’ll learn lots of new lessons you needed to learn.  And maybe you’ll gradually become the person you always knew you could be.  (Angel and I discuss this whole process in detail in the “Letting Go of Painful Emotions” lesson of Getting Back to Happy.) Holding on can be painful.  Holding on can directly contribute to stress, health complications, unhappiness, depressive thoughts, relationship problems, and so on. Yet, as human beings, we cling desperately to almost everything. We don’t like change, so we resist it. We want life to be the way we think it “should” be. We get attached to our fantasies…. even when they hurt us. Over the past decade, as Angel and I have gradually worked with hundreds of our course students, coaching clients, and live event attendees, we’ve come to understand that the root cause of most human stress is simply our stubborn propensity to hold on to things.  In a nutshell, we hold on tight to the hope that things will go exactly as we imagine, and then we complicate our lives to no end when our imagination doesn’t represent reality. So how can we stop holding on? By realizing that there’s nothing to hold on to in the first place. Most of the things we desperately try to hold on to, as if they’re real, solid, everlasting fixtures in our lives, aren’t really there. Or if they are there in some form, they’re changing, fluid, impermanent, or simply imagined in our minds. Life gets a lot easier to deal with when we understand this. Imagine you’re blindfolded and treading water in the center of a large swimming pool, and you’re struggling desperately to grab the edge of the pool that you think is nearby, but really it’s not – it’s far away. Trying to grab that imaginary edge is stressing you out, and tiring you out, as you splash around aimlessly trying to holding on to something that isn’t there. Now imagine you pause, take a deep breath, and realize that there’s nothing nearby to hold on to. Just water around you. You can continue to struggle with grabbing at something that doesn’t exist… or you can accept that there’s only water around you, and relax, and float. Today, I challenge you to ask yourself: Then imagine the thing you’re trying to hold on to doesn’t really exist. Envision yourself letting go… and just floating. How would that change your situation? Bottom line: We cause 99% our own problems by holding on too tightly, to everything. But we can get out of our own way, and find harmony, by letting go. Rather than focusing on what you don’t have and begrudging those who are “better off” than you, perhaps you should acknowledge that you have lots to be grateful for. Most of us have amazing family members, friends, and other loved ones who love us back.  Learn to appreciate what a gift that is.  Most of us have good health, which is another gift.  Most of us have eyes, with which to enjoy the amazing gifts of sunsets and nature and beauty all around us.  Most of us have ears, with which to enjoy music – one of the greatest gifts of them all. You may not have all these things, because you can’t have everything, but you certainly have enough.  You have plenty of good things in your life that you can focus on and build upon today.  If you’re still struggling to find something right now, start here: Be honest: when was the last time you were appreciative for simply being alive, or going to sleep with a full belly?  More specifically, think of all the little things you experience — the smell of a home-cooked meal, hearing your favorite song when it randomly comes on the radio, seeing a marvelous sunset, etc. Look around you today, and water the grass you’re standing on! You will end up extremely disappointed if you expect people will always do for you as you do for them.  Not everyone has the same heart as you. Truth be told, being emotionally strong and committed to a cause doesn’t mean you have to stay and fight all the battles and petty arguments that come your way.  It means just the opposite – you don’t have to stay and respond to other people’s rude remarks and unnecessary hostility.  When you encounter someone with a bad attitude, don’t respond by throwing insults back at them.  Keep your dignity and don’t lower yourself to their level.  True strength is being bold enough to walk away from the nonsense with your head held high. You need to remember that life is not about justifying yourself – it’s about creating yourself.  Your life is yours alone.  Others can judge you and try to persuade you to their point of view, but they can’t decide anything for you.  They can walk with you if they choose, but not in your shoes.  So make sure the path you decide to walk aligns with your own intuition and best judgment, and don’t be scared to walk alone and pave your own path when doing so feels right under your feet. Make this your lifelong motto: “I respectfully do not care.”  Say it to anyone who passes unfriendly judgment on something you strongly believe in or something that makes you who you are.  People will inevitably judge you at some point anyway, and that’s OK.  You affected their life; don’t let them affect yours.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” chapter of our brand NEW BOOK.) If there’s one thing all six of the previous points have in common, it’s the importance of responding to life’s surprises and challenges more effectively.  When you can let go of needless ideals, judgments, and self-pity parties, you give yourself the space required to respond to life’s difficult situations more effectively… and that changes everything. And this applies to everyday difficulties too, not just life’s larger scale catastrophes.  For example, when my 2-year-old son, Mac, dumped his dinner plate on the floor last night, I could have gotten upset (“He knows better and he shouldn’t do that!”) and scream (not effective at all), or I could have done exactly what I did and simply let go of that ideal – that judgment – and the resulting tension, and then calmly explain the situation to Mac while helping him clean it up (and yes he actually helped too).  My response was indeed the more effective option. Regardless of the situation at hand, when we respond in emotional haste and angst, we only compound our problems.  Taking a deep breath, or ten, and responding calmly means we’re going to be able to better handle any difficult situation, whether it’s an emergency or the unexpected loss of a loved one or a 2-year-old’s belligerent misconducts. Of course, all of this is easier said than done.  So if you’re struggling to change your response to an unexpected life situation right now, start by evaluating the tension in your body and posture.  I bet you can find some kind of tightness.  For me, it’s often in my neck, but sometimes it’s in my back and shoulders. Where does this tension we feel come from?  We’re resisting life – perhaps we’re annoyed by someone, frustrated at our circumstances, overwhelmed by all our obligations, or just flat out bored.  And our mental resistance creates a tension in our bodies and unhappiness in our lives.  Therefore, Angel and I often recommend this simple strategy to our course students who are struggling to relieve themselves of their resistance and tension: Repeat this practice as often as needed.  Face the day with less tension and more presence.  Change your mode of response from one of struggle and resistance to one of peace and acceptance.  And see how doing so changes your life. If you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU. Which point mentioned above resonates with you the most today, and why? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

Although young students like Marco suddenly had the day off from school, Valentina still needed to visit her office for a couple hours to finish up some important paperwork with a new client.  So, despite the snowstorm, Valentina drove to work, leaving Marco in their nearly snowed-in home to write a short essay that was assigned by his teacher to make up for the missed school day. Shortly after Valentina arrived at her office she received a text message from Marco that read: “Windows completely frozen.  Will not open.” Valentina squinted at her phone in confusion, because she couldn’t fathom why Marco wanted to open any of the windows.  But she was really busy and about to head into a business meeting with her client, so she didn’t have time to sort out the details.  She quickly texted Marco a simple fix she had learned as a young girl growing up in the mountains: “Warm up a cup of water in the microwave, pour it evenly over the edges, then lightly tap the edges with a mallet.” Valentina then hurried into her business meeting.  While she was working with her client she felt her phone vibrate a few times from new text messages, and when the meeting was over an hour later, she read the text messages. The first text from Marco read, “What?  Are you sure that works?” Then, “Please hurry up!  I have to turn in my essay soon!” Finally, “The laptop is dead!” Confused by the messages, Valentina called Marco.  He picked up, irritated and distraught. “First… what’s wrong with the laptop?” Valentina asked. “I don’t know,” Marco replied.  “I poured warm water over all of its edges and tapped them with a mallet, just like you told me to.  But now it won’t even turn on,” Valentina suddenly realized her 10-year-old son’s initial text message was not about the windows of their new home… rather, he had texted her about the Windows operating system that runs his laptop computer!  Marco’s laptop was simply frozen… but now, thanks to a cup of warm water and the light tapping of a mallet, it was indeed dead! REMEMBER: In life, in business, and in our relationships, the biggest mistakes can arise from the smallest misunderstandings.  We can avoid these misunderstandings with a simple approach: slow down, listen to others, and clarify what they mean.  Yes, it will take a few more moments of your time.  But it will also save you from painful headaches and heartache later on!  (Angel and I build “better communication” habits with our students in the “Love and Relationships” module of Getting Back to Happy.) Truth be told, much unhappiness has come into the world because of bewilderment and things left miscommunicated. We know this. We know misunderstandings tear us apart. We know healthier communication leads to healthier relationships. And yet we forget. We forget to make time for each other. We forget to be present. We forget to really listen. Day after day, we collectively misunderstand each other into hundreds of unnecessary headaches and heartbreaking mistakes. And, like you, I’m only human – I still miscommunicate and misunderstand people, especially when I’m in a hurry.  So I’ve implemented a simple strategy to support the practice of paying better attention to the people in my life.  In a nutshell, I proactively remind myself of the truths I already know but often forget.  Anytime I catch myself avoiding a conversation I know I need to have with someone, I pause and read the following mantras to myself (I have them stored in the Notes on my iPhone).  Then I tune in to this person with full presence… Honestly, if Angel and I had a dollar for every time we’ve heard about an unfortunate life situation directly caused by a combination of excessive busyness and poor communication, we would be able to send everyone we know an inscribed gold plaque of Valentina and Marco’s story as a wake-up call. Let it be YOUR wake-up call! Please leave a comment below to let us know: What’s one small misunderstanding that turned into a big mistake in your life, or in the life of someone you know?  How might slowing down, listening more closely, and clarifying things have changed this scenario’s outcome? Anything else to share? We would love to hear from YOU.  🙂 Also, if you haven’t done so already, be sure to sign-up for our free newsletter to receive new articles like this in your inbox each week.

"7 Things to Remember When You Feel Cheated On|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-cheated-on.jpg?resize=500%2C282&ssl=1| Sometimes we feel cheated on by others. Sometimes we feel cheated on by our circumstances. Sometimes we feel cheated on by life itself. In any case, we are faced with the reality that things aren’t always what they seem – we don’t always get what we expect.  And we begin to learn that our expectations are like fine pottery – the harder we hold on to them, the more likely they are to crack wide open. So what can we do? Embrace reality, and make the best of it. The truth is, we were promised trials and tribulations right from the beginning.  They were always part of the program.  Growing up we were told, “What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger.”  And I’ve accepted it.  The relationships, jobs, and projects that didn’t work out led me closer to the ones that did.  The things I’ve lost too soon opened my mind to understandings and opportunities I never fathomed beforehand.  So while I’ve rarely gotten exactly what I wanted, I’ve often received more than I bargained for. Of course, in the heat of the moment, when disappointing things are happening to YOU, not to others, and the outcomes you’re dealing with are REAL, not imagined, embracing reality and making the best of it is not easy. You feel cheated on. You feel victimized. You feel crushed. Which is why, first and foremost, it’s important to… Imagine you had a ripe, juicy apple sitting on a table in front of you.  You pick it up eagerly, take a nibble, and begin to taste it. You already know how an apple should taste, and so when this one is a bit more tart than you expected, you make a face, feel a sense of disappointment and swallow it, feeling cheated out of a good experience. Or perhaps the apple tastes EXACTLY as you expected – nothing special at all.  So you swallow without even pausing to enjoy its flavor, and you move on with your day. In the first scenario, the apple let you down because it didn’t meet your expectations.  In the second, it was too plain and unexciting because it met your expectations to a T. Do you see the irony here? It’s either not good, or not good enough. This is how many of us live our lives… unhappily. It’s why many of us feel cheated on, victimized, and crushed far too often. Now imagine you try this instead: eliminate your expectations of how the apple “should” taste.  You don’t know, and you don’t pretend to know, because you haven’t tried it yet.  Instead, you’re genuinely curious, impartial and open to a variety of flavors. You taste it, and you truly pay attention.  You notice the juiciness, the grainy texture of the skin, the simultaneously sweet, tangy and tart flavors swirling around your tongue, and all the other complex sensations that arise in your awareness as you chew.  You didn’t know how it would taste, but now you realize it’s different than the rest, and it’s remarkable in it’s own way.  It’s a totally new experience – a worthwhile experience – because you’ve never tasted THIS apple before. Mindfulness practitioners often refer to this as “beginner’s mind,” but really it’s just the outcome of a mindset free of needless and stressful expectations. The apple, of course, can be substituted for anything in your life: any event, any circumstance, any relationship, any person, any thought at all that enters your mind, anytime and anyplace.  If you approach any of these with expectations of “how it should be,” they will surely disappoint you in some way… or be too plain and unexciting to remember. And you’ll just move on to the next disappointment or unexciting experience, and the next, and the next, and so on and so forth, until you’ve lived your entire life stuck in an endless cycle of things you barely like or barely even notice… Until you kinda feel cheated on by everything and everyone you’ve ever known. But if you approach each event, circumstance, relationship, etc. without expectations – and just see that event, circumstance, relationship, etc. at face value – then you will truly see it.  You will truly experience it like you’ve never experienced anything before, because you haven’t.  And you will be able to mindfully respond to whatever happens next. Now that we’ve cleared the air a bit, and established some healthy breathing room, let’s get real about something else: At some point, even when you’ve done your part to be mindful of your expectations, someone you trust or respect will deliberately hurt you.  They will cheat on you in some way by placing their own self-centered agenda ahead of your feelings.  And they will do it remorselessly, without an apology. When you are faced with this reality, and you’re struggling to cope, let me prompt you with some essential reminders that Angel and I often review with our course students who are struggling with similar circumstances: In what ways have you struggled with feeling “cheated on” or disappointed by the outcomes in your life and relationships?  How have you coped?  Please leave a comment below and share your insights with us.

Photo by: Volkan Olmez 16 Quotes that Show Us Life from a Different Perspective|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/16-quotes-perspective.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| 3 Ways to Find Your Peace When Life Feels Overwhelming|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-quotes-overwhelmed.jpg?resize=500%2C290&ssl=1| Too much to do, not enough time to do it. Sound familiar? Twenty-five years ago, at the dawn of the modern internet revolution, people were predicting that our technological advancements would eventually allow us to work less, so we could pay more attention to what’s truly important in our lives.  Today, however, there’s plenty of evidence to the contrary. We may be able to achieve twice as much in half the time, but that’s what’s expected of us now – it’s the new baseline.  On top of that, technology fills our free time with endless distractions – we’re checking text messages, email, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc., 24/7. And so, despite its benefits, our technology has us feeling as desperately overwhelmed as ever. The solution? Mindfulness. Or more specifically: mindfulness as it relates to prioritizing, letting go, and reframing our thoughts. The moment we admit to ourselves that we’re trying to cram too many things (tasks, obligations, distractions, etc.) into a relatively small space (24 hours in a day), it becomes obvious that we need to clear some clutter from our schedules. Mindful prioritization is the key. Pay close attention to all the things you do today – all the things you’re trying to fit into 24 hours.  How much TV are you watching in the morning and evening?  What websites are you browsing?  What games are you playing?  How much time are you spending texting, emailing, or updating your social media accounts?  How much online window-shopping are you doing?  How much time do you allocate to eating, cleaning, and taking care of others?  What else are you spending the precious minutes of your day on? What you might notice first is that you’re doing too many random things that don’t need to be done – too many time-wasters.  Then you might also notice that you’re overcommitted with too many obligations – and those obligations are filling up your life. You can start stealing your time back by eliminating as many needless distractions and obligations as possible, and saying “no” to new ones that arise.  Easier said than done, of course, but the important thing to realize is that you CAN change how you allocate your time. Next, look at your to-do list (assuming you have one): how many of these things can you reasonably do in the next 24-hours?  Probably only three to five, with sanity. Now ask yourself this: which task would you work on if you could only work on one task over the next 24 hours?  That is your #1 priority.  Just that one task.  The truth is, you probably can’t complete everything on your list in one day’s time, and you can’t do your top three to five tasks right now.  You can do only one thing at a time.  So just focus on your #1 task and, once you’re done, then figure out what your next #1 task is. Clear everything else away, and focus. So what about all the other things you want to do (or feel you “should” do), that you simply can’t get done?  What do you do with the tasks that don’t fit into 24 hours? This is where the art of letting go comes into play. You had too many things you wanted to fit into your day, and now you realize this, so you’ve decided to only put the important things on your priority list.  But that means there’s likely a few things you think you “should” do that are not going to fit. So what can you do? You can do those things tomorrow.  Or you can decide to not do them at all.  Either way, the reality is they won’t fit into the next 24 hours of your life.  And since these things were not top priorities, there’s really no problem. A problem only arises when you feel anxiety, overwhelm, and frustration because you can’t fit everything in.  But you have to realize that the way you feel is based on your ideals – the thought that you should be able to do it all, be everything to everyone, and be super human – not your reality. So you have to adjust your ideals to match reality.  The reality is that you can’t do everything today.  You can only choose to do some things – the important things – and everything else will have to wait until tomorrow, or get removed from your list. Since you can’t get more than 24 hours out of a day, you need to adjust your ideals. Focus on what’s truly important, and do what you can do today. That is enough. Let go of thinking that it isn’t. Once you have your priorities better managed, and you’ve let go of some things, it’s time to reframe how you’re generally thinking about the busyness that overwhelms you. As human beings, how busy we think we are amplifies how overwhelmed we feel.  That is, the stories we tell ourselves about life can dramatically escalate, or ease, our stress levels.  This is where reframing makes all the difference. In a recent coaching session, one of our newest course students, Rebecca, a wife and mother to three who owns a successful photography business, recently told us about how she has reframed the way she thinks about her life (I’m sharing this with permission): “I used to describe my life as overwhelming and busy, but not anymore.  Now, I see it as exceptionally rich and interesting.  I feel empowered by the challenges I face personally and professional.  I’m not in denial and I’m definitely exhausted at the end of most days.  But it’s now a satisfying kind of exhaustion.  I did what I could do, and I did my best.  And that makes me feel good.  Of course, there are tough compromises that must be made some days, but that’s OK – the compromises I must make just shine a light back on my priorities.  I can’t do it all.  But I can do my best.  And I can do things for the right reasons.  And I can make people feel respected and loved along the way.” The bottom line is that it’s easy to feel overwhelmed when you have lots of responsibilities, commitments, and tasks on your plate.  The key is to narrow down your priorities, let go when it makes sense, and then find a “reframe” that allows you to see how your life isn’t really overwhelming but instead rich and interesting, and only as busy as YOU decide to make it. If you need a little extra inspiration, here are seven quotes that help me keep things in perspective – they include some key lessons I’ve learned over the years that I’ve documented in various archived blog posts (and now our book).  When life gets hectic, and I feel overwhelm creeping up on me, I reflect on these quotes for as long as it takes me to shift my mindset.  I encourage you to do the same… Challenge yourself today to focus solely on the one important thing you’re actually doing, one small step at a time. Honestly, that’s all life is – a ritual of taking small, important steps, moment by moment, and then one day when you look back it all adds up to something worthwhile… something that’s often far better, and different, than what you had envisioned when you started.  (Note: Angel and I build small, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.) So please leave a comment below and let us know: What’s the one small, important step you are going to focus on next?

Photo by: Dingzeyu Li One Surprisingly Simple Rule that Will Change Your Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/one-surprisingly-simple.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| You won’t see this as a news headline, but you should: SOCIETY IS SICK WITH THE DISEASE OF BUSYNESS! Being overbooked has somehow become a badge of honor. And I’m no saint. When I was 22 I scribbled this well-meaning task at the top of my to-do list: Walk into a nursing home. Ask the staff to nominate their loneliest visitor. Knock on an unsuspecting stranger’s door. Show up and listen. My intention was to deliver some light and love to a wise soul who had been tucked away in a quiet room. To assure them they had not been forgotten. But busy days weaved themselves together to form busy weeks. Those busy weeks compounded to create chaotic months. Before I knew it, I had stacked up a bunch of where-the-heck-did-they-go years. Isn’t it ironic how the most important things in our lives tend to get scheduled with the scraps of what’s left over after the rest of world takes what it wants? Fast forward five years. At 27, I decided it was time to start living the story I wanted to look back on. My calendar would now include more than conference calls, work deadlines, and other people’s needs. I walked through the front doors of a nursing home in my neighborhood on a rare, uncomfortably cold Texas winter evening. The staff scanned their roster looking for a resident who was “visitor deprived.” Their nomination sat quietly in room 202. I walked nervously through the long quiet halls. The sound of my shoes echoed off the dingy yellow tile and plain beige walls. As I passed each door, I took time to read every hand decorated name placard. I considered carefully that each represented a real person… and an entire life story stretched behind them that I knew nothing about. By the time I was standing in front of the hand painted placard that read 202, my palms were sweating through my scruffy winter mittens. I had no idea who I was about to find. But I knew there was nowhere else on the entire globe my feet needed to be planted other than right in front of this stranger’s door. Why? Because the memories you remember most are rarely born from within your comfort zone. I knocked on the door intending to deliver a gift, but discovered one instead. On the other side sat 98-year-old Ella.  When I asked Ella about the best moments of her life, her response startled me. Grabbing my hand, she squeezed it tight. Excitement washed over her as she replied through an enormous smile, “My life has been SO, SO FULL, Kendra!” Gratitude poured out of her and bathed the room the way sunshine flows over a skyline at dawn. No crevice left untouched. Warmth everywhere. I was confused and equally fascinated. This was not what I expected. How did she feel so full while being tucked away in this tiny room? While many of us struggle with feelings of emptiness, even when we’re surrounded by our big families, lavish lives, and latest iDevices? Grinning, she laid her long life story out like a homemade movie – glowing brightly about all the fascinating ways she collected an incredible amount of breathtaking, beautiful memories. She beamed about a powerful rebellious love that lasted for decades. We chuckled together when she tallied up the outlandish risks of her youth (and there were many). She honestly had the ultimate luxury that all of us are after but none of us can buy – a life well lived. Even while living in a small room with plain beige walls and having basically no visitors the past few months, nothing could take away the satisfaction a life well lived now gave her. During the hour and a half we spent together, storytelling and laughing, Ella repeatedly and passionately urged me to make time for exciting life experiences. It was the number one piece of wisdom she wanted me to know, and she even asked me to promise myself that I would. Driving home, I steered through tears. I considered how it took me 27 years to turn the doorknob of room 202. And yet, I make it to work every day… and I even make it to the dentist at least twice a year (when I’m behaving like a real adult). What else had I been doing all those years that was more important than moments like this? I don’t remember most of my early twenties. Probably because I never slowed down long enough to actually live them. I was asleep at the wheel. My life was on autopilot. Thankfully I was young, and mostly only foolish in that one specific way. Everything changed when I started taking things off of my “someday” list and began putting them on a day of the week that actually exists: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. What I’ve found, and other people living with less regret have confirmed for me, is this: If something important isn’t on the calendar, it doesn’t happen. Yes, we have to earn a paycheck, and go to the dentist, and shop for groceries, and do various forms of busywork. But not at the total expense of getting to the end of our lives and wondering where the heck it went! Collecting experiences, adventures and face time with amazing people is at least – if not more – important than most of our other tasks and obligations. So what do we do? Plan personal time off the clock with the same level of intentionality that we use for our “professional” lives. If we don’t, chance will lead us to choose comfort (doing nothing) every single time. Getting comfortable with being uncomfortable is the one hard thing we have to do to live a life we are excited and happy to look back on. Hear me now but believe me later: until your personal priorities have dates in your day planner they will tumble to the bottom of your infinitely expanding to-do list. The part of this story you almost didn’t read was how I wanted to bail on Ella that night. As great as my intentions were, they were doing a pretty pitiful job of getting me out the door when the weather was inconvenient and I was exhausted. By my own failure to set boundaries in my workload, I clocked a grueling ten hours that day. Plus, a friend who was supposed to tag along for the adventure bailed. My motivation meter was sittin’ heavy on zilch. Nada. Nothing. No gas in the tank. But this was no longer on my “maybe I’ll get to it list” that evening like it had been for several years. It was on my calendar. I had committed. I had finally learned to carve out time in my day so it would be about more than earning a paycheck… and running around. And laying down my badge of busyness so I can live a life I will be proud to look back on, I realized, can start small. One day at a time. So I walked down the halls of that nursing home a year and a half ago. And do you want to know what I remember most about the evening I knocked on door 202? If you said that it wasn’t the deadlines I miraculously hit or how I felt when I didn’t want to leave my warm house and venture into the cold, you’re smart and I like you. What I do remember is slowing down long enough to create a memory worth remembering for the rest of my life: Ella. I remember who I had to become to face the task of walking up to her door all by myself. I remember sweating through my mittens, not knowing what or who I would find on the other side. I remember crisscrossing my balmy fingers and cold toes hoping someone would be grateful I was there (instead of wondering if I was a wacko). And I’ll never forget the way Ella hugged me goodbye. Long and hard. Like a friend she loved dearly and wasn’t sure when she would see again. Although my task list had been impressively long that day, I completed the most important item: slow down to create a moment that I would remember. And life has never been the same since.  I’ve certainly remembered a lot more from my late twenties than my early twenties. Simply because I started making appointments to actually show up and live. If we are more than our work and the demands of the world (and we are), why doesn’t more than that get scheduled on our calendar? Imagine a list of 100 things you want to do or experience — little and large. How many of your goals, dreams and desires actually have dates on your day planner? If we aren’t actively working toward slashing items off that list then why the heck are we working so darn hard anyway? Now I live by one simple rule: schedule something exciting on the calendar every week – preferably something fresh and different that allows me to share a smile with others. Because most memories worth remembering don’t happen by accident. We know our ideas to pay it forward will make us feel good. We know planning an unforgettable date night with our partner vs. just dusting off the Netflix queue will make us feel alive. We know putting our phones down to be present and enjoy a playful pillow fight with our little ones will make us smile. So why don’t we do those things? Simple. We are too busy… trying to be “successful” or whatever. I promise, you are more than your job. You are more than your errands, and meetings, and your mortgage. You are more than other people’s priorities for you. You are more than 24/7 busyness. So make room on your calendar for more than just the things that keep you busy. Take one thing off your “someday list” of personal priorities and put it on your calendar this week. It doesn’t have to be large to make an impact. Small is the perfect place to start when you’re ready to start showing your calendar who is boss. Block off time to make it home from work at a reasonable hour, and surprise your significant other with a slow dance and twirl in the living room. Build a blanket fort with your kids. Flick off all the lights and navigate the house with only flashlights and curiosity. If you’re single, ask a friend you trust to set you up on a blind date with the most creative, interesting, lighthearted single person they know. Walk into a nursing home and help someone who can do nothing for you. Game of Thrones isn’t going anywhere, I promise. Consider that your life is a credits and debits system. All the experiences, adventures, and memories you collect will put deposits into your happiness account. When you get to the end and it’s not as easy to venture into the world or try new things, you’ll need a lot of memories to draw credit against. You don’t get brownie points in life for winning at working yourself to death. Just because it’s normal to drift through your days without intentionality, doesn’t make it OK. Every breath you take is killing you. Are you making decisions today that your future self will thank you for? Remember, the happiest person in the nursing home wins.  😉 Don’t let this be another article you read and don’t take action on.

"3 Little Reminders that Will Make You Feel Way Less Alone|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/3-feel-way-less-alone.jpg?resize=500%2C334&ssl=1| In the midst of bad days and hard times, it’s easy to look around and see a bunch of people who seem to be doing perfectly fine.  But I assure you they’re not.  We’re all struggling in our own unique way, every single day.  And if we could just be brave enough to open up about it, and talk to each other more often, we’d realize that we are not alone in feeling lost and alone with our issues. So many of us are fighting a similar battle right now.  Try to remember this.  No matter how embarrassed or pathetic you feel about your own situation, there are others out there experiencing the same emotions.  When you hear yourself say, “I am all alone,” it’s just your troubled subconscious mind trying to sell you a lie. There’s always someone who can relate to you. There’s always someone who understands. Perhaps you can’t immediately talk to them, but they are out there. I am out there. The whole reason I wrote these words is because I often feel and think and struggle much like you do.  I care about many of the things you care about, just in my own way.  And although some people do not understand us, we understand each other. YOU are definitely not alone! WE are not alone! And to further assure you of this, let me tell you a quick story about a strong and beautiful woman I know who has recently felt alone, too… She notices the people sitting in a small sports bar across the street.  They’re cheering and chatting.  They look so alive.  She wants to cross the street and join these people just to connect with them – to be a part of something.  But a subtle voice that comes from within, that whispers from the open wounds in her heart, holds her back from doing so.  So she keeps walking.  Alone. She walks to the end of the city center where she sees a dirt path that leads up a grassy hill.  The hill, she knows, overlooks a spiritual sanctuary.  But it isn’t the sanctuary she wants to visit tonight – not yet anyway.  It’s a warm, breezy Saturday night and she wants to find a place outdoors with sufficient light so she can sit and read the book she’s grasping in her right hand. But reading isn’t what she really wants.  Not deep down.  What she really wants is for someone – anyone at all – to tap her on the shoulder and invite her into their world.  To ask her questions and tell her stories.  To be interested.  To understand her.  To laugh with her.  To want her to be a part of their life. But it isn’t even this connection with someone new that she wants most.  At least not at the deepest level.  At the deepest level, in the core of her soul, even fleeting connections with others seem to interfere with what she desires most.  Which is to know that she’s not alone in the world.  That she truly belongs.  And that whatever she was put here to do, in time, will be done and shared with others who deeply care. This young woman left a substantial segment of her life behind to be in this small city tonight.  A few months ago, she was engaged to a strapping young businessman, managing a fast-growing start-up company, working long, hard days and enjoying the fruits of her labor together with a deepening community of friendships in Manhattan. In a period of just a few months, her fiancé and her split and decided that it was easiest to shutdown the company and divide the monetary remains rather than attempt co-ownership.  As they began the process of shutting down the company, she learned that most of the seemingly deep friendships she had made in Manhattan were tied directly to her old business affairs or her business-socialite of an ex-fiancé. While this young woman didn’t consciously expect such a rapid, tragic series of events, it also wasn’t totally unexpected.  Subconsciously she knew that she had created a life for herself that was unsustainable.  It was a life revolving around her social status in which all of her relationships brought with them a mounting and revolving set of expectations.  This life left no time for spiritual growth or deep connection or love. Yet, this young woman is drawn to spirituality, connection and love.  She has been drawn to all three all her life.  And the only thing that steered her off course into this unsustainable lifestyle was the careless belief that if she did certain things and acted in certain ways she would be worthy in the eyes of others.  That her social status would procure lasting admiration from these people.  And that she would never feel alone. She realizes, now, how wrong she was. The young woman walks up a steep paved road on the outskirts of the city center.  She feels the burn in her calf muscles as she marches higher and higher.  The road is, at first, filled with quaint boutique shops and young couples and friends, but as it advances uphill they give way to small cottage homes and kids playing with flashlights in the street.  She keeps marching higher and higher until she reaches a clearing where there is a small public park. In this park, a group of teenagers are huddled around two guitarists who are strumming and singing an acoustic melody.  “Is it a popular song?” she thinks to herself.  She isn’t sure because she hasn’t had time lately to listen to music.  She wants to join the group.  She wants to tell the guitarists that their music is incredible.  But she hesitates.  She just can’t find the nerve to walk over to them. Instead, she sits on a park bench a few hundred feet away.  The bench overlooks the cityscape below.  She stares off into the distance and up into the night sky for several minutes, thinking and breathing.  And she begins to smile, because she can see the spiritual sanctuary.  It’s dark outside, but the sanctuary shines bright.  She can see it clearly.  She can feel its warmth surrounding her.  And although she knows the sanctuary has existed for an eternity, her heart tells her something that stretches a smile across her cheeks: “This sanctuary is all yours tonight.” Not in the sense that she owns it.  Nor in the sense that it isn’t also a sanctuary for millions of other people around the world.  But rather in the sense that it belongs to all of us as part of our heritage, exclusively tailored for every human being and our unique needs and beliefs.  It’s a quiet refuge that, when we choose to pay attention, exists all around us and within us.  We can escape to it at any time.  It’s a place where we can dwell with the good spirits and guardian angels that love us unconditionally and guide us even when we feel lost and alone. Especially when we feel lost and alone. I hope the short story above makes you feel less alone.  I hope it gives you hope.  But, assuming you need a little extra perspective right now – because sometimes we all do – I want to shift gears and cover a few practical reminders we often examine with our course students… When you look at a person, any person, remember that everyone has a story.  Everyone has gone through something that’s inadvertently changed them and forced them to grow.  Everyone you meet has struggled, and continues to struggle in some way, and to them, it’s just as hard as what you’re going through.  Yes, every passing face on the street represents a story every bit as captivating, complicated and crazy as yours. I was lucky enough to have a very wise grandmother who coached me through this reality when I was just a teenager.  And I was smart enough to write a journal entry about the conversation I had with her, so I could remember her wisdom decades later.  Let me give you a little taste of that conversation… I sat there in her living room staring at her through teary eyes.  “I feel lost and alone and completely out of my mind,” I said.  “I don’t know what’s wrong with me.” “Why do you feel that way?” she delicately asked. “Because I’m neurotic and self-conscious and regretful, and so much more all at once,” I said. “And you don’t think everyone feels the way you do sometimes?” she asked. “Not like this!” I proclaimed. “Well, honey, you’re wrong,” she said.  “If you think you know someone who never feels the way you do right now – who never feels a bit lost and alone, and downright confused and crazy – you just don’t know enough about them.  Every one of us contains a measure of ‘crazy’ that moves us in strange, often perplexing ways.  This side of us is necessary; it’s part of our human ability to think, adapt and grow.  It’s part of being intelligent,” she said.  “No great mind has ever existed without a touch of this kind of madness.” I sat silently for a moment.  My eyes gazed from her eyes to the ground and back to her eyes again.  “So you’re saying I should want to feel like this?” “To an extent,” she said.  “Let me put it this way:  Taking all your feelings seriously all the time, and letting them drive you into misery, is a waste of your incredible spirit.  You alone get to choose what matters and what doesn’t.  The meaning of everything in your life is the meaning you give it…” “I guess,” I replied under my breath. She continued, “And sometimes how you feel simply won’t align with how you want to feel – it’s mostly just your subconscious mind’s way of helping you look at things from a different perspective.  These feelings will come and go quickly as long as you let them go…as long as you consciously acknowledge them, and then push through them.  At least that’s what I’ve learned to do for myself, out of necessity, on a very regular basis.  So you and I are actually struggling through this one together, honey.  And I’m also pretty certain we’re not the only ones.” We shared another moment of silence, then my lips curled up slightly and I cracked a smile, “Thank you, Grandma,” I said.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Adversity” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) When times are tough, and some piece of you is chipped and broken, it’s easy to feel like everything – ALL of you – is broken along with it.  But that’s not true. We all have this picture in our minds of ourselves – this idea of what kind of person we are.  When this idea gets even slightly harmed or threatened, we react defensively and oftentimes irrationally.  People may question whether we did a good job, and this threatens our idea of being a competent person, so we become angry or hurt by the criticism.  Someone falsely accuses us of something and this damages our idea that we’re a good person, and so we get angry and attack the other person, or we cower and cry.  And the list goes on. But, the craziest thing is, oftentimes we are actually the ones harming and threatening ourselves with negativity and false-accusations… Just this morning I was struggling to motivate myself to work on a new creative project I’ve been procrastinating on, so my identity of myself as someone who’s always productive and motivated and has great ideas suddenly came under attack.  When I realized I wasn’t getting things done, it made me feel terribly self-conscious and uncertain because I began subconsciously worrying that I wasn’t who I thought I was.  And this in turn made me feel very alone inside. My solution was to realize that I’m not just one thing.  I’m not always productive – sometimes I am, but sometimes I’m unproductive too.  I’m not always motivated – sometimes I am, but other times I’m a bit lazy.  And obviously I don’t always have great ideas either – because that’s impossible. The truth is, I can be many things, and remembering this helps me stretch my identity so it’s not so fragile – so it doesn’t completely shatter when a small piece of it gets chipped.  Then it doesn’t matter if someone occasionally thinks I didn’t do a good job, or if I sometimes catch myself not doing a good job – because I don’t always do a good job. I make mistakes. I am less than perfect. Just like YOU. And that’s perfectly OK. I think we all have the tendency to put ourselves at the center of the universe, and see everything from the viewpoint of how it affects us.  But this can have all kinds of adverse effects, from feeling sorry for ourselves when things aren’t going exactly as planned, to doubting ourselves when we aren’t perfect, to feeling lost and alone with our issues when we’re having a bad day or going through hard times. So whenever I catch myself lingering at the center in an adverse state of mind, I do my best to briefly shift my focus, away from my own issues, and onto other people around me that I might be able to help.  Finding little ways to help others gets me out of my self-centered thinking, and then I’m not wallowing alone in self-pity anymore – I’m starting to think about what others need.  I’m not doubting myself, because the question of whether I’m good enough or not is no longer the central question.  The central question now is about what others need. Thus, thinking about others instead of oneself helps solve feelings self-consciousness and inadequacy, which in turn makes you feel a lot less broken and alone when you’re struggling. It’s one of life’s great paradoxes: when we serve others we end up benefiting as much if not more than those we serve.  So whenever you feel a bit lost and alone with your own issues, try to shift your focus from your circumstances to the circumstances of those around you.  Instead of asking, “What’s wrong with me?” ask, “How can I help you?”  Find someone who could use an extra hand and make a small, reasonable offer they can’t refuse.  The perspective you gain from doing so will guide you forward. I’d like to end this post by directly addressing my fellow souls out there who are tired and weary and struggling to find happiness at this very moment, seemingly alone. I know you’re reading this.  And I want you to know I’m writing this for YOU.  Others will be confused.  They will think I’m writing this for them.  But I’m not. This one’s for YOU. I want you to know that I understand.  Life is not always easy.  Every day can be an unpredictable challenge.  Some days it can be difficult just to get out of bed in the morning, to face reality and put on that smile.  But I want you to know that your smile has kept Angel and I going on more days than I can count.  Never forget that, even when times get tough, as they sometimes will, you are incredible, you really are. So please try to smile more often.  Even when times are hard, you have so many reasons to.  Time and time again, our reason is you. You won’t always be perfect and neither will we.  Because nobody is perfect, and nobody deserves to be perfect.  Everybody has issues.  Nobody has it easy.  You will never know exactly what we’re going through, and we will never know exactly what you’re going through.  We are all fighting our own unique war. But we are fighting through it simultaneously, together. If someone discredits you and tells you that you can’t do something, keep in mind that they are speaking from within the boundaries of their own limitations.  In this crazy world that’s trying to make you like everyone else, find the courage to keep being your awesome self.  And when they laugh at you for being different, go ahead and laugh back at them for being the same. Remember, our courage doesn’t always roar aloud.  Sometimes it’s the quiet voice at the end of the day whispering, “I will try again tomorrow.”  So stand strong.  Things turn out best for people who make the best out of the way things turn out. And Angel and I are committed to making the best of it along with YOU. One day at a time, one tiny step at a time, for the rest of our lives.  (Angel and I build tiny, daily, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.)

The happiness of your life depends on the quality of your thoughts.  The mind is indeed your battleground.  It’s the place where the greatest conflict resides.  It’s where half of the chaos you thought was real, never did happen.  But if you allow these thoughts to dwell in your mind, they will succeed in robbing you of peace, joy, and ultimately your sanity.  You will think yourself into a nervous breakdown, into bouts of depression, and into defeat. There’s no escaping the fact that you are what you think – that you can’t change anything if you can’t change your thinking. But are you ready for some really good news? You CAN change your thinking. And mornings are one of the simplest times for making this change gradually transpire in your life. Each morning is enormously important.  It’s the foundation from which the day is built.  How you choose to spend your morning can be used to predict the kind of day you’re going to have. So when you first wake up, be mindful and take a second to think about what a privilege it is to simply be alive and healthy.  Breathe onto the bathroom mirror, just to see how amazing your breath looks.  The moment you start acting like life is a blessing, I assure you it will start to feel like one.  And when you start the day in a mindful state like this, it’s easier to focus effectively and step into the day on the right foot. But, on many mornings, of course, this is far easier said than done. So, to help you adjust your mindset first thing every morning, I offer you the 52 morning meditations below – one for each week of the year (note: you can start your year of morning meditations anytime you want).  I choose one new meditation every Monday morning and sit quietly for three minutes, repeating it silently in my mind as if I were meditating.  I also write it on a post-it note and stick it next to my work desk (where I can see it) for the duration of the week.  This little ritual has helped reduce stress and chaos in my life by reminding me to keep things simple, peaceful and in perspective. There’s little doubt that the biggest and most complex obstacle you will ever have to overcome on any given day is your mind.  If you can overcome that, you can overcome almost anything.  And while the meditations above are a perfect start, there’s something else I want you to remember too – something we coach our course students through almost every single day… No matter what’s happening, you can efficiently fight the battles of just one day.  It’s only when you add the battles of those two abysmal eternities, yesterday and tomorrow, that life gets overwhelmingly complicated. Realize that it’s not the experience of today that creates most of the chaos in your life, but the regret and resentment about something that happened yesterday or the fear and dread of what tomorrow might bring. It’s necessary, therefore, to let yourself live just one day at a time – just today – just right here, right now. Trust the timing of your life. Focus on the present. And just do the best you can. If you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU. Which morning meditation mentioned above resonates the most with you right now, and why? Anything else to share?

You’re anxious about what other people – family, friends, colleagues and strangers alike – might think of you.  You pass people on the street and, without even realizing it, you worry about how you look in their eyes. You worry about your responsibilities at work (emails, meetings, paperwork, etc.), and all the obligations you have in your personal life (family, meals, bills, etc.).  And you have this constant aching feeling that you’re not doing enough… that you’re not as good as you ‘should’ be, and you never will be. You worry about how you compare to other people, about how far behind you are, about how good or bad you’ll be going forward, about all the things you don’t have, about what you’re missing out on, about how guilty you feel for not being better, skinnier, stronger and smarter than you are right now. And so it goes… But you’re not alone.  We all get caught up in our own heads sometimes. What you need to realize is that, regardless of what’s going on in your life, there’s a good chance you’ll be just fine. The world will keep turning, and life will be OK. We’re always obsessing over things that might go wrong, about the disheartening things people might think about us, and so on and so forth.  In a nutshell, we’re focused on the negative possibilities only. But those negative possibilities are just a few small possibilities out of a pool of many.  So the chances of them becoming a reality are slim.  And even if one of them does become a reality (let’s say somebody thinks poorly of you), the negative impact of this reality is rarely as disastrous as we imagine. The truth is, even if our fears transpire, 99% of the time we’ll be fine. Try to envision all the little things you’ve worried about recently.  You survived every single one of these possibilities, right?  Life didn’t fall apart, and even when you were forced to struggle for a while, you learned some useful lessons that ultimately made you stronger. If you simply make a positive ritual of telling yourself that you’ll be fine – and that you are fine right now – you can gradually let go of your worries the moment you notice them arising. You can think better and you can ultimately live better… You can start your day with a sense of peace in your mind, a genuine smile on your face, and then you can put your best foot forward. All of this is true and worth practicing. But… How do you cope then? Let me share a quick, relevant story with you… “Today, on my 47th birthday, I re-read the suicide note I wrote on my 27th birthday about two minutes before my girlfriend, Carol, showed up at my apartment and told me, ‘I’m pregnant.’  Her words were honestly the only reason I didn’t follow through with it.  Suddenly I felt I had something to live for, and I started making positive changes.  It’s been a journey, but Carol is now my wife and we’ve been happily married for 19 years.  And my daughter, who is now a 21-year-old university student pursuing a degree in medicine, has two younger brothers.  I re-read my suicide note every year on the morning of my birthday as a reminder to be graceful – I am grateful I got a second chance at life.” That’s the opening paragraph of an email I received recently from a course student named Kevin.  His words remind me that sometimes you have to die a little on the inside first in order to be reborn and rise again as a stronger, happier version of yourself. Circumstances and people will occasionally break you down to the lowest of lows.  But if you keep your mind focused on the positive, your heart open to love, and continue to put one foot in front of the other, you can recover the pieces, rebuild, and come back much stronger and happier than you ever would have been otherwise. Angel and I have dealt with our fair share of adversity too – losing siblings and best friends to death, financial and business turmoil, etc. – and we’ve written a lot about it over the years.  But today, let me remind you of some clear signs that you will be just fine, even if you don’t feel fine right now… Everything in life is temporary.  Nothing lasts.  Every moment gives us a new beginning and a new ending.  We literally get a second chance every second. Every time it rains, it stops raining.  Everything that goes up comes down.  After darkness there is always light – we are reminded of this every morning, but somehow we don’t see it. People all over the world are constantly telling their one heartbreaking story, about how their entire life has turned into an exercise in coping with one particular unfair event from the past.  Every present opportunity they have is then burned at the stake to fuel a fiery obsession with something that can’t be changed.  The key is to realize that YOU don’t have to be one of these people. You are a product of your past, but you don’t have to be a prisoner of it.  You become a prisoner when you cling to what no longer exists.  So remember that if you’re brave enough to say goodbye, life will reward you with a new hello.  It may be hard, but you CAN let go… and to a certain degree, you must. You have to let go and accept the feeling of not knowing exactly where you’re going next, and train yourself to love and appreciate this freedom.  Because it is only when you are suspended in the air, with no destination in sight, that you force your wings to open fully so you can fly.  And as you soar around you still may not know where you’re traveling to.  But that’s not what’s important.  What’s important is the opening of your wings.  You may not know where you’re headed, but you know that so long as your wings are spread, the winds will carry you forward.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Adversity” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Oftentimes we yearn for just a tiny range of life experiences – the good times, the comfortable situations, the experiences that make us happy.  And yet, the reality we’re faced with every day is quite different.  Life gives us a broad range of very different experiences that gradually wrap our emotions up in anger and love and heartbreak and joy and frustration and excitement and loneliness and confusion… one after another.  These are all part of our reality – our collective human condition. The question is: How will YOU choose to respond? You can revolt against the unfairness of having to deal with not getting everything you want.  You can be angry at the world for the pain and struggle you’re faced with.  You can attempt to resist and deny the experiences of sadness, frustration, confusion, and so forth.  Just beware that all of these choices will ultimately lead you in spiraling circles of deeper and darker despair. A more effective choice, perhaps, is to fully embrace reality and the broad range of life experiences you encounter, taking the good with the bad.  This includes all of your emotions, all of your ups and downs, all of your blissful moments and painful ones, and the entirety of everything in between. Life is not just rainbows and butterflies.  It’s intricate and remarkable. Fully embracing life in this way means opening yourself to unimaginable possibilities, being vulnerable to unexpected changes, being compassionate with yourself when times are tough, giving yourself some extra love and kindness no matter what happens, and being grateful for the opportunity to experience it all. It means not expecting to always be the perfect human living the perfect life, but instead accepting reality as it is, and accepting yourself as you are, and then making the best of it. Don’t build mountains in your mind.  Don’t try to conquer the world all at once.  When you seek instant gratification (big, quick fixes) you make life unnecessarily painful and frustrating.  When you choose instead to treat each moment as an opportunity to make a tiny, positive investment in yourself, the rewards come naturally. When everything is broken, it’s easy to find plenty of little things you can fix.  When nothing seems to be going right, even the most fundamental positive effort can make a significant difference.  Times of great adversity are also times of great opportunity.  When there are problems in every direction, there is also great value waiting to be created.  When everything is going well, it’s easy to get lulled into a routine of complacency.  It’s easy to forget how incredibly capable and resourceful you can be.  Resolve to persevere one small step at a time. Small steps, little leaps, and tiny fixes (very small repetitive changes) every day will get you there, every time, through thick and thin. If you’d like to get started now, challenge yourself to do so.  Choose a specific area of your life that you want to improve, and then… The bottom line is that every moment of your life builds upon the next.  This moment is the bridge between the reality of where you are and the vision of where you want to be. Reality is indeed approaching you every second.  And the great thing is, you’re able to alter it as it arrives.  You just have to decide what you want to do with it.  The greatest of all mistakes is to do nothing simply because you can only do a little right now.  And again, it is far more productive to take many small steps in the right direction than to make a giant leap only to stumble and fall and never get up again.  The path to what you want most in life requires a ritual of a thousand small steps spread out over time.  Figure out where you want to go, take the first step, and keep on stepping.  Diligence and persistence will get you there.  (Angel and I build daily, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.) Most of us are familiar with the practice of loving and caring for our parents, children, or significant others.  And although we do so imperfectly, we do our best to practice this love for them on a daily basis. But do we attempt to practice the same level of love and care with ourselves? Oftentimes the answer is NO.  Think about it… I’ll be the first to admit that I still struggle with all the above.  And I know I’m not the only one.  For many of us, there’s an underlying feeling of being less than we think we should be.  This isn’t something we consciously do to ourselves, but it happens, again and again.  And we CAN choose differently! YOU can choose differently! Today, what if you started practicing a little more self-love, self-care, and self-acceptance?  What if you took a good look at yourself, your body, your feelings, your situation, and told yourself, “You are perfectly fine!  You are enough!  You are worth it”? How would doing so change your attitude and life? Seriously think about the possibility of accepting everything about yourself, just as you are right now, without yearning to change yourself in any way. It’s important to note, too, that accepting yourself the way you are is not about complacency and inaction.  It’s about realizing that you can’t hate and berate yourself into a better version of yourself.  Positive growth is built on a foundation of love and acceptance.   The person who loves herself (or himself) is more likely to take positive actions that move things forward for all the right reasons. In the end, you will change no matter what.  Nothing lasts.  You simply can’t avoid changing with the times.  The question is whether the change you experience in life comes from a place of love and acceptance, or a place of self-loathing and resistance. I vote for love and acceptance. But the choice is YOURS to make. If you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU. Which point mentioned above resonates with you the most today, and why?

One Thing Real Love Never Does to You|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/1-thing-real-love.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| "
"3 Toxic Behaviors that Drain Your Mental Energy|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/3-toxic-mental-energy.jpg?resize=500%2C396&ssl=1| Let me share three quick stories and some life-changing lessons with you… These stories have been transcribed with permission from coaching sessions we’ve recently conducted with three of our course students.  And if there’s one thing these students’ stories have it common, it’s the importance of our mental perspective. What we see in life – how we feel about ourselves, our lives, and the people around us – greatly depends on how we think. And the somewhat scary truth is, our mental perspective on just about everything comes from the psychological cage we’ve been conditioned to live in.  A cage created by… And gradually, unbeknownst to us, our cage – our conditioning – drains our mental energy, leaving us vulnerable to bad decision-making. So, what can we do about this? How do we free our minds? There’s not a one-size-fits-all answer.  But if you’re looking for a smart place to start, your best bet is to take a general assessment of your life and, if necessary, stop one or more of the three toxic behaviors covered below.  We’ve literally seen these three, related behaviors plaguing hundreds of our coaching clients and course students over the past decade.  The root cause of each is largely fueled by a limited mental perspective. Letting go of control…  and being OK with it. That is one of the greatest struggles many of us deal with on a daily basis, myself included. Because letting go of control goes directly against our modernized, industrialized way of living – we are go-getters, doers, architects of our destiny.  We build things and make things happen on our own terms; we don’t wait for anything to happen on someone else’s terms!  At least that’s what I learned growing up from teachers, sports coaches, movies, songs, magazine articles, and so forth.  So allowing things to happen was not in my DNA.  I had never been one to sit back and passively let go of control. Over the years, however, my perspective has shifted.  I’ve learned the hard way that a great deal of the control we believe we have over our lives is an illusion.  For example, I’ve since met… It happens every day – situations we think we have control over, but we really don’t. So what can we do? The only choice we have: Let go, and be mindful… In the game of life, we all receive a unique set of unexpected limitations and variables in the field of play.  The question is: How will you respond to the hand you’ve been dealt?  You can either focus on the lack thereof or empower yourself to play the game sensibly and resourcefully, making the very best of every outcome as it arises, even when it’s heartbreaking and hard to accept. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the mind is our biggest battleground.  It’s the place where the strongest conflict resides.  It’s where half of the things we thought were going to happen, never did happen.  It’s where our expectations always get the best of us.  It’s where we fall victim to our cravings to control the uncontrollable.  And if we allow these thoughts and cravings to dwell in our minds, they will succeed in robbing us of peace, joy, and ultimately our lives.  We will think ourselves into deep heartache and even depression. Truthfully, there’s so much about life that we can’t control, it makes no sense to waste all our energy on these things and then blatantly neglect everything we CAN control. We can choose how we spend our time right now.  We can choose gratitude and grace.  We can choose whom we socialize with – whom we share this day of our lives with.  We can choose to love and appreciate the people in our lives for exactly who they are.  We can choose to love and appreciate ourselves too.  We can choose how we’re going to respond to life’s surprises and disappointments when they arise, and whether we will see them as curses or opportunities for personal growth. And, perhaps most importantly, we can choose to adjust our attitudes and let go of all our worries about everything we can’t control, which in turn frees us up to take the next best step forward in our lives. But what happens if you don’t? What happens if you refuse to let go? Gradually, you will drain nearly every bit of your mental energy, as you consume yourself with… When life has to be a certain way in order to be good enough for you, you instantly close yourself off from all the real and present opportunities available – you spend all your mental energy resisting life, rather than making the best of it. And sadly, this is how the vast majority of the human population lives – stuck in a perpetual cycle of resistance. But YOU DON’T have to continue this cycle. Again, you can free your mind! When you consciously choose to let go of the way it “should” be, you free your mind to deal with life’s unexpected changes, challenges and chaos in the most effective way possible… You create space for acceptance, learning and growth. You learn from your mistakes and the mistakes of others. You see the world through an unbiased set of eyes. And gradually, you allow yourself to step forward with a clear and focused mind. It’s all about accepting what is, letting go of what was, and having faith in your journey. Closing the door, completing the chapter, turning the page, etc. – it doesn’t matter what you title it…what matters is that you find the strength to leave in the past those parts of your life that are over, so you can better attend to the present. What has happened is uncontrollable; what you do now changes everything! Of course, knowing this and actually living a lifestyle that reinforces this truth are two very different things.  Letting go – changing the way you think – is NOT easy; it’s a journey that is traveled one day at a time. It can be excruciatingly difficult to leave a long-term life situation behind, even when your inner-wisdom tells you that things aren’t right and that it’s time to let go.  At this point, you can choose to let go and endure the sudden pain of leaving behind the familiar to make way for a new chapter in your life, or you can stay and suffer a constant, aching pain that gradually eats away at your heart and mind like a cancer… until you wake up one day and find yourself buried so deep in the dysfunction of the situation that you barely remember who you are and what you desire. Choose wisely! Things will happen that are unexpected, undesirable, and uncontrollable.  But you can always choose to take the next tiniest step.  Be brave and take it… Choose to make mistakes, learn from them, let go of them, and move along. Choose to think better about the past and present, so you can consciously make the best of the rest of your life. Choose to stop… The two points covered above directly lead to this one – whenever we demand control over the uncontrollable, or stubbornly resist the present reality of our lives, needless drama ensues. Drama is simply the consequence of our inner conflicts with outer incidents. Thus, the drama you are going through at any given moment is not fueled by the words or deeds of others, or any external sources at all; it is fueled primarily by your mind that gives the drama importance. And yes, we all do this to ourselves sometimes. But why? Why do we get so easily stressed out and sucked into drama? It’s because the world isn’t the predictable, orderly, blissful place we’d like it to be.  We want things to be easy, comfortable and well ordered 24/7.  Unfortunately, sometimes work is hectic, relationships are challenging, people demand our time, we aren’t as prepared as we’d like to be, our family frustrates us, and there’s just too much to do and learn and process in our minds. So our inner conflict begins to boil over. But, again, the problem isn’t the world, or other people’s thoughts and behavior – these aspects of life will always be a bit of an unpredictable mess. The problem is that we’re holding on too tightly to ideals that don’t match reality.  We have subconsciously set up expectations in our minds of what we want other people to be, what we want ourselves to be, and what our work and relationships and life “should” be like.  Our attachment to our ideals stirs anxiety in our minds and stress in our lives. In other words, our resistance to accept things as they are fuels our drama. And we don’t want to be a part of this drama – at least that’s what we tell ourselves – so we blame others for it … which in turn creates even more of it. But there’s good news!  We can let go of drama, and find peace with reality. How? I’m going to suggest a simple practice for whenever you feel stress, resistance, frustration, worry, and all the other draining mindsets that fuel drama in your life: Focus, carefully, on what you’re feeling.  Don’t numb it with distractions, but instead bring it further into your awareness. Turn to it, and welcome it.  Smile, and give what you feel your full, thoughtful attention. Notice the feeling in your body.  Where is the feeling situated, and what unique qualities does it have? Notice the tension in your body, and also in your mind, that arises from this feeling. Try relaxing the tense parts of your body.  Then relax the tense parts of your mind.  Do so by focusing on your breath: Close your eyes, breathe in and feel it, breathe out and feel it, again and again, until you feel more relaxed. In this more relaxed state, find some quiet space within yourself.  And in this space… Take time to just sit with the inner peace these two simple rediscoveries bring. This is the practice of letting go of drama, and simply accepting this moment as it is, and yourself as you are. You can do this anytime, wherever you are.  You can practice focusing on the goodness in others as well.  Seeing the goodness in your challenges and relationships and work, and so on and so forth. You can build a healthy daily ritual of stopping the needless drama in your life, and rediscovering the peace and joy and love that are always just a few thoughts away. (Note: Angel and I build healthy, life-changing daily rituals like this with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.) If you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU. Which point mentioned above resonates with you the most today, and why? Have you ever struggled with one of these toxic behaviors?

All the results in your life come from the little things. Regardless of your unique life circumstances, or how you define success, you don’t suddenly become successful.  You become successful over time from all the little things you do every day. Failure occurs in the same way.  All your little daily failures (that you don’t learn and grow from) come together and cause you to fail… And then one day you wake up and your business has failed, and you’re stressed out beyond belief.  It was all the little things you did or didn’t do along the way, not just one inexplicable, catastrophic event. Think about how this example relates to your life. Your life is your business! And all the little things – if not corrected – become big things, over time. Even the seemingly insignificant aspects of your life can produce ripples of consequence – for better or worse. So, how are you managing your life? Are the little things you’re doing every day working for you or against you? If you think the answer might be the latter, you will find incredible value in the five strategies below.  These strategies gradually strengthen common weak points we’ve seen plaguing thousands of our course students, coaching clients, and live event attendees over the past decade – little things people do every day that stress them out and stop them from moving forward with their lives. And remember, this article is about making little, sustainable shifts in your behavior.  That means practicing each one of these strategies gradually – one at time, one day at a time, and then letting them build on one another.  Go from zero to five over the course of several months, not all at once. The best time to take a deep breath is when you don’t have time for it.  Period! Too often, however, we’re told the exact opposite. Hustling is a celebrated state of being in our modern culture. Hustle, hustle, and get things done – get to the top of the ladder as fast as possible! And while hustling can help you fail forward at a faster pace, too many of us spend the vast majority of our lives climbing the ladder of success only reach the top and discover that the ladder was leaning against the wrong wall.  This happens primarily because we’re always hustling around and rushing so fast that we’re utterly exhausted when it comes time to make some of life’s most important decisions.  So we end up selecting the ladder that’s closest and easiest to climb, which also happens the one we don’t really need or want to climb. Ultimately, many of us eventually realize that it’s better to be at the bottom of the ladder you want to climb than the top of the one you don’t.  Do you best to take this to heart right now.  There’s absolutely no reason to be in such a mad rush that you end up at the top of the wrong ladder – pursuing someone else’s agenda instead of your own. Dedicate time every day to focus inward – mindfulness rituals, mantras, journaling, prayer, gratitude reflection, etc. – and bring clarity to your daily circumstances and decisions.  By doing so you will undoubtedly open your mind to important ideas and opportunities you simply can’t comprehend in the midst of mindless hustle. Just this morning, for example, I took a break from hustling and spent 30 minutes journaling about the recent events in my life that I’m grateful for, and some recent events that are still troubling me.  As I was wrapping up, the idea for the blog post you’re reading now came to me, which was a pleasant surprise since I hadn’t yet decided what I was going to write about and share with you today. I also unearthed some incredibly healthy insights regarding an important relationship that I had been neglecting, which motivated me to immediately send out a text message to someone I care about who I’ve been meaning to reconnect with for nearly six months.  We now have a brunch date scheduled for next Sunday. So, as you can tell, your time spent focusing inward and finding clarity doesn’t just help you – your mind is powerful and your thoughts create ripples in the world around you.  When you bring clarity into your life, you bring the best of yourself into everything you do – you tend to treat yourself and others better, communicate more constructively, do things for the right reasons, and ultimately improve the world you’re living in.  This is why praying, or just meditating on some positive mantras, on a daily basis can actually make a real-world difference in your life. The bottom line is that a slower pace and a heightened level of your conscious awareness – mental clarity – instantly elevates you in countless ways.  And then interesting things begin happening – good things that are outside of your immediate purview – good things you haven’t even thought of yet. As they say, “Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending.”  Nothing could be closer to the truth.  But before you can begin this process of transformation you have to stop doing the things that have been holding you back. When you stop chasing the wrong things, you give the right things a chance to catch you. It’s all about getting organized and conscious of how you are allocating your limited time and energy, so you can put yourself in a position to build the future you want. Think about your own life and the lives of those close to you.  Most of us have a tendency to do as much as we possibly can – cramming every waking minute with events, extravagances, tasks and obligations.  And we just keep running in place. We think doing more will get us more satisfaction, success, etc.  When oftentimes the exact opposite is true. In his book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen Covey explains that some things in life are important, and some things are just urgent.  Most people spend the vast majority of their lives working on urgent, unimportant activities. Very few people have focused their time and energy in a way that exclusively prioritizes truly important and meaningful objectives over everything else that pops up. Less is indeed more! Thus, the smartest and most effective way to move forward in life is not doing more, but instead doing less by stopping the behaviors that are holding you back. Obviously, this principle can be universally applied in your life, and it’s all a matter of getting crystal clear about what matters, and what’s just getting in the way. Rise above the needless excess trying to draw you in. Where attention goes, energy flows.  Where energy flows, things grow. Organize yourself. Focus on what matters. And get rid of everything else. Do less… and make the less you do count for even more. Some things are worth changing.  Most things aren’t. Let this be your wake-up call! “If you want to control your animals, give them a larger pasture.”  That’s a quote I heard at a meditation retreat several years ago in a group discussion focused on the power of changing your attitude about the things you can’t change or don’t need to change. I see “the animals” and their “larger pasture” as a form of letting go and allowing things to be the way they are – instead of trying to tightly control something, you’re loosening up, giving it more space, a larger pasture.  The animals will be happier – they will roam around and do what they naturally do.  And yet your needs will be met too – you will have more space to be at peace with the way the animals are. This same philosophy holds true for many aspects of life – stepping back and allowing certain things to happen means these things will take care of themselves, and your needs will also be met.  You will have less stress (and less to do), and more time and energy to work on the things that truly matter  – the things you actually can control – like your attitude about everything. This form of letting go is not giving up.  It’s about surrendering any obsessive attachment to particular people, outcomes and situations.  It means showing up every day in your life with the intention to be your best self, and to do the best you know how, without expecting life to go a certain way.  Have goals, have dreams, aspire and take purposeful action, and build great relationships, but detach from what every aspect of your life must absolutely look like to be “good enough” for you. The energy of someone aspiring to create something wonderful, teamed with this kind of surrender, is far more powerful and rewarding than someone determined to create outcomes with a desperate ‘must have’ mentality.  Surrender brings inner peace and joy, and lest we forget that our outer lives are a reflection of our inner state of being.  (Angel and I discuss this in detail in the “Simplicity” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Our big goals are important.  But too often we spend our time and energy thinking about the desired end results of a big goal, instead of actually doing the little things that need to be done today. How many days go by where you have nothing to show it – where not even the slightest bit of progress was made toward any of your goals? Probably too many to count. Let this be another wake-up call for you.  If you don’t intentionally carve out time every day to make progress, you won’t? –? without question, your time will get lost in the vacuum of excessive overthinking and distraction.  Before you know it, you’ll be tired and withered, wondering where all your time went, and wishing you could have another chance. Today is your chance! And all you have to do is take one small step today, and then another one tomorrow. It’s all about turning your big goals into small, actionable daily rituals. If you’re not willing to make it a daily ritual – and actually work on it a little bit every day – you don’t really want to improve your life as much as you say you do.  You only like the idea of learning to be fit/writing a book/building a business/selling your art/etc.  You don’t actually want to DO it. But, if you DO want it as much as you say you do, here’s how to make it a daily ritual: Let’s look at a few super common goals we typically have as human beings in the modern age: How do you turn those big goals into small daily rituals?  Think about what you could do every day that would get you closer to your desired outcome, even if it were only the tiniest imaginable step forward.  Of course, this is not always easy to figure out, but let’s look at some ideas: You get the idea.  Not all of these specific rituals will work for you and your unique situation, but you could come up with something similar that works better for you.  In any case, the principle applies: Create a small, actionable ritual and live by it daily. (Note: Angel and I build small, actionable, life-changing daily rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.) Overlooking everything that’s wonderful is a tragedy – a very stressful one.  So, as mentioned in point #3 above, do your best and surrender the rest.  When you get lost in worried thoughts about a life situation you think you “should” have, you end up missing the beauty of what you do have.  And you will have a hard time ever being happy if you aren’t thankful for the good things in your life right now. Here’s a super simple, five-minute daily gratitude exercise that has worked wonders for thousands of our course students and coaching clients over the past decade: Every evening before you go to bed, write down three things that went well during the day and their causes.  Simply provide a short, causal explanation for each good thing. That’s it. We spend tens of thousands of dollars on expensive electronics, big homes, fancy cars and lavish vacations hoping for a boost of happiness.  This is a free alternative, and it works. In a study of this gratitude exercise’s effectiveness by the famed psychologist Martin Seligman, participants were asked to follow those exact instructions for just one week.  After one week the participants were measurably 2% happier than before, but in follow-up tests their happiness kept on increasing, from 5% at one month, to 9% at six months.  Even more interestingly, the participants were only required to keep this gratitude journal for one week, but the majority of them continued journaling on their own because they enjoyed it. I tried it for myself many years ago – I set a goal of doing it for just one week, and I’m still doing it today.  So I can assure you, it’s addictively effective. Does the walker choose the path, or does the path choose the walker?  Believe it or not, in the end quite often it’s the latter. In fact, that’s one of the most valuable aspects of the strategies discussed above – by focusing inward, dropping excess baggage, letting go of the uncontrollable, building sustainable daily rituals, and appreciating what’s going well, you give yourself the perspective and momentum needed to cope with the unexpected twists and turns on the path in front of you.  And yes, oftentimes the immediate path chooses you, not the other way around.  And that’s not a bad thing either. Some of the greatest outcomes that transpire in your life will be the ones you never even knew you wanted.  As long as you keep your mind open to new perspectives and yourself moving forward, there really are no wrong turns in life, only paths you didn’t know you were meant to walk.  And you never can be certain what’s around the corner.  It could be everything, or it could be nothing.  You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you realize you’ve come a long way from where you started. All details aside, someday all the pieces will come together.  Unimaginably good outcomes will likely transpire in your life, even if everything doesn’t turn out exactly the way you had anticipated.  And you will look back at the times that have passed, smile widely, and ask yourself… “How in the world did I get through all of that?” If you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU.

You Need to Do These 2 Hard Things to Be Happy|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/2-hard-things-happy.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. Deep down you know this is true. You have to do hard things to be happy in life.  The things most people are avoiding.  The things that frighten you and make you uncomfortable.  The things others can’t do for you.  The things that make you question how much longer you can hold on and push forward. Why? Because those are the things that ultimately define you.  Those are the things that make the difference between existing and living – between knowing the path and walking the path – between a life of mediocrity and a life filled with progress and fulfillment. Of course, the hard things are often the easiest things to avoid.  To distract yourself.  To procrastinate.  To make excuses.  To pretend like they somehow don’t apply to you and your life situation. But reality always rears its head in the end.  And the truth about how ordinary people achieve immense happiness and incredible feats of success is that they step out of their comfort zones and do the hard things that their more privileged, talented and qualified peers don’t have the courage, drive or determination to do. So for your own sake, start doing the hard things TODAY.  I guarantee, you will be blown away at just how remarkable you really are and just how amazing your life can be, both personally and professionally. Angel and I recorded this quick candid conversation for you, to give you an idea of how we’re presently applying the concept of “doing the hard things to be happy” in our daily lives:  As you can tell from the video, how you apply the concept of “doing the hard things to be happy” can vary greatly.  But if you’re looking for a place to start, let me make two simple (but not easy) recommendations… Think about the most common problems we deal with in our lives – from lack of presence to lack of exercise to unhealthy diets to procrastination, and so forth.  In most cases, problems like these are not caused not by a physical ailment, but by a weakness of the mind – a weakness of our self-discipline. Just like every muscle in the body, the mind needs to be exercised to gain strength.  It needs to be worked consistently to grow and develop over time.  If you haven’t pushed yourself in hundreds of little ways over time, of course you’ll crumble on the one day that things get slightly challenging. But it doesn’t have to be that way.  You have a choice… You can choose to pay attention when it would be easier to pick up your phone.  You can choose to go to the gym when it would be more comfortable to sleep in.  You can choose to create something special when it would be quicker to consume something mediocre.  You can choose to raise your hand and ask that question when it would take less nerve to stay silent.  You can prove to yourself, in hundreds of little ways, that you have the guts to get in the ring and wrestle with life. Mental strength is built through lots of small, daily victories.  It’s the individual choices we make day-to-day that build our “mental strength” muscles.  We all want this kind of strength, but we can’t wish our way to it.  If you want it, you have to create positive daily rituals in your life that reinforce what you desire.  And that means you must learn to consistently exercise your self-discipline accordingly. Self-discipline is a skill to be honed.  It is the ability to overcome distractions and get the right things done.  It involves acting according to what you know is right instead of how you feel in the moment (perhaps tired or lazy).  And it typically requires sacrificing immediate pleasure and excitement for what matters most in life. A lack of self-discipline for most of us is simply the result of a lack of focus.  In other words, we tell ourselves we are going to do something, but then we don’t.  When this happens to me, first and foremost, I forgive myself for messing up, and then I strive to be mindful about what’s really going on.  Am I procrastinating for some reason?  Am I distracted?  Instead of telling myself that I’m “bad” or “undisciplined,” I try to productively uncover a more specific, solvable problem, and then address it. But… What do you do if your life is in complete disarray, you have hardly any self-discipline or consistent daily rituals, can’t stick to anything, procrastinate constantly, and feel completely out of control? How do you get started with building a healthy ritual of self-discipline when you have so many changes to make? You start small.  Very small. If you don’t know where to start, let me suggest that you start by simply washing your dishes.  Yes, I mean literally washing your dishes.  It’s just one small step forward:  When you eat your oatmeal, wash your bowl and spoon.  When you finish drinking your morning coffee, rinse the coffee pot and your mug.  Don’t leave any dirty dishes in the sink or on the counter for later.  Wash them immediately. Form this ritual one dish at a time, one day at a time.  Once you do this consistently for a few weeks, you can start making sure the sink has been wiped clean too.  Then the counter.  Then put your clothes where they belong when you take them off.  Then start doing a few sit-ups every morning.  Eat a few vegetables for dinner.  And so forth. Do one of these at a time, and you’ll start to build a healthy ritual of self-discipline, and finally know yourself to be capable of doing what must be done… and finishing what you start. But, again, for right now, just wash your dishes.  Mindfully, with a smile. (Note: Angel and I build small, life-changing daily rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.) Over the past decade, as Angel and I have gradually worked with hundreds of our course students, coaching clients, and live event attendees, we’ve come to understand that the root cause of most human stress is simply our stubborn propensity to hold on to stressful thoughts.  In a nutshell, we hold on tight to the hope that things will go exactly as we imagine, and then we complicate our lives to no end when our imagination doesn’t represent reality. So how can we let go and live better? By realizing that there’s nothing to hold on to in the first place. Most of the things – situations, problems, worries, ideals, expectations, etc. – we desperately try to hold on to, as if they’re real, solid, everlasting fixtures in our lives, aren’t really there.  Or if they are there in some form, they’re changing, fluid, impermanent, or mostly created in our minds. Life gets significantly easier to deal with when we understand this. Imagine you’re blindfolded and treading water in the center of a large swimming pool, and you’re struggling desperately to grab the edge of the pool that you think is nearby, but really it’s not – it’s far away.  Trying to grab that imaginary edge is stressing you out, and tiring you out, as you splash around aimlessly trying to hold on to something that isn’t there. Now imagine you pause, take a deep breath, and realize that there’s nothing nearby to hold on to.  Just water around you.  You can continue to struggle with grabbing at something that doesn’t exist… or you can accept that there’s only water around you, and relax, and float. This is the art of letting go.  And it starts with your thinking… What you have to remember is that just because the world around you is confusing and chaotic, doesn’t mean the world within you has to be too. You can get rid of all the confusion and chaos inside you created by others, the past, uncontrollable events, or your general frame of mind… Just by being a simple witness of your thoughts. It’s about being silent, and witnessing the thoughts passing through you.  Just witnessing at first, not interfering and not even judging, because by judging too rapidly you have lost the pure witness.  The moment you rush to say, “this is good” or “this is bad,” you have already grabbed ahold of the chaos. It takes a little time to create a gap between the witnessing of thoughts and your reaction to them.  Once the gap is there, though, you are in for a great surprise – that you are not the thoughts themselves, nor the chaos influencing them.  You are the witness, a watcher, who’s capable of letting go, changing your mind, and rising above the turmoil. And this process of thought-watching is the very alchemy of true mindfulness.  Because as you become more and more deeply rooted in witnessing, the confusing, chaotic thoughts start disappearing. You are thinking, but the mind is empty of senseless chatter. You are floating, with no extra weight and a lot less effort. It’s a moment of enlightenment – a moment that you become, perhaps for the first time, an unconditioned, sane, truly free human being. So today, let this be your reminder to let all the small annoyances go.  Move through your day consciously.  Make an effort to notice at least one insignificant little frustration that you would normally get frustrated about.  Then do yourself a favor and simply let it go.  Experience, in this little way, the freedom of being in control of the way you feel.  And realize that you can extend this same level of control to every situation you encounter in life. At almost any given moment, the way you feel is the way you choose to feel, and the way you react is the way you choose to react. When you think better, you live better. And life gets happier. If you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU. Which point mentioned above resonates with you the most today, and why? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

This morning a seasoned psychology professor walked up on stage to teach one final lesson – a stress management principle – to an auditorium filled with students who were about to graduate from college.  As she raised a glass of water over her head, everyone expected her to mention the typical “glass half empty or glass half full” metaphor.  Instead, with a smile on her face, the professor asked, “How heavy is this glass of water I’m holding?” Students shouted out answers ranging from a couple ounces to a couple pounds. After a moment of fielding answers and nodding her head, she replied, “From my perspective, the absolute weight of this glass is irrelevant.  It all depends on how long I hold it.  If I hold it for a minute or two, it’s fairly light.  If I hold it for an hour straight, its weight might make my arm ache.  If I hold it for a day straight, my arm will likely cramp up and feel completely numb and paralyzed, forcing me to drop the glass to the floor.  In each case, the absolute weight of the glass doesn’t change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it feels to me.” As the class shook their heads in agreement, she continued, “Your worries, frustrations, and stressful thoughts are very much like this glass of water.  Think about them for a little while and nothing drastic happens.  Think about them a bit longer and you begin to feel noticeable pain.  Think about them all day long, and you will feel completely numb and paralyzed – incapable of doing anything else until you drop them.” Let this professor’s words be your wake-up call. If you’ve been struggling to cope with the weight of what’s on your mind, it’s a strong sign that it’s time to put the glass down. The key is to realize that the worries, frustrations, and stressful thoughts you’re dealing with are entirely a product of your own creation.  And you can let them go almost instantly by adjusting your attitude.  Today, I challenge you to do just that – to replace your negative thoughts with positive alternatives.  Take a look at the quotes below that I’ve carefully selected from our blog’s archive.  Pick one (or more) of them that relates to your present circumstances, and use it as a mantra by repeating it to yourself the moment you feel negativity creeping up inside you. Above all, the mantras in this post collectively serve as a healthy coping mechanism for life’s inevitable disappointments.  And understanding how to cope in a healthy way is an invaluable skill. How you cope can easily be the difference between living a good life and living a sick one.  If you choose unhealthy coping mechanisms like avoidance or denial, for example, you can quickly turn a tough situation into a tragic one.  And sadly, this is a common mistake many people make. When you find yourself facing a disheartening reality, your first reaction might be to deny the situation, or to avoid dealing with it altogether.  But by doing so you’re inadvertently holding on even tighter to the pain that you wish to let go of – you’re, in effect, sealing it up inside you. Let’s imagine someone close to you has grown ill, and supporting this person through his or her illness is incredibly painful.  You might not want to deal with the pain, so you cope by avoiding it, by finding ways to numb yourself with alcohol and unhealthy eating.  And consequently, you grow physically ill too while the pain continues to fester inside you. Obviously, that’s not good. If you notice yourself doing something similar, it’s time to pause, admit to yourself that you’re coping by avoiding, and then shift your focus to a healthier coping mechanism, like using the mantras in this post to help you open your mind. When you face struggles with an attitude of openness – open to the painful feelings and emotions you have – you find out that it’s not comfortable, but you can still be fine and you can still step forward.  Openness means you don’t instantly decide that you know this is only a horrible experience – it means you decide that you don’t really know what the next step will be like, and you’d like to understand the whole truth of the matter.  It’s a learning stance, instead of one that assumes the worst. Coping certainly isn’t an easy practice, and I’m not suggesting that it is.  What I am suggesting is that it’s worth your while.  With practice, healthy coping allows you to find better ways of managing life’s continuous stream of unexpected and uncontrollable circumstances.  For example… And of course, we’ve merely just scratched the surface of an endless pool of possibilities for healthy coping.  The key thing to understand is that by learning to cope in healthier ways, you will find that you can better handle anything life throws your way, and come out stronger, and oftentimes even happier, than you were before. In the end, the world is as you are inside.  What you think, you see, and you ultimately become.  So gather and choose your thoughts wisely… Think how you want to live today. How has adjusting your attitude affected your life and circumstances? What else do you try to keep in mind to strengthen your mindset and cope more effectively with stress or pain?

This morning I saw a middle-aged woman ferociously slam the car door in her husband’s face and storm off into a department store.  Then, an hour later, I couldn’t help but notice two 20-something friends sitting next to me at a local coffee shop, the man staring down at his iPhone the entire time his friend shared with him her concerns about her sister’s drug addiction.  And just now I came across someone’s rant on Facebook about their significant other that concluded with, “ALL MEN are exactly the same!” Most of us have likely done something similar in our relationships at some point, because relationships aren’t easy, and sometimes we make missteps.  In fact, let’s be honest – we’ve all acted in toxic, damaging ways at one time or another.  None of us are immune to occasional toxic mood swings.  But that doesn’t excuse what we do to each other. With practice, we CAN do better. Over the years, through our coaching practice, Getting Back to Happy course, and live events, Marc and I have worked with thousands of individuals and couples looking to fix their failing relationships, and we’ve learned a lot about what it takes to make this happen.  One of the most significant realizations is the fact that most failing and failed relationships (both intimate and platonic) suffer from the same basic behavioral issues.  I’m sharing them with you today in hopes that doing so will help you catch yourself in the act, so you can course-correct when necessary. Believe it or not, roughly 90% of the failing relationships we’ve witnessed over the years suffered from one or more of the following: Complaints are OK.  Disagreements are OK too.  These are natural, honest reactions to a person’s decisions or behavior.  But when complaints and disagreements spiral out of control into global attacks on the person, and not on their decisions or behavior, this spells trouble.  For example: “They didn’t call me when they said they would because they were busy and forgot, but because they are a horrible, wretched, evil person.” Remember, there’s a big difference between who someone IS and what they sometimes DO. Frequent name-calling, threats, eye-rolling, belittling, mockery, hostile teasing, etc.  In whatever form, gestures like these are poisonous to a relationship because they convey hate.  And it’s virtually impossible to resolve a relationship problem when the other person is constantly receiving the message that you hate them. Also, keep in mind that if someone you love makes a mistake and you choose to forgive them, your actions must reinforce your words.  In other words, let bygones be bygones.  Don’t use their past wrongdoings to justify your present righteousness.  When you constantly use someone’s past wrongdoings to make yourself seem “better” than them (“I’m better than you because, unlike you, I didn’t do XYZ in the past.”), it’s a lose-lose situation. Replace your negative thoughts with positive communication!  Because the truth is, if you’re throwing hateful gestures at a person instead of communicating with them, there’s a good chance they don’t even know why you’re being so mean. When communication between two people isn’t open and honest, there’s a lot of important stuff that never gets said. When you deny responsibility in every relationship dispute, all you’re really doing is blaming the other person.  You’re saying, in effect, “The problem here is never me, and it’s always you.”  This denial of accountability just escalates every argument, because there’s a complete and utter breakdown of communication. The key thing to understand is that you have a choice.  Either you’re choosing to be in a relationship with another person, or you aren’t.  If you’re choosing to be in, then you are responsible for it.  Denying this means you’re giving up all your power to the other person – you’re their victim, regardless of circumstances (positive or negative), because you’ve given them 100% of the responsibility for the relationship you have with them. So remember, even when the behavior driving a relationship dispute belongs to the other person, the only way to find common ground, or simply create more healthy space for yourself, is to first own the fact that you are 50% responsible the relationship at all times.  Once you do, you have the power to make progress one way or the other. Tuning out, ignoring, disengaging, refusing to acknowledge, etc.  All variations of the silent treatment don’t just remove the other person from the argument you’re having with them, it ends up removing them, emotionally, from the relationship you have with them. When you’re ignoring someone, you’re really teaching them to live without you.  If that’s what you want, be clear about it.  And if not, drop it!  Although not quite as prevalent as the four mentioned above, these behavioral issues are still incredibly common relationship-killers: Emotional blackmail happens when you apply an emotional penalty against someone if they don’t do exactly what you want them to do.  The key condition here is that they change they’re behavior, against their will, as a result of the emotional blackmail.  In other words, absent the emotional blackmail they would live differently, but they fear the penalty – or punishment – and so they give in.  This is an extremely unhealthy relationship behavior. The solution, again, relies heavily on better communication.  There should NOT be a penalty, just an honest conversation.  If two people care about each other and want to maintain a healthy relationship, they absolutely need to be “allowed” to openly communicate ALL of their feelings to each other – their true feelings – not just the agreeable and positive ones.  If this is not “allowed” or supported by one or both people involved in the relationship – if one or both people fear punishment for their honesty – lies and deceit will gradually replace love and trust, which ultimately leads to a complete emotional disconnection.  (Read Emotional Blackmail.) Trust is the bedrock of a healthy relationship, and when trust is broken it takes a long time and commitment on the part of both parties involved to repair it and heal.  The key thing to remember here is that secrets can be just as deceitful as openly telling a lie. All too often, I’ll hear a coaching/course student say something like, “I didn’t tell him but I didn’t lie about it, either.”  This statement is a contradiction, as omissions are lies.  If you’re covering up your tracks or withholding the truth in any way, it’s only a matter of time before the truth comes out and trust in the relationship completely breaks down.  So speak the truth, always. Being honest is the only way to be at peace with yourself and those you care about. Failing to carve out quality time for your important relationships is one of the most unhealthy relationship mistakes of them all, and yet it often flies under the radar… at least for a while… until everything begins to fall apart. The truth is relationships are like every other living entity in the sense that they require nurturing in order to survive and thrive.  It’s easy to allow the rush of our busy lives to take over, especially when we have young children, work, hobbies, friends, and a body that demands nourishing food and regular exercise.  But your relationship with someone is a body as well, and if it’s not nourished with quality time every week, it will start to wither. Dedicate ample time every week to focus exclusively on those you care about.  Nothing you can give is more appreciated than your sincere, focused attention – your full presence.  Being with someone, listening without a ticking clock and without anticipation of the next scheduled event is the ultimate compliment. When your marriage, friendship, parenting, etc. gets difficult, it’s not an immediate sign that you’re doing it wrong.  These intimate, intricate relationships are toughest when you’re doing them right – when you’re dedicating time, having the tough conversations, and making daily sacrifices. Healthy, long-tern relationships are amazing, but rarely easy 24/7.  Resisting the hard times and seeing them as immediate evidence that something is wrong or that you’re with the wrong person only exacerbates the difficulties.  By contrast, finding the patience and mindfulness to view the challenges as an opportunity to work together will give your relationship the energy and strength needed to transcend the problems and grow even stronger in the long run. It’s easy to believe that it’s your partner’s or best friend’s job to make you feel happy and whole.  But the truth is, while a healthy relationship can bring tremendous delight to your life, it’s not their responsibility to fill in your empty voids.  That’s your responsibility and yours alone, and until you accept this responsibility (for your unhappiness, frustration, boredom, etc.), problems will inevitably continue in your relationship. Another way of looking at this is to realize that healthy relationships contain two people who practice self-care as individuals.  When two people meet, the biggest prize always goes to the one with the most self-acceptance.  He or she will be calmer, more confident, and more at ease with the other person.  Truth be told, what you see in the mirror is often what you see in your relationships.  Your petty disappointments in your partner and friends often reflect your petty disappointments in yourself.  Your acceptance of your partner or friends often reflects your acceptance of yourself.  Thus, the first step to having a truly healthy, long-term relationship with someone else is to have a healthy relationship with yourself. If you can relate to any of these toxic behaviors, remember, you are not alone.  We all have unhealthy personalities buried deep within us that have the potential to occasionally sneak up on us and those closest to us.  As mentioned above, the key is awareness – recognizing these toxic behaviors and then course-correcting when necessary. So, which of these toxic behaviors have you struggled with?  Which ones have interfered with your relationships?  How do you cope?  Leave a comment below and share your insights with us.

"7 Things You Have to Stop Believing to Live a Successful Life On Your Own Terms|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-life-on-your-own-terms.jpg?resize=500%2C337&ssl=1| Since the mind drives the body, it’s the way we think that ultimately makes the dreams we dream possible or impossible.  Our reality is almost entirely a reflection of our thoughts and the way we routinely behave based on what we believe to be true. The problem is, what we believe to be true, isn’t always the truth. And unrealized dreams – and regrets – are gradually born in our lives when our misguided beliefs stop us from being our best. This phenomenon occurs in our lives more frequently than most of us realize. Our course students come to us almost every day with questions and concerns about ongoing problems and regrets they have that are fueled primarily by their own misperceptions of reality.  And while their personal circumstances tend to vary, the core beliefs leading them astray almost always overlap. The truth is, no matter how smart or educated you are, your subconscious mind will sometimes attach itself to beliefs that habitually push you farther and farther away from where you want to be in life.  Or as one of our course students put it on a coaching call this morning: “My mind seems to be jam-packed with all these beliefs that just lead me in the opposite direction of my dreams, which is living a successful life on my own terms.” So, in light of our student’s realization, and our collective human struggle to think better and live better, here are some super common faulty beliefs you need to let go of if you want to live a successful (and happier) life on your own terms… When I was growing up there was a silent yet unanimously agreed upon definition of what success looked like in my family.  Although it was never openly discussed, it was implied through various conversations and decisions I was directly or indirectly included in. All of my immediate and extended family members were in one of two groups: The commonality being a steady paycheck from a large corporation. That was the implicitly agreed upon definition of success in my family. And by this definition, I was a failure, and still am. I earned a college degree, but I opted to hop between several small startup companies out of college instead.  My paychecks were low and the stability of my work was inconsistent at best (but I was learning).  Then, a few years down the road, amidst a landslide of personal tragedies, I quit my day job to focus full-time on a side project called Marc and Angel Hack Life (you may have heard of it) that Angel and I had been gradually developing and supporting on nights and weekends. Needless to say, my family was very skeptical of my evolving career path and decisions. At some point, however, I realized I had to give up my family’s definition of success. And I had to give up everyone else’s definition of success too. Of course, doing so was easier said than done.  The definitions of success that I had grown up around, and the beliefs they carried, were so deeply embedded in the cultural narratives I was accustomed to that they had very much become a benchmark by which I subconsciously measured my life.  So it took me awhile to get my head straight about what success meant to me.  And to a certain extent, I’m sure you can relate.  Because no one is immune to this phenomena.  Even the most seasoned entrepreneurs and creative types I know, who basically live on their own terms in every imaginable way, still get caught up in the overplayed idea of fame and fortune being symbols of success. The bottom line is that, although challenging, giving up other people’s definition of success is incredibly liberating and ultimately leads to the fullest expression of who you are. Just think about it… Other people aren’t going to live with the results of your choices.  So why would you live according to their contrived definition of success? Have you ever honestly asked yourself what success means to YOU? Or have you simply adopted your definition and beliefs from everyone around you? For far too many us, the answer is the latter. A coaching client recently told Angel and me that she wanted to become a millionaire to satisfy certain milestones for success that she had set for herself.  But as we dug deeper into her story and her reasoning, it became evident that a number of her reasons for wanting to be a millionaire didn’t require a million dollars to achieve.  She had just been conditioned to believe they did.  And she literally laughed out loud when she realized this. By understanding the essence of your goals and how YOU define success, it’s easier to give up other people’s contrived definitions and beliefs. And remember, the point is not that one measure of success is any better or worse than another.  The point is that you get to choose how you define it for yourself. Simply recognize that the more conscious and deliberate you can be about what success means for YOU, the more empowered you will be to pursue the path that’s true for you. Most people misinterpret how confidence works.  They think confidence is something they have to possess before they can perform at their best.  So they make a (subconscious) decision to wait until they feel more confident before taking the next step.  But waiting around isn’t a confidence-building activity, so they never feel more confident, and they never take action. Let this be your wake-up call… Confidence is not a prerequisite to present and future performance.  Rather, confidence is a direct bi-product of past performance. For example, if you start your day on the right foot, you’re likely to have improved confidence throughout the rest of your day.  Conversely, if you start your day poorly and fall flat on your face, that prior performance will likely lower your confidence for a little while (until your confidence level inevitably cycles again). But the real kicker is the fact that today is tomorrow’s past.  Your confidence going into tomorrow is directly dependent on you taking positive action today and learning from it.  And this means two things… So whenever you catch yourself waiting around for more confidence to magically arrive before you start working on the task in front of you, remind yourself of how confidence works, and then force yourself to start before you feel ready. Back in 2006 Angel and I started the blog that would ultimately become Marc and Angel Hack Life.  We didn’t know how to design a website.  We didn’t know what a blog was.  We didn’t even really know how to write very well.  All we knew were five things: How did we learn to start a website and build a blog?  How did we find the confidence necessary to do so?  Same way anyone else does it.  Bit by bit, step by step, one page at a time. You start reading and learning.  You make decisions and take action.  You make mistakes.  You learn some more.  You try again.  You get a little better.  You get a little more confident.  You learn some more.  You make more decisions and take more action… And before we knew it, we were blogging daily on Marc and Angel Hack Life. This process is at the core of all effective confidence-building and goal-achieving initiatives, and it’s one of the most essential skills you need to develop to succeed in life.  It doesn’t matter if you want to be a blogger, an entrepreneur, an artist, or the CEO of a Fortune 500 company.  Learn to start before you feel ready, and you will learn how to succeed, step by step, before you even realize that you’re good enough. Today is the day! It’s time to set your plans into motion and make a daily ritual of generating small wins for yourself.  Do so, and I guarantee that your small wins will add up quickly, and you’ll grow more confident and closer to what you ultimately want to achieve with each passing day. Just as you don’t need more confidence to take the next smallest step forward, you don’t likely need more planning and overthinking either. Stephen King once said, “Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work.”  I have that quote taped above my work desk.  It reminds me that while proper planning, strategizing and masterminding is important as you move through a project, it’s also extremely easy to lose yourself indefinitely in doing so. When our great ideas are still just concepts floating around in our minds, we tend to think really BIG.  And while thinking big isn’t inherently bad, the downside is that it often makes the barrier for taking action quite high.  In other words, we tend to overthink our projects to the point where they seem more complicated than they actually are, and so we stall again and again to give ourselves more time to prepare for the next step. To avoid “big thinking paralysis,” pare your ideas down into smaller, immediately testable activities.  Can you trial-run the idea of a larger scale conference by hosting a series of smaller local events (just like Angel and I did to prepare for Think Better, Live Better)?  Can you take an idea for a book and test it by writing several related blog posts (just like Angel and I did with 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently)?  Can you draw it before you build it?  Can you prototype it?  Once you’ve tested your idea on a smaller scale, you’ll have the insight and data you need to take your idea and project to the next level. The concept of taking action, just one step at a time, might seem ridiculously obvious, but at some point we all get caught up in the moment and find ourselves over-planning and overthinking things.  Our minds are working hard but nothing is getting done.  Angel and I have seen this transpire hundreds of times over the years – a coaching client/course student wants to achieve a big goal, and can’t choose just one or two important steps to focus on, so nothing worthwhile ever gets done.  Let this be a reminder to you.  Remind yourself that you can’t lift a thousand pounds all at once, yet you can easily lift one pound a thousand times.  Small, repeated, incremental efforts will get you there.  It doesn’t happen in an instant, but it does happen a lot faster than not getting there at all.  More on this below… Angel and I have mentioned this numerous times in the past, but it’s so darn important that it can’t possibly be overstated… Goals don’t make positive changes happen, daily rituals do. Seriously, meditate on that for a moment. Because too often we obsess ourselves with a big goal – a big end result – but are completely unfocused when it comes to the ritual – the recurring steps – that ultimately make the goal happen.  And so the weight of this big, unrealized goal sits heavy on our mind and brings our progress down to a crawl. Does that sound at all familiar? If so, it’s time to shift your focus AWAY from your goals.  Think about this… If you completely ignored one of your goals for the next few weeks and instead focused solely on the daily rituals that reinforce this goal, would you still get positive results? For example, if you were trying to lose weight and you ignored your goal to lose 25 pounds, and instead focused only on eating healthy and exercising each day, would you still get results? YES, you would!  Gradually, you would get closer and closer to your goal without even thinking about it. Watch this quick video Angel and I recorded for you – let’s take a closer look at the power of daily rituals…  (Note: Angel and I build small, daily, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.) To be successful on your own terms, you have to not mind being wrong in the short term.  You have to take a stand, test your theory, and then admit it if you realize that your theory was wrong.  It’s a process of trial and error that helps you discover what is right.  And finding out what is right is a lot more important than always being right. The process of trial and error is an essential part of any effective person’s life.  Truth be told, when any human being executes a new idea for the first time, the outcome is rarely glamorous.  The important thing is to synthesize the lessons learned during the process to refine the initial idea, and create a new-and-improved strategy, and perhaps a new and improved daily ritual that supports it. The bottom line here is that expecting to get it right the first time is an exercise in futility.  Prototyping, testing and iteration is vital to transforming a decent idea into an outcome of value.  Rather than being discouraged by your “failures,” watch closely and learn from them.  Then use what you’ve learned to build something slightly better.  And then do it again and again – small steps.  Sooner or later, you’ll find the level of success you had envisioned. Besides the intelligent art of getting the right things done, there is the often-forgotten art of leaving the wrong things undone. You must practice saying “no” even if it feels foreign to you.  Your time and energy is not infinite – in fact, it’s incredibly limited.  Seasoned achievers who live on their own terms know they must guard their time and energy (and their focus) closely. Not to toot our own horns, but Angel and I have done pretty well for ourselves over the past decade.  Our writing and coaching business has flourished beyond our wildest dreams.  We’ve sold almost 40,000 copies of our first book, we have hundreds of students actively enrolled in our Getting Back to Happy course, and we’ve sold out and delivered very successful (lots of positive feedback) personal-growth conferences (Think Better Live Better).  Our expertise and insights are in demand.  However, even though we could easily scale up our business offerings to the next level, doing so wouldn’t leave enough time and energy to focus on the personal (family) objectives that are even higher on our priority list, and it also wouldn’t leave us enough time and energy to make substantial, intimate connections with our current students and readers. Always keep in mind that you don’t have to accept every great opportunity you’re invited to.  When you’re in execution mode, remember that new and unexpected opportunities can also mean distraction from your core objectives and priorities.  Saying “no” is an essential part of living effectively on your own terms. No matter how much determination and willpower you have, if you keep yourself positioned in an environment that works against your best intentions, you will eventually succumb to that environment. This is where so many of us make life-altering missteps.  When we find ourselves struggling to make progress in an unhealthy environment, we somehow believe that we have no other choice – that positioning ourselves in a more supportive environment, even for short intervals, is impossible. So, rather than working in a supportive environment that pushes us forward, we expend all our energy trying to pull the baggage of an unhealthy environment along with us.  And eventually, despite our best efforts, we run out of energy. The key thing to remember here is that, as a human being, your environment immensely affects you.  And, consequently, one of the best uses of your energy is to consciously choose and design working environments for yourself that support and facilitate the outcomes you intend to achieve. For example, if you’re trying to reduce your alcohol consumption, you must… Because if you don’t your willpower will eventually collapse… “One more drink won’t hurt, right?” Wrong! You need to set clear boundaries, commit, and then reconfigure your environment to make the achievement of your commitment possible. Let’s think about some other examples… The bottom line is that determination and willpower alone will only get you so far.  If you want to make a substantial, positive, long-term change in your life, you also have to gradually change your environment accordingly.  This is truly the foundation of how we grow and evolve as human beings.  We mold and adapt to our environments.  Thus, conscious growth and evolution involves decisively choosing or creating enriching environments that force you to progressively mold and adapt into the human being you want to become.

You want to build that side business you’ve been daydreaming about, but the complexities of actually starting it make the palms of your hands sweaty. Speaking up and adding value in corporate meetings could improve your reputation in the eyes of your boss, but you’re scared of saying the wrong thing. Circumstances like these – the ones that are fundamentally important in the long-term, but downright terrifying in the near-term – are incredibly common. And of course, the easiest reaction to these circumstances is avoidance. But that would be a huge mistake! In fact, if there’s one thing I’ve learned from completing over 850 self-assigned comfort zone challenges, it’s this: We don’t stumble accidentally into a wildly fulfilling, deeply satisfying, jaw-dropping life… we create it.  And the journey always leads us outside our comfort zone. Before starting The Year of Fear Project, I was the least likely person on planet Earth to be interesting, adventurous, or successful (more on my story here). Even after a decade spent studying the psychology of success and how to procrastination-proof my goals, I found tackling something outside of my comfort zone every day was the one decision that transformed every area of my life nearly overnight. I have now gone on to speak, write, and teach students across seven continents how to get comfortable with the circumstances that make them uncomfortable. Here’s the good news: you don’t have to invest all the hard work and hustle I did over the past several years to learn a few of the most powerful lessons from venturing outside your comfort zone. Here’s the bad news: you can’t “unlearn” what you’re about to read… After getting a sneak peek into just a few (of the many) life changing lessons I’ve learned, you may have no choice but to join me on this journey. When you discover the real “secret” to getting everything you want out of life starts with one simple action – facing your fears in small ways every day – it becomes the healthiest addiction one can form. A comfort zone is like wallpaper in most people’s lives – operating in the background, ever-present, something we never even think about. But as much as we seemingly enjoy comfort and routine, we as human beings are often happiest when challenged and making progress. And when we commit to finding small ways to grow daily, we discover four things rather quickly: Before you practice expanding your comfort zone, you may think fear is a sign that you are on the wrong track. I vividly remember preparing for my first cross-country move to Los Angeles from the Midwest. Even though I dreamt about it daily, I struggled to slash it off my bucket list for four years. Every time I convinced myself to finally put my sleepy hometown in the rearview mirror, fear would overwhelm me… What I discovered after starting The Year of Fear Project is perfectly summed up by one of my favorite writers, Jon Acuff:  “We will never be brave enough to do what we need to do next.” The problem wasn’t that I was losing sleep at night and sweating through my sheets at the rate of Niagara Falls. The problem was I thought I shouldn’t be. Even when you are on the right track, you will still be afraid and doubt yourself. Half the battle is already won when you expect that fear will show up. It does not matter the size of the leap – little or large. From walking up to compliment a beautiful stranger, to bravely asking your boss for a raise, doubt and fear are always near when you are on the right track.  I’ll say that again… Doubt and fear are always near, especially when you are on the right track. And it takes practice to embrace this reality… Instead of a stoplight, I now see doubt and fear as a spotlight – illuminating where I should go next. I realize all of the good decisions (and necessary growth decisions) that change our lives often cause us to lose a little sleep, and that’s perfectly OK. How would your life change if you saw doubt and fear as a sign that you are on the right track? What goal or project would you bravely stick with or start up again? I’ll kick this off with a disclaimer:  having a few people you can lean on and trust to give it to you straight when you are being a wackadoodle is important. However, what may surprise you is that those whose advice helps you the least can sometimes be those who love you the most. So, trust me now and believe me later:  you can love someone without listening to them every step of the way. When you start taking risks – especially the kind of risks your loved ones don’t agree with – you become a red hot bullseye for feedback. Even when they mean well, it’s rare that they’ll just toss their hats in the air and enthusiastically shout: “Go for it!” “Do what makes you happy!” “Quit that crappy sales job that is slowly suffocating your soul and go teach yoga!” Why? In short:  they care and want to protect you from failure. But they may also subconsciously fear that if your life changes too much, there may not be space left for them. And that’s OK too. That’s just one of approximately a million oddball ways we humans show love. A powerful quote that helped me release my people pleasing ways in this area came from my friend, Jesse Elder: “The greatest gift we can give ourselves is to own our own happiness. The greatest freedom we can give to others is to let them have their own experience and not try to control it.” If that’s not worthy of being tattooed on the backside of our eyelids, I don’t know what is. And Jesse’s sentiment is also reinforced by another one of my favorite quotes… “If you have big goals and dreams, don’t expect others to follow you, because you’ll represent the strength, courage and vision they don’t have yet.” – Peter Voogd Bottom line: If you want to slide into the grave with less regret and make a positive impact on the world in the way only you can, I would encourage you to take calculated risks and let other people’s doubts and opinions about how you live your life be their problem, not yours. Sometimes the greatest gift we can give others is to simply remind them of what is possible when they take a chance on themselves. How can you take responsibility for your own happiness and allow others to have their own experience? When you start facing your fears, expect that people may call you “crazy” long before they call you “cool.” These days it’s “cool” that I run two successful online businesses from my Macbook Pro. It’s admirable I’m invited to speak on stage and get interviewed on podcasts across the globe. But you know what wasn’t cool? This little whacky idea I had in 2013 to do something new, different, or outside my comfort zone every day for an entire year straight. And it wasn’t just friends and family who looked at me like I had lost my mind – strangers wagged their fingers of disapproval at me too. When I decided to do a police ride-along to collect a new experience, the dispatcher who scheduled my ride was puzzled by my idea of “fun.” Especially when it involved a bulletproof vest and waking up at 4:30 AM on a Saturday.  Result:  it was a life-changing Saturday I will never forget. When I walked into a nursing home and asked them to nominate me their loneliest visitor because it was a good deed that had been collecting dust on my bucket list for half a decade, the staff crossed their fingers hoping I wasn’t a lunatic.  Result:  one of the most powerful experiences of my twenties. The story has now gone on to inspire others across the globe to complete the same comfort zone challenge. When I booked a one-way plane ticket to the Pacific Northwest to live in a city I had never been to simply because it “sounded like a great adventure,” my Grandmother didn’t sleep a wink for weeks.  Result:  I had the best summer of my life. When I had zilch speaking experience and agreed to do a 45-minute talk at Marc and Angel’s Think Better, Live Better conference, flanked by some of the best speakers money can hire, other speakers I knew thought I was bonkers.  Result:  I worked my tail off for months, lost a lot of sleep, and walked on stage so terrified I was afraid the film crew would catch it on camera. However, when I got a standing ovation and walked off stage to see Marc and Angel smiling, I’ve never been so proud to make two great friends happy that they chose me. Stepping outside your comfort zone doesn’t have to be a large challenge to be life-changing either. Some of the most powerful challenges I took on were small, but significant... Look closely at the journey of anyone you admire. I guarantee that most of the small things that led them to being called “cool” first earned them the label of “crazy.” And that’s great news for you and me. We now get to be cool with being called crazy, and know it is simply part of the process when we’re trying to put a positive dent in this giant spinning rock. Nobody who changed history followed all the rules. What crazy ideas do you have that the world needs to experience? When you decide to start taking risks it doesn’t mean you can’t care about what other people think. Or that you get to ditch priorities like rent, kids, and student loans. However, we often fool ourselves into thinking life has to be an either / or choice. I have to be a Mom OR I can chase my dream of opening a craft shop. I would encourage you to make one tiny but powerful adjustment to your vocabulary: Swap OR for AND. I am a Mom AND I’m building my craft business on nights and weekends after my kiddos fall asleep. I was born with a disability AND I can still travel the world. I am a software engineer AND I am completing a world record for playing a golf course in all 50 states. Most great ideas, inventions and businesses are built off the midnight oil in the scraps of time others discard to social media, reality TV, or mindless activities. Ever heard of Facebook? Or Snapchat? But, it is going to take bravery. Pushing through the doubt that is built into all great ideas. Proclaiming your dreams. Loving others without listening to them 24/7. Being cool with being called crazy before your idea blossoms. And knowing, deep down, that what you want for yourself matters as much as other priorities in your life. The biggest mistake I see most people make with trying to expand their comfort zone is believing it has to be “big” or reckless. After 850 comfort zone challenges, I firmly advise the opposite. Start small. Simply doing something outside of your ordinary routine is enough to stretch you and wake your brain up. Consider taking a new way home from work. Dig out a piece of clothing you bravely purchased but have not worn yet. Walk up to the next interesting person you see and say, “Of all the creative and interesting people I’ve seen today, you’re my favorite!” Don’t underestimate the power of tiny opportunities to stretch your comfort zone. These small actions help you meet new people and build your confidence to try bigger comfort zone challenges over time. Another common misnomer is the belief that age is a factor. Age is irrelevant to when you can begin adventurously living outside your comfort zone. If you’re older, shouldn’t you be inspired to take risks that make the most of the time you have left? If you’re younger, don’t you want to make the next 50 years the best yet? Again, it does not matter when you start, just that you START! Every morning when you wake up you are given an invitation to live a life of complete engagement and rich adventure. Don’t turn it down!

One Life-Changing Question You Keep Forgetting to Ask Yourself|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/one-life-changing-question.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| As Angel and I watched a rerun of the Academy Awards last night, we both noticed an obvious commonality between many of the speeches the winners on stage made when they accepted their awards.  If you stripped the details out of each speech, 90% of them boiled down to: “I am so thankful.  My whole life has been leading up to this moment.” The most interesting thing about this sentiment, in my opinion, is that regardless of a human being’s social status, wealth, age, or unique situation, their whole life has undoubtedly been leading up to every present moment of their life.  Think about that for a second.  This reality might seem more significant on stage at a high-stakes awards ceremony, but it’s equally significant to all of us.  Every single thing you’ve gone through in life – every high, every low, and everything in between – has all led you to the moment you’re experiencing right now. This means that you are exactly where you need to be to get to where you want to go.  It’s just a matter of taking one new step in the right direction, and another, and another. So, never assume that you’re stuck with the way things are right now.  You aren’t. Things can change if you want them to, at any age.  Life changes every single moment, and so can YOU! The key is to embrace these powerful realities and not procrastinate… Think about a change you want to make in your life, or a goal you want to achieve. Then watch this quick video Angel and I recorded for you, and let us ask a simple yet powerful question that just might change your perspective about everything…  Now that you’ve watched the video, and have been slapped with a little healthy perspective, it’s time to revisit that important change or goal of yours, and then face the truth… How old will you be in 10 years if you don’t do it? Exactly 10 years older than you are today – the same exact age you’ll be in 10 years if you actually follow through and DO IT! But instead of feeling proud of the lessons you’ve learned and the progress you’ve made, you’ll feel an inevitable sense of regret that comes from never even trying. Time will have passed with nothing new to show for it. You will have grown older, without getting any closer to what you ultimately want. Let that sink in for a moment. If you’ve been frustrated by the same mediocre results for too long, yet nothing is changing in your life, it’s probably not that you haven’t been given enough answers, but that you’ve been asking yourself the wrong questions. Remember, it takes a great deal of courage and grit to admit that something needs to change, and a lot more courage and grit still, to accept responsibility for making this change happen.  Yes, growth and change may be hard sometimes, but nothing in life is as hard as staying stuck where you don’t belong. All details aside, when it comes to making a meaningful change in your life – earning a new degree, building a new business, fostering a new relationship, starting a family, becoming more mindful, or any other personal journey that takes time and commitment – you have to start asking yourself the right questions, and then you have to build daily rituals into your life that reinforce your realizations. So… What do you want to change or achieve in your life? How old will you be in 10 years if you don’t do it (and never even try)? And, perhaps most importantly… Are you willing to spend a little time every day like many people won’t, so you can spend the rest of your life like many people can’t? Once you have your mind wrapped around the first two questions, and you’ve decided to say “YES” to the third question, it’s time to start building positive daily rituals into your life so you can finally make real progress. Because goals don’t make positive changes happen, daily rituals do. Watch this quick video Angel and I recorded for you, and let us explain…  (Note: Angel and I build small, daily, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.)

She nodded her head slowly in agreement, “Yeah, I guess that’s true.  I’ve been sitting in my comfort zone for awhile now, in my own little bubble of half-truths, mostly miserable.” Then we sat for a prolonged moment in silence together, before she took a deep breath and said, “Thank you, I needed to hear that.” And I thanked her too, for reminding me that the truth does not cease to exist when it is ignored – it just tends to fester and haunt us… That’s the general gist of a conversation I had this morning with a new Getting Back to Happy course student.  I’m sharing this with you today (with permission, of course) in hopes that it might remind you of the truths you’ve been subconsciously avoiding. Although it may be tough to stretch our comfort zones beyond the boundaries of what we’re familiar with – and into the realities of what we don’t yet feel ready to deal with – doing so is often the only clear path to mental and emotional freedom. And we have to admit that, to a certain extent, we’ve been embracing too many half-truths and falsehoods in our lives.  These half-truths and falsehoods are subtle, but they constantly get in our way – they stop us from growing, learning, loving, and living to our greatest potential. Admitting this can be downright uncomfortable, scary, and even a bit painful sometimes, but doing so is absolutely necessary. So in light of this, I want to highlight seven incredibly beneficial, life-changing truths Angel and I have seen hundreds of our course students and coaching clients struggle to admit and deal with over the past decade for various fear-based reasons. We all struggle.  We all suffer on the inside.  Every day… We worry.We procrastinate.We feel overwhelmed.We feel angry.We feel lonely.We don’t feel good enough.We wish we were thinnerWe wish we had more money.We wish our jobs were different. We wish our relationships were different.We think everything in life should be easier. And yet, every one of these struggles is self-created.  They are real, but they are only real because we have created them in our minds.  We have attached ourselves to certain ideals and fantasies about how life has to be in order to be good enough for us. We worry because things might not turn out how we expect.  We procrastinate because we fear discomfort and failure.  We feel overwhelmed because we think we should be further along than we are.  We feel angry because life should not be this way.  And so it goes. But it’s all in our heads. And it doesn’t have to be this way.  At least not anymore. You can think better… you can live better.  This is a choice YOU can make. Take a deep breath, and let all that thinking and ruminating go.  Just bring your attention to the present moment.  Focus on what’s here with you now – the light, the sounds, your body, the ground under your feet, the objects and people moving and resting around you.  Don’t judge these things against what they should be – just accept what they actually are.  Because once you accept reality, only then can you gradually improve it. See life as it is, without all the ideals and fantasies you’ve been preoccupied with.  Let go of all of those stressful distractions, and just experience this moment. This moment is good enough as it is.  Focus.  Be in it completely. You can go back to fretting about everything else in a minute. “What’s wrong with wanting other people to like you?” That’s a question several of our course students recently asked me in response to one of my course-related emails.  And I’ve been asked similar questions over the years too.  So let’s talk about it… In a nutshell, tying your self-worth to everyone else’s opinions gives you a flawed sense of reality that can cause serious trouble when it comes to your confidence and happiness.  Yet, as human beings, we do it quite often.  From wanting others to think we’re attractive, to checking the number of likes and comments on our social media posts, most of us care about what others think.  In fact, a big part of this is an innate desire we are born with.  It has been proven time and time again that babies’ emotions are often drawn directly from the behaviors of those around them. As we grow up, we learn to separate our thoughts and emotions from everyone else’s, but many of us continue to seek – and in many cases beg for – positive social validation from others.  In a recent survey we did with 1,200 of our course students and coaching clients, 67% of them admitted that their self-worth is strongly tied to what other people think of them.  And even though that isn’t a healthy way to measure your self-worth, it isn’t surprising that so many of us think this way. We naturally respond to everything we experience through the lens of our learned expectations – a set of deep-rooted beliefs about the way the world is and how things should be.  And one of the most prevailing expectations we have involves external validation and how others ‘should’ respond to us. Over a century ago, social psychologist Charles Cooley identified the phenomenon of the “looking-glass self,” which is when we believe “I am not what I think I am, and I am not what you think I am – I am what I think that you think I am.”  Sadly, this kind of external validation has insecurity at its core, and relying on it for even a short time chips away at our sense of self-worth and self-confidence. The biggest problem is we tend to forget that people judge us based on a pool of influences in their own life that have absolutely nothing to do with us.  For example, a person might assume things about you based on a troubled past experience they had with someone else who looks like you, or someone else who shares your same last name, etc.  Therefore, basing your self-worth on what others think puts you in a perpetual state of vulnerability – you are literally at the mercy of their unreliable, bias perspectives.  If they see you in the right light, and respond to you in a positive, affirming manner, then you feel good about yourself.  And if not, you feel like you did something wrong. Bottom line:  When you’re doing everything for other people, and basing your happiness and self-worth on their opinions, you’ve lost your moral center.  If you catch yourself doing this – as you inevitably will at some point – remind yourself of the truth:  What most people think of you doesn’t matter at all. All too often we let the rejections of our past dictate every move we make.  We literally do not know ourselves to be any better than what some opinionated person or narrow circumstance once told us was true.  Of course, an old rejection doesn’t mean we aren’t good enough; it just means some person or circumstance from our past failed to align with what we had to offer at the time.  But somehow we don’t see it that way – we hit a mental barricade that stops us in our tracks. This is one of the most common and damaging thought patterns we as human beings succumb to. Even though we intellectually know that we’re gradually growing stronger than we were in the past, our subconscious mind often forgets that our capabilities have grown. Let me give you a quick metaphorical example… Zookeepers typically strap a thin metal chain to a grown elephant’s leg and then attach the other end to a small wooden peg that’s hammered into the ground.  The 10-foot tall, 10,000-pound elephant could easily snap the chain, uproot the wooden peg and escape to freedom with minimal effort.  But it doesn’t.  In fact the elephant never even tries.  The world’s most powerful land animal, which can uproot a big tree as easily as you could break a toothpick, remains defeated by a small wooden peg and a flimsy chain. Why? Because when the elephant was a baby, its trainers used the exact same methods to domesticate it.  A thin chain was strapped around its leg and the other end of the chain was tied to a wooden peg in the ground.  At the time, the chain and peg were strong enough to restrain the baby elephant.  When it tried to break away, the metal chain would pull it back.  Sometimes, tempted by the world it could see in the distance, the elephant would pull harder.  But the chain would not budge, and soon the baby elephant realized trying to escape was not possible.  So it stopped trying. And now that the elephant is all grown up, it sees the chain and the peg and it remembers what it learned as a baby – the chain and peg are impossible to escape.  Of course this is no longer true, but it doesn’t matter.  It doesn’t matter that the 200-pound baby is now a 10,000-pound powerhouse.  The elephant’s self-limiting thoughts and beliefs prevail. If you think about it, we are all like elephants.  We all have incredible power inside us.  And certainly, we have our own chains and pegs – the self-limiting thoughts and beliefs that hold us back.  Sometimes it’s a childhood experience or an old failure.  Sometimes it’s something we were told when we were a little younger. The key thing to realize here is this:  We need to learn from the past, but be ready to update what we learned based on how our circumstances have changed (as they constantly do).  (Angel and I discuss this in detail in the “Adversity” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Many of the most iconic novels, songs, and inventions of all time were inspired by gut-wrenching pain, heartbreak, or failure.  Therefore, the silver lining of these great challenges is that they were the catalyst to the creation of epic masterpieces. An emerging field of psychology called Post-Traumatic Growth has suggested that most people are able to use their hardships and traumas for substantial creative and intellectual development.  Specifically, researchers have found that trauma can help people grow their long-term contentment, emotional strength, and resourcefulness. When our view of the world as a safe place, or as a certain type of place, has been shattered, we are forced to reboot our perspective on things.  We suddenly have the opportunity to look out to the periphery and see things with a fresh set of beginner’s eyes again, which is extremely beneficial to our personal and professional growth. The underlying key is to fully embrace reality and the broad range of experiences you encounter on the road of life, taking the good with the bad.  This includes all of your emotions, all of your ups and downs, all of your blissful moments and painful ones, and the entirety of everything in between.  Life is not just rainbows and butterflies.  It’s intricate, complicated, and remarkable. Fully embracing life in this way means opening yourself to unimaginable possibilities, being vulnerable to unexpected changes, being compassionate with yourself when times are tough, giving yourself some extra love and kindness no matter what happens, and being grateful for the opportunity to experience it all. It means not expecting to always be the perfect human living the perfect life, but instead accepting reality as it is, and accepting yourself as you are, and then making the best of it. We have to say “no” to good things to be able to say “yes” to important things.  We simply can’t do it all.  So be mindful and choose wisely today. What you choose to focus on grows stronger in your life.  At every moment, thousands of little things compete for your attention.  All these things fall into one of two categories: things that are priorities and things that are not. You’ll never get more done by blindly working more hours on everything that comes up – there are only 24 hours in a day. So if you want to be less busy and more successful, don’t ask how to make something more efficient until you’ve first asked, “Do I need to do this at all?” If the answer is “no,” give it up! And remember that giving things up isn’t just about making small, immediate sacrifices.  It’s also about gradually gaining the resources you need to do something significant.  When you give something up you automatically create an opening in your life for something else.  By saying no to everything that’s not aligned with your priorities you make room for what is. If you want to achieve a significant goal or outcome in your life, you have to give up the things that conflict with it.  This doesn’t mean you have to make your life unnecessarily grueling.  It just means you can’t have it all – you have to sacrifice something that you value less than whatever it is you ultimately want to achieve.  For example, you might sacrifice some level of comfort in the present, for a better chance of future achievement. Let me give you a few additional, real-world examples… All details aside, if you want something in life, you have to also want the costs of getting it – you have to be willing to make certain sacrifices.  And it’s up to you, and ONLY YOU, to decide if the juice is worth the squeeze. Many of us are still hopelessly trying to “find our passion” – something we believe will ultimately lead us closer to happiness and success.  And I say “hopelessly” primarily because we are putting the cart ahead of the horse.  When we say we’re trying to find our passion, it implies that our passion is somehow hiding behind a tree or under a rock somewhere.  But that’s far from the truth.  The truth is, our passion comes from doing things right. If you’re waiting to somehow “find your passion” somewhere outside yourself, so you finally have a reason to put your whole heart and soul into life, you’ll likely be waiting around for an eternity. On the other hand, if you’re tired of waiting, and you’d rather live more passionately starting today, it’s time to proactively inject passion into the very next thing you do. Think about it… Like most of us, you’re likely putting a half-hearted and half-minded effort into most of the things you do on a daily basis.  Because you’re still waiting… You’re still waiting to “find” something to be passionate about. What you need to do is the exact opposite! When I was a kid, my grandmother used to tell me, “Stop looking for the next opportunity.  The one you have in front of you is your opportunity.”  She also said, “Too often we spend too much time attempting to perfect something before we ever even do it.  Instead of waiting for perfection, just do your best with what you’ve got right now, and improve it along the way.” Interestingly, recent psychological research indirectly reinforces my grandmother’s sentiments.  For decades psychologists thought that our minds could alter our physical state, but not the other way around.  Nowadays, however, it is widely documented that our bodies – for example, our momentary facial expressions and posture – can directly affect our mental and emotional state.  So while it’s true that we change from the inside out, we also change from the outside in.  And you can leverage this reality in your favor… If you want more passion in your life right now, do something about it right now. Put your heart and soul into something! Not into “the next opportunity,” but the opportunity right in front of you. Not into tomorrow’s work, but today’s work. Not into tomorrow’s workout, but today’s workout. Not into tomorrow’s relationships, but today’s relationships. I’m certain you have plenty in your life right now that’s worth living for.  You have people and circumstances you’re taking for granted.  You have an endless reservoir of untapped potential within you, just waiting. Stop waiting! There is no next opportunity, only the one you have at this moment. Put your heart and soul into what you’ve got right in front of you. And your long-lost passion will show up to greet you. “The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago.  The second best time is now.” That’s a Chinese proverb I constantly use as a guidepost in my life.  It inspires me to work on the goals I’ve been putting off. Look at your life right now… These questions and the thoughts they prompt may be somewhat disheartening, but ignoring them for another five years only makes matters worse.  The disheartening truth is what you must face today if you’re serious about making your goals happen – if you’re serious about making tomorrow’s results better than yesterday’s. Your present position in life is a reflection of your past planning and decision making.  If you want your future to yield better results, you need to make some immediate and formidable changes. Today is the day! Now is the time! You will never feel perfectly ready, and the moment will never be perfectly convenient…to start, to put in the effort, to learn as you go…to gradually get the hard things done.  If it was easier and more convenient, everyone would be operating at a much higher level.  There would be no inner emotional conflicts.  There would be no unrealized dreams. You have to do the hard things to be happy in life – you have to put in the effort. Most people are just waiting around for someone or something outside themselves to pick them up and carry them forward. It’s never going to happen for those people! If you want something from life, you have to want it like you want to breathe.  You have to start doing things today, and every day hereafter, that directly support the outcome you desire.  It may not be easy, but it is just that simple. And remember, you can’t lift 1,000 pounds all at once, however you can easily lift one pound 1,000 times.  In repetition, your little actions have great power.  You become highly skilled at whatever you do again and again.  Every day offers you the opportunity to develop a ritual of success, regardless of your priorities or how you personally define success.  So from this moment forward… May your daily actions speak louder than your words. May your life preach louder than your lips. May your success be your noise in the end. (Angel and I build little, daily, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.) …by bringing our focus back to embracing the truth. How many times have you thought it was the end, when it was really the beginning? How many times have you blamed someone else, for a problem you created yourself? How many excuses have you made, in place of actually trying to do your very best? Think for a moment. Then remind yourself that the truth does not cease to exist when it is ignored. When the truth is ignored and avoided, whether consciously or subconsciously, it just complicates your life.  And there’s absolutely no reason to do that to yourself.  There’s no good reason to weigh yourself down with old stories, half-truths, and falsehoods. Seeking today’s whole truth, speaking today’s whole truth, and living by today’s whole truth is incredibly liberating! I challenge YOU to use the seven points above to do just that. If you’re feeling up to it, we would love to hear from YOU. Which point mentioned above resonates with you the most today, and why? Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

One Surprisingly Simple Rule that Will Make Your Goals Happen Faster|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/make-your-goals-happen-faster.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| Like many people, Angel and I spent years struggling to make even the slightest bit of progress on the goals we had set for ourselves. We started new workout programs with incredible optimism at least a couple dozen times.  We threw away all the junk food in our house more times than I can even remember.  We tried waking up earlier, meditating, reading more often, writing a book, getting out of debt, running a business, and more… But, for the longest time, we failed on all fronts. We’d get started with a new goal, and then we’d get derailed. And boy did we feel horrible! We often felt like losers … like no matter how hard we tried, our goals were out of reach!  And we’d berate ourselves constantly for not being stronger, smarter, and more disciplined. But what Angel and I didn’t realize, until we started successfully achieving our goals a few years later, is that it was never a matter of us not having enough strength, intelligence, or discipline.  It was a matter of us focusing on our goals in an ineffective way. In fact, believe it or not, we were actually focusing on our goals too much. Yes, you read that right.  It sounds counterintuitive, but it’s the truth. Watch this quick video Angel and I recorded for you, and let us explain what we started focusing on instead…  Now that you’ve watched the video, and you have a better understanding of what rituals are and why they’re so incredibly important, it’s time to memorize and live by a simple rule… Goals don’t make positive changes happen, daily rituals do. Seriously, meditate on that for a moment. Because too often we obsess ourselves with a goal – an end result – but are completely unfocused when it comes to the ritual – the recurring steps – that ultimately make the goal happen.  And so the weight of this unrealized goal sits heavy on our shoulders, and it slows us down to a crawl. Does that sound at all familiar? If so, it’s time to shift your focus AWAY from your goals.  Think about this… If you completely ignored one of your goals for the next few weeks and instead focused solely on the daily rituals that reinforce this goal, would you still get positive results? For example, if you were trying to lose weight and you ignored your goal to lose 25 pounds, and instead focused only on eating healthy and exercising each day, would you still get results? YES, you would!  Gradually, you would get closer and closer to your goal without even thinking about it. The bottom line is that nothing will change in your life unless you make daily rituals that reinforce what you hope to achieve.  Believe me, over the past decade Angel and I have successfully worked with thousands of course students and live event attendees from around the world who were struggling to achieve things, so this strategy is well tested.  We’ve tried weekly action steps with people, tasks they do in semi-flexible increments, big monthly milestones, and dozens of other variations and combinations of strategies.  None of them work well in the long run except daily rituals. If you’re not willing to make it a daily ritual, you don’t really want to change your life as much as you say you do – you don’t really want to achieve that “important” goal.  You only like the idea of learning to be fit/writing a book/building a business/selling your art/etc.  You don’t actually want to do it, every day. But if you DO want it as much as you say you do, here are some… (Note: Angel and I build small, daily, life-changing rituals with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of the Getting Back to Happy course.)

"4 Unique Ways to Let Go and Get Over Failure|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/4-let-go-failure.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| Your failure does not define you, your determination does.  Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, smarter than before. It’s a feeling of heaviness deep within you.  You try to ignore it, but you can’t.  Dread and discouragement gradually seep into your thoughts.  Sadness and guilt soon follow, until you are completely defeated. I feel just like this when I fail. It makes me want to curl up into a ball and cry.  I feel lost and alone and I want to give up.  I want to fall on my bed and bury my face in a pillow.  But that doesn’t work, because the sinking feeling just follows me to sleep. Failure is terribly painful on so many levels. People get this idea about me, because I write and teach about success, happiness and mindful living, that I don’t ever slip up and fail miserably in these areas.  But of course I’m human, so that’s not true.  I fail at things much more than you might imagine, and certainly far more than I’d often like to admit. At some point or another I fail at everything, just like you, and it feels just as horrible for me as it does for you or anyone else. I feel letdown and guilty, and try to avoid thinking about it, and would rather hide it. But deep down I know these negative reactions aren’t helpful.  So I own up to what happened, learn a lesson or two, and then get back up and try again.  The last part is the most important part – trying again… When I try over and over again, I often succeed, eventually. If there’s only one thing you take away from this post, let it be that trying again is always worth it.  You get just about as many chances in life as you’re willing to give yourself. Once you’ve got your mind wrapped around that simple principle, here are four unique (and proven) strategies for giving yourself another chance, by letting go and growing beyond your failures: Instead of trying to change our thoughts every moment – via gratitude or deliberate forgiveness, for example – sometimes we simply need to notice our thoughts without getting caught up in them. You are ultimately the sole creator of your own feelings.  When negative thoughts arise based on past experiences or future worries, as they sometimes will, realize that these are simply issues your mind (not you) is working through.  Pause, be present and pay close attention.  Think about these thoughts and emotions consciously, almost as if you were a bystander looking in.  Separate yourself from your mind’s thinking. Perhaps after you study your thoughts and emotions you will think to yourself, “Wow, am I really still working through that?”  And guess what?  Over time your negative feelings and emotions will lessen and genuine awareness, love and acceptance will grow in their place.  You will begin to realize that your mind is just an instrument, and you are in control of your mind, not the other way around. By not judging your thoughts or blaming them on yourself or anyone else, and merely watching them, there will be a big shift within you – your sense of self worth will bloom. It’s not like you won’t fail, or get upset anymore, or never feel anxious, but knowing that your thoughts and emotions are just fleeting feelings that are independent of YOU will help ease your tension and increase your positive presence, allowing you to let go, learn, and begin again, smarter and stronger than before.  (Read The Power of Now.) Every day, all day, you are subconsciously matching patterns from the past with the present.  When an experience in your life has emotional significance, it gets tagged in your brain as being important.  And when the emotional experience is tragic, it triggers your brain’s fear mechanism, which tells your brain to remain on the lookout for any future conditions that vaguely remind you of this tragic experience (it does this to protect you from future harm). Your brain then tries to match new experiences with the original one.  But depending on how emotionally attached you are to the original experience, it can lead to false pattern matches which inevitably lead you astray.  This is especially true when it comes to personal failures, mistakes and misjudgments. For example: Again, these false pattern matches occur whenever you respond negatively and over-emotionally to a particular past experience.  And it all happens subconsciously too.  Logically, you know that all relationships are completely different, but emotionally you respond as if they are one. If you feel that you are stuck because you can’t move beyond a past failed experience, then your brain is relating to it as if it’s still happening right now, which means it’s matching patterns improperly in the present.  Here’s a two-step solution that might help: Even though you intellectually know you’re stronger than you were in the past, your subconscious mind often forgets that your capabilities have grown. Let me give you a quick metaphorical example… Zookeepers typically strap a thin metal chain to a grown elephant’s leg and then attach the other end to a small wooden peg that’s hammered into the ground.  The 10-foot tall, 10,000-pound elephant could easily snap the chain, uproot the wooden peg and escape to freedom with minimal effort.  But it doesn’t.  In fact the elephant never even tries.  The world’s most powerful land animal, which can uproot a tree as easily as you could break a toothpick, remains defeated by a small wooden peg and a flimsy chain. Why? Because when the elephant was a baby, its trainers used the exact same methods to domesticate it.  A thin chain was strapped around its leg and the other end of the chain was tied to a wooden peg in the ground.  At the time, the chain and peg were strong enough to restrain the baby elephant.  When it tried to break away, the metal chain would pull it back.  Sometimes, tempted by the world it could see in the distance, the elephant would pull harder.  But the chain would not budge, and soon the baby elephant realized trying to escape was not possible.  So it stopped trying. And now that the elephant is all grown up, it sees the chain and the peg and it remembers what it learned as a baby – the chain and peg are impossible to escape.  Of course this is no longer true, but it doesn’t matter.  It doesn’t matter that the 200-pound baby is now a 10,000-pound powerhouse.  The elephant’s self-limiting beliefs prevail. If you think about it, we are all like elephants.  We all have incredible power inside us.  And of course, we have our own chains and pegs – the self-limiting beliefs that hold us back.  Sometimes it’s a childhood experience or an early failure.  Sometimes it’s something we were told when we were younger. We need to learn from the past, but be ready to update what we learned based on how our circumstances have changed (as they constantly do). Here are two things to consider: Nothing can be expected and nothing is indefinitely certain in this world.  That is the truth.  And it’s a beautiful thing. You need to understand that none of us are playing with marked cards; sometimes we win and sometimes we lose.  Life always finds its balance.  Don’t expect to get back everything you give.  Don’t expect recognition for every effort you make.  And don’t expect your genius to be instantly recognized or your love to be understood by everyone you encounter. There are things you don’t want to happen but have to accept, things you don’t want to know but have to learn, and people and circumstances you can’t live without but have to let go.  Some things come into your life just to strengthen you, so you can move on without them. Some people call these experiences failures.  I challenge you to see them as positive lessons. As you live and experience things, you must recognize what belongs and what doesn’t, what works and what doesn’t, and then let things go when you know you should.  Not out of pride, inability or arrogance, but simply because not everything is supposed to fit into your life.  So close the door on the past, change the tune, clean your inner space, and get rid of the dust.  Stop being who you once were so you can become who you are today. It’s time to let go of what happened yesterday, and ignite the present potential of your life. I hope you found value in the four strategies above.  I’ve shared them with you because, honestly, I’ve witnessed them help thousands of our coaching/course students over the past decade. Either way, please know we’re all in this together.  I’m far from perfect, just like you.  We all share the commonality of failing to live up to our better nature, and we also share the bond of being able to start again. And that’s what we must do.  Together. Let’s start again.  Today. What failures have you struggled to overcome?  What have you done, or what are you going to do, to let go and get on with your life?  Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

"One Daily Gratitude Ritual that Will Change the Way You Think|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/one-gratitude-ritual.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| The secret to being grateful is no secret. You choose to be grateful. Then you do it again and again. If you forget, begin again. I remember that rainy summer evening – shortly after Angel and I lost two loved ones to illness, lost our livelihood in a layoff, and ultimately lost sight of the goodness that remained in our lives – when I found myself lying down on a tile floor, alone in the dark, just thinking. Angel and I rarely spoke openly about anything meaningful during that period of time, mostly because I was withdrawn.  I felt helpless and essentially depressed about what had happened.  I was lost in the darkness of my own negative thinking. But something shifted inside me as I was lying on that tile floor. As I looked up and out the open window next to me, the moon suddenly broke through the clouds and illuminated the dark room I was in.  Then, within seconds, a light breeze started blowing the white window curtains inward and over me.  As the curtains fluttered in the air four feet over my body, I smiled.  It was a beautiful moment.  And without thinking twice, I whispered out loud, “Life is still a miracle to be grateful for.” Angel walked into the room at that exact moment and whispered, “I agree.” She ducked under the curtains and snuggled into me on the floor.  After a couple moments of shared silence, we decided to list some things off the top of our minds that we were grateful for, despite our struggles. Our list of gratitude looked something like this: And the list went on, of course, but you get the gist.  Even when everything seemed to be wrong, we had a lot going right – a lot to be grateful for. That night I resolved to change my thinking and make gratitude a daily ritual in my life. Nowadays, I spend 20 minutes every evening focusing my thoughts exclusively on what I am grateful for and why.  I call it my gratitude meditation. This may seem like a trivial, clichéd practice to some people, but I’m here to tell you that it’s not at all trivial, and as clichéd as it may seem at first, a ritual like this changes lives. Here’s what has changed in my life, gradually, as I’ve practiced my ritual of gratitude: And this list goes on and on.  But the important thing to realize is that all of these changes are incredibly positive and powerful.  They aren’t trite, and they’re far from being a cliché. My focus on gratitude has fundamentally changed the way I think and live, in the most incredible way imaginable. So what’s the easiest way to create a daily ritual of gratitude in your life? Here’s a super simple, five-minute, daily gratitude ritual that has worked wonders for hundreds of our course students over the past decade (and before I worked my way up to a 20-minute gratitude meditation, this is where I started too): Every evening before you go to bed, write down three things that went well during the day and their causes.  Simply provide a short, causal explanation for each good thing. That’s it.  We spend tens of thousands of dollars on expensive electronics, big homes, fancy cars, and lavish vacations hoping for a boost of happiness and positivity.  This is a simple, free alternative, and it works. If you begin this ritual today, you just might be looking back on today many years from now, as the day when your whole life changed.  (Note: Angel and I build little, life-changing rituals like this with our students in the “Goals and Growth” module of Getting Back to Happy.) And if you need some extra inspiration, reflect on these… Sometimes – on the hardest of days – I still have a tough time mustering up enough positive energy to focus on things to be grateful for.  When this happens, I review my notes on gratitude – the perspectives and lessons I’ve learned over the years that I’ve documented in various archived blog posts (and now our book).  I call these notes my gratitude mantras.  And on those days when everything seems to be going wrong, I will read through them and reflect on them for as long as it takes for me to find a source of gratitude. I pass these mantras on to you in hopes that you will find refuge in them as well.  Repeat them to yourself, and reflect on them, in those dark moments when you’ve lost track of what you have to be grateful for… How has gratitude, or the lack thereof, affected your life and the lives of those you love?  Do you have any thoughts or insights to share?  We would love to hear from you.  Please leave a reply below.

As human beings, we all have an idea in our heads about how things are supposed to be, and sadly this is what often messes our relationships up the most.  We all get frustrated when things don’t play out the way we expect them to, and people don’t behave like they’re “supposed” to.  We expect our spouses and children to act a certain way, our friends to always agree with us, strangers to be less difficult, and so on and so forth. And when reality hits us, and everyone seems to be doing the opposite of what we want them to do, we overreact – frustration, stress, arguments, tears, etc. So what can we do about this? When you feel like your lid is about to blow, take a long, deep breath.  Deep breathing releases tension, calms down our fight or flight reactions, and allows us to quiet our anxious nerves and choose more considerate and constructive responses. So, for example, do your best to take a deep breath next time another driver cuts you off in traffic.  In a recent poll we hosted with our course students, overreacting while fighting traffic was the most commonly cited reason for overreacting.  Just imagine if all the drivers on the road took deep breaths before making nasty hand gestures, or screaming obscenities at others. There’s no doubt that it can drive us crazy when we don’t get what we expect from people, especially when it’s completely out of our control.  But trying to change the unchangeable, wanting others to be exactly the way we want them to be, just doesn’t work.  The alternative, though, is unthinkable to most of us: to breathe, to let go, to lead by example, and to accept people even when they irritate us. Here’s the way of being that I’ve been cultivating and advocating: “Being” this way takes practice, but it’s worth it.  It makes me less frustrated, it helps me to be more mindful, it improves my relationships, it lowers my stress, and it allows me to make the world a slightly nicer place to be.  I hope you will join me. These mantras can help us practice, together… Since, like you, I’m only human, other people’s chaotic behavior still gets an emotional rise out of me sometimes.  So I’ve implemented a simple strategy to help me.  In a nutshell, I proactively remind myself to take a deep breath when I need one, and to practice what I preach.  Anytime I catch myself doing the opposite, I pause and read the following mantras to myself (I keep them on my iPhone).  Then I take some fresh deep breaths, and begin my practice… Can you think of a time when taking a deep breath, and practicing some mindful reflection, saved you from overreacting and responding to someone inappropriately?

One of the best strategies to being emotionally stronger is to give ourselves the love and care we catch ourselves dreaming about receiving from others.  I know this, because I learned this lesson the hard way. There was a point in my life when I felt lousy about my appearance – I was insecure to say the least – and I saw myself as too flabby, too weak, too this, and too that.  Yet I fantasized about other people seeing me as an extraordinary individual worthy of being loved and cared for as I am. It’s a bit silly, isn’t it, that I would dream of others offering me the emotional support I was directly withholding from myself?  When I realized this, I made a change. This was a turning point in my life when the age-old saying “You cannot truly love anyone if you are unable to love yourself first” suddenly made vivid sense to me.  And I also flipped it around on myself too: “Do not expect to receive any specific kind of love and care from someone else that you do not first give to yourself.” But a question remained in my mind:  How? How can I begin to love and care for myself more?  How can I gradually and consistently build more self-love and self-care into my life? After lots of trial and error, and guidance from those wiser than me, I began two powerful rituals that gradually changed everything… In the video clip below, recorded live at our first annual “Think Better, Live Better” conference, Marc and I tell personal stories about the life-changing effects of our unique positive affirmations and gratitude journaling rituals.  Honestly, whenever someone mentions the fact that we’ve turned some pretty big lemons into lemonade over the years, we always point to these two rituals as the keys to our emotional growth and strength.

The author of the third email excerpt above ended her email with this line:  “I know I don’t have a lot of friends, but I’m sure grateful I have a couple worth fighting for.” And that’s exactly what I want to reflect on in this post – 10 types of friends worth fighting for… There are countless intricacies to every great friendship, but the foundation is always incredibly simple: making time for each other.  The key is to hang in, stay connected, fight for them, and let them fight for you.  Don’t walk away when the going gets a little tough, don’t be distracted too easily, don’t be too busy or tired, and don’t take them for granted.  Friends are part of the glue that holds life and happiness together.  It’s powerful stuff! So put down the smart phone, close the laptop and enjoy each other’s company, face to face, the old fashioned way. There are few joys that equal a good conversation, a genuine laugh, a long walk, a friendly dance, or a big hug shared by two people who care about each other.  Sometimes the most ordinary things can be made extraordinary simply by doing them with the right people.  You know this!  Choose to be around these people, and choose to make the most of your time together. Healthy, long-term friendships are amazing, but rarely easygoing 24/7.  Why?  Because they require flexibility and compromise. Two different people will always have two slightly different perspectives about the same situation.  Resisting this truth and seeing the hard times as immediate evidence that something is catastrophically wrong, or that you’re supposed to see eye-to-eye on everything, only aggravates the difficulties.  By contrast, finding the willingness to view the challenges as learning opportunities will give you the energy and strength you need to continue to move forward and grow your friendship for decades to come. Sometimes we see our worst selves…. our most vulnerable and weak selves.  We need someone else to get close enough to tell us we’re wrong.  Someone we trust.  That’s what true friends are for. Simply believing in another person, and showing it in words and deeds on a consistent basis, can make a HUGE difference in their life.  Several studies of people who grew up in dysfunctional homes but who grew up to be happy and successful show that the one thing they had in common was someone who believed in them.  Be this ‘someone’ for those you care about.  Support their dreams.  Participate with them.  Cheer for them.  Be nothing but encouraging.  Whether they actually follow through with their present dreams, or completely change their minds, is irrelevant; your belief in them is of infinite importance, either way.  (Read The Mastery of Love.) When we honestly ask ourselves which friends have helped us the most, we often find that it’s those special few who, instead of giving lots of advice, specific solutions, or quick cures, have chosen rather to share in our challenges and touch our wounds with a listening ear and a loving heart. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of pain and mourning, who can tolerate not knowing or having all the answers, not curing and fixing everything in an instant, and instead simply face the reality of our momentary powerlessness with us, that is a friend worth fighting for. Be gentle and compassionate with your friends as they evolve and change.  Mother Nature opens millions of flowers every day without forcing the buds.  Let this be a reminder not to be forceful with those you care about, but to simply give them enough light and love, and an opportunity to grow naturally. Ultimately, how far you go in life depends on your willingness to be helpful to the young, respectful to the aged, tender with the hurt, supportive of the striving, and tolerant of those who are weaker or stronger than the majority.  Because we wear many hats throughout the course of our lives, at some point in your life you will have been all of these people, and the same is true for your friends. No human being is your friend who demands your silence or denies your right to grow. Healthy friendships always move in the direction of personal growth: for the relationship as a whole and for each individual in it.  A desire to impede the growth of the other for one’s personal comfort is an expression of fear. When you connect with a true friend, this person helps you find the best in yourself.  In this way, neither of you actually meet the best in each other; you both grow into your best selves by spending time together and nurturing each other’s growth. Subconsciously, many of us prefer gentle lies to hard truths.  But make no mistake, in the end it’s better to be hurt by the truth than comforted by a lie.  Friendships based on lies always die young. Lying is a cumulative process too.  So be careful.  What starts as a small, seemingly innocent lie (possibly even with the intention of not hurting anyone) quickly spirals into a mounting fairytale where the biggest factor preventing you from sharing the truth is the unwanted reputation of being known as a liar. Don’t do this.  Don’t hide behind lies. Deal with the truth, learn the lessons, endure the consequences of reality, and move your friendship forward. Giving your friends the space to save face, and not taking things personally, when they’re occasionally upset, cranky or having a bad day is a priceless gift. Truth be told, what others say and do is often based entirely on their own self-reflection.  When a friend who is angry and upset speaks to you, and you nevertheless remain very present and continue to treat them with kindness and respect, you place yourself in a position of great power.  You become a means for the situation to be graciously diffused and healed. My grandmother once told me, “When somebody backs themselves into a corner, look the other way until they get themselves out; and then act as though it never happened.”  Allowing a friend to save face in this way, and not reminding them of what they already know is not their most intelligent behavior, is an act of great kindness.  This is possible when you realize that people behave in such ways because they are in a place of momentary suffering.  People react to their own thoughts and feelings and their behavior often has nothing directly to do with you. This may seem obvious, but these days it’s worth mentioning:  NEVER post negatively about a friend on social media.  Fourteen-year-old school kids post negatively about their friends on social media.  It’s a catty way to get attention and vent, when the emotionally healthy response is to talk your grievances over with them directly when the time is right. Don’t fall into the trap of getting others on your side either, because healthy friendships only have one side – it’s called mutual respect. Furthermore, friendships and their intricacies don’t always make sense, especially from the outside.  So don’t let outsiders run your friendship for you.  If you’re having an issue with a friend, work it out with THEM and no one else.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Sometimes life puts geographic barriers between you and a good friend.  But growing apart geographically doesn’t change the fact that for a long time you two grew side by side; your roots will always be tangled.  Knowing this, embracing it, and making the best of it… that’s a clear sign of true friendship. In the end, this ‘true’ kind of friendship is a promise made in the heart – silent, unwritten, unbreakable by distance, and unchangeable by time.

"5 Ways to Stop Worrying About What Everyone Thinks of You|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/5-stop-worrying.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| 12 Toxic Beliefs You Need Out of Your Mind|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/12-beliefs-out-mind.jpg?resize=500%2C334&ssl=1| 2 Ways to Bounce Back from Life’s Inevitable Setbacks|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-lifes-setbacks.jpg?resize=500%2C500&ssl=1|It’s your choice…  To be positive and free or to be imprisoned by your own negativity.  To live in the past or to be hopeful about the present.(Note: This post was expanded and updated here: 5 Lessons I Learned from Overcoming the Hardest Days of My Life)1.  Clear the unnecessary clutter and complications standing in your way.As Einstein once said, “Out of clutter, find simplicity; from discord, find harmony; in the middle of difficulty, lies opportunity.”Sometimes we make life more complicated than it is.  We attach our happiness to achievement and then look for it in all the wrong ways and in all the wrong places.  Of course, you don’t have to live like this.  If you feel like you are, it’s time to simplify things.  It’s time to clear the air and get back to the basics.Simplifying is not seeing how little you can get by with – that’s poverty – but how efficiently you can put first things first, and use your time accordingly to pursue the things that make a difference and mean the most to you.  Less truly is more.  Instead of adding, improve your life by subtracting.  Get rid of unnecessary clutter, negative influences and toxic relationships.  There’s a big difference between what you want and what you need, between what’s excessive and what’s essential.  (Angel and I discuss this process in the Simplicity chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.)2.  Reach out and help people.Our setbacks are often mostly about us, wallowing in our own self-pity.  This doesn’t sound great, but we all do it almost every day to a small extent without noticing it.  When you catch yourself doing this, know that the best antidote is to get outside yourself, stop being self-centered, and re-focus on the people around you.  Try to find a way to help someone else.  It will inevitably, infallibly, make you feel better.When we realize that helping others is the key to realizing our own happiness, it saves us a lot of trouble.Truth be told, the closest thing to being cared for is to care for others.  We are all in this together and we should treat each other as such.  Use your voice for kindness, your ears for compassion, and your hands for charity, always.  No exercise is better for your heart and mind than reaching down and helping others up.  Happiness and success in life doesn’t come through selfishness, but through selflessness.  The best way to feel alive on down days is to get up and do something positive for the folks around you.And remember, you don’t need a reason to help someone.  Just do it.  The reason will come to you.Your turn…What helps you persevere and bounce back from life’s setbacks?  How do you motivate yourself through difficult situations on a daily basis?  Leave a comment below and share your thoughts and insights?Photo by: Daniel Smith 3 Ways to Make Your Life Simple and Successful Again|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/3-simple-successful.jpg?resize=500%2C332&ssl=1|“There is no greatness where there is not simplicity, goodness, and truth.”?Leo TolstoyThis post has been updated and moved to HERE:How to Stop Feeling Overwhelmed (by Everything on Your Plate)Photo by: Colton Witt 3 Beliefs You Have that Hold You Back|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/3-beliefs.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1|You are the person you believe yourself to be.This post has been updated with new information and moved to here:3 Easy Things We Say to Avoid the Hard Things We Need to DoPhoto by: Brandon Grasley "
"9 Ways Generous People View the World Differently|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/9-generous-people.jpg?resize=500%2C388&ssl=1|Traveling light with just a “carry-on” is an appealing idea, but many people hesitate to give it a try. It’s often easier to stick with what we know, packing everything “just in case,” rather than embracing a new, lighter way of traveling. But those who have made the switch to packing lighter often find the benefits far outweigh the initial uncertainty. In fact, I used to be a heavy packer. Our family of four would always check luggage at the airport whenever we flew home to see family—twice/year. For us, the journey of shifting travel habits began when I was introduced to minimalism. As we began owning less at home, it seemed reasonable that a next step would be to apply the principles of minimalism to my travel habits. And while I don’t remember exactly the first vacation that we decided to bring just carry-on luggage, I do remember how easy it made traveling and committing to never going back to the way we used to travel. Similarly, I went on an international trip recently with a friend and told him that we were not waiting at baggage claim and that he had to pack in a carry-on for the trip. As we completed the trip and breezed through customs back home in the states, he turned to me and said, “You were right! This is so much easier. I am never checking luggage again.” As a family, we follow the same practice on almost every trip. Each of us packs a carry-on—no more. Even on last summer’s book tour, which was close to three weeks long, we all packed our individual belongings in individual carry-on size suitcases. This not only makes it easy to pack up and unload, it also eliminates the chaos of individuals shuffling through a large suitcase with multiple peoples’ stuff inside. If the prospect of making this switch intrigues you, you’ll love it! Here are some practical steps to help you get started: Break free from the mindset that traveling lightly is unattainable, or that your specific circumstances make it impossible. People do it all the time. In fact, folks from every walk of life manage to pack lightly. Every age, every gender, every length of trip, every family size. If they can do it, you can too. My mom once said to me, “Overpacking is lazy packing.” And she’s right! Adopting a minimalist packing approach requires careful planning—thinking through your daily needs and choosing items that fulfill those requirements without excess. But thoughtful effort made on the front-end of the trip saves physical and mental (stress) effort during the trip. Avoid the common pitfall of randomly tossing items into your suitcase. Plan your outfits according to your activities for each day. As I’ll mention later, consider opportunities to mix-and-match and repurpose (especially outerwear). Choose clothing items that offer flexibility—pieces that can be mixed and matched. Neutral colors are your friends. Consider the potential for layering. For example, a light sweater can instantly transform any summer outfit into one suitable for a chilly evening. It might seem unconventional, but most people won’t notice at all. I mean, I’m not suggesting you wear dirty clothes over and over again, but most articles of clothing (especially pants) can be worn more than once between washings.  Don’t be afraid to wear the same outfit more than once, especially if you’re mixing and matching different pieces. For longer trips, washing clothes becomes a necessity. Look for accommodations with laundry facilities or locate nearby laundromats. Many hotels have washing machines available—as do most Airbnb’s. If necessary, you can even hand wash items. You won’t have room to bring back a bunch of souvenirs, but you’ll love not having to spend time shopping on your trips. Remember, travel is about the experience, not the material possessions you bring back. If you do need to prove to yourself or someone else that you went on a trip, photos or small mementos like postcards can be as meaningful, if not more, than bulky souvenirs. You won’t be able to bring large amounts of liquids in your carry-on (at least if you are flying). So make an extra point to think this through. Most toiletries are sold in travel/sample size. That’s what I take. But for very specific items, there are TSA-compliant items to help you keep below the legal limit. If you find that you’re really close, but can’t quite fit in a carry-on suitcase, try rolling your clothes to save space, rather than folding them flat. You’ll be surprised how much more clothing you can pack with this method. It does require an iron on the other end of your trip. So I don’t love the method all the time. But if you’re super-close to making it happen, and there’s an iron on the other end, give it a shot! Personally, I’m more likely to roll my clothes for the return trip where there’s a washing machine waiting for me when I get home. But you can do it either way. Shoes can be the biggest suitcase hoggers. Stick to a couple versatile pairs that work for different occasions and consider wearing your bulkiest pair during transit. One common justification for overpacking is the fear of running out of clothes. The thinking is, “I’d rather have more than I need on a trip, than be lacking something.” On the surface, this argument seems logical. But dig a little deeper, and you’ll find that it overlooks the drawbacks of excess baggage. Extra clothes mean more weight to carry, more items to keep track of, more time spent packing and unpacking, more worries about losing luggage, and more time wasted (arriving much earlier to check your luggage at the airport and time waiting at the baggage carousel waiting for your bag to appear). Contrast this with the benefits of a minimalist approach: simplicity, convenience, and the joy of focusing on the travel experience rather than managing belongings. With careful planning, the benefits—saving time, reducing stress, and the joy of traveling lightly—far outweigh the minor inconvenience of potentially doing a little laundry. If you’ve never tried it, I recommend it. I can almost guarantee, at the end of your first trip, you’ll think to yourself, “You were so right! This is much easier. I am never checking luggage again.” Living in today's world means being constantly surrounded by a culture of consumerism, where value is routinely assigned to how much we own, how much money we spend, how expensive our possessions are, and often times, how much we can show off to … Read More Note: This is a guest post by Winnie of Her Digital Coffee.“I’ve found that the less stuff I own, the less my stuff owns me.” —Nathan W.

On my birthday many moons ago, when Google and I were both a lot younger, I Googled “how to change your life when you’re stuck” to see what would come up.  I had been feeling hopelessly trapped – I was busy racing around in circles every day without any meaningful progress.  I knew I needed to find a better roadmap as I was getting depressed with the same old grind. Granted, I was working 60+ hours a week, struggling with a failing business, and coping with the recent deaths of two loved ones.  The stress and pace of life just seemed to keep me busy from 7am to midnight every day without much time for self-reflection and mindfulness, and deep down I knew the head-spinning, circular path I was on wasn’t sustainable. As I scrolled through Google’s search results I was fascinated by the overwhelming quantity of books, articles and quotes all designed to motivate a person to take positive action and make positive changes.  Messages of “Let Go and Move On” or “Be Present” were plentiful; however, nothing truly clicked with me.  I was looking for guidance that was a bit more specific… guidance like “Walk seven blocks down Main Street and turn right onto Sunshine Drive.  Your ‘better’ path begins there.” I continued to read and look for a new set of directions I could follow, and then it hit me.  My losses and personal turmoil had me running and hiding from my problems.  I was doing an incredible job being incredibly busy, but I had never stopped to sort out my thoughts and figure out exactly why I was doing what I was doing.  My “needs” to provide for my family and ease the pain endured from failure and loss, fueled my mindlessness – I used these circumstances as excuses for not sorting my priorities out effectively – and I became stuck in a circle of futile busyness with no crystal clear vision about anything at all. I recognized that in order to truly move my life forward, I first had to step on the brakes.  I needed to stop dead in my tracks and pause for a little while so I could take it all in, sit with it, and then breathe it all out again.  I had to give myself the space to accept where I was, and sort through the possibilities ahead of me. When I did pause, I began to think of the summer after my high school graduation.  My thoughts time-traveled back to those days when I felt like opportunity awaited me in every imaginable direction.  I had been accepted to a great university, I was young and ambitious, and I was ready to conquer my dreams.  But remembering this didn’t make me feel better.  In fact, all these years later, trying to look at the world through this youthful lens for more than a few minutes only made me feel more restless. Maybe it’s the life lessons I was forced to learn the hard way, or the toll of pain and failure, but I had to admit to myself right then and there that the youthful world of possibility felt a whole lot scarier and riskier this time around.  I wanted to be ambitious and passionate again, but I didn’t know how, until my wise mom gave me some good advice.  She told me that she could still see the positive, passionate young man inside of me, but that I needed to do some soul searching to reconnect myself to him. As I attempted to follow my mom’s advice, I remembered that I used to have two quotes written on post-it notes hanging on my bedroom wall when I was a kid: So I wrote the two quotes down again, just as I remembered them, and posted them up on the wall over my nightstand.  I woke up to these quotes every morning for several years thereafter, and they helped keep me centered. I also took tiny steps, day in and day out, until I knew I was finally moving down the right path again.  For anybody else who feels stuck and without a real sense of how to take the next step forward, I offer the following reminders.  They are based entirely on my personal experiences, but they are the simple, actionable lessons that kept me moving forward when I decided it was time for a change.  Perhaps they will help you too.  Remember… You can post meaningful quotes on your bedroom wall, or find a coffee a mug that has a motivational message on it (mine says “Every Day a Miracle is Born”).  But you can also take it a step further than that too… Few good things come easy, and when the going gets tough we often take the easy way out – even though the easy way takes us the wrong way. To combat this, I create tangible reminders that pull me back from the brink of my weak impulses.  For example, I have my laptop’s desktop background set to a photo of my family, both because I love looking at them and because, when work gets really tough, these photos remind me of the people I am ultimately working for. And I’m not the only one who’s successfully using this strategy… A friend of mine who has paid off almost $100K of debt in the past five years has a copy of his credit card balance taped to his computer monitor; it serves as a constant reminder of the debt he still wants to pay off.  Another friend keeps a photo of herself when she was 90 pounds heavier on her refrigerator as a reminder of the person she never wants to be again. Think of moments when you are most likely to give in to impulses that keep you stuck and take you farther away from your ultimate goals.  Then use visual reminders of those goals to interrupt the impulse and rebuild the momentum that keeps you on the right track. Pausing for a brief second to end the chaos and busyness can save your life by winning you back precious time and peace of mind.  Pausing can also provide you with a break in the habitual action, so you can begin again in a new direction when needed.  But you have to leave enough space in your schedule to do so. It’s tempting to fill in every waking minute of the day with busyness.  Don’t do this to yourself.  Leave space. Leave a little space between every one of your commitments.  Take a break to breathe and meditate, take a short walk outside, drink a glass of water, or perhaps do some simple deep stretching exercises.  Appreciate the space, and just be. Your ultimate goal is living a life uncluttered by most of the distractions people fill their lives with, leaving you with space for what truly matters.  A life that isn’t constant busyness, rushing, and resistance, but instead mindful contemplation, creation and connection with people and projects you truly love. J.K. Rowling keeps a journal.  Eminem keeps a journal.  Oprah keeps a journal. Successful people – those who consistently make positive changes in their life – track their progress, set goals, reflect, and learn from their mistakes.  And they often use some kind of journal to accomplish this. If you want to get somewhere in life, you need a map, and your journal is that map.  You can write down what you did today, what you tried to accomplish, where you made mistakes, and so forth.  It’s a place to reflect.  It’s a place to capture important thoughts.  It’s a place to be able to track where you’ve been and where you intend to go.  It’s one of the most underused, yet incredibly effective tools available to the masses. Set aside 15 minutes a day to think and write.  When I first started my daily journaling ritual I had to wake up earlier in order to make it happen, but I did, and at 6am it was just me and my motivational coffee mug staring down at a blank white page.  I started writing down my dreams, things I had always wanted to do, ideas I had always wanted to explore, places I had always wanted to visit with my family, etc.  Then I zeroed in on the present by writing about tasks I wanted to complete ASAP, related business ideas I wanted to implement ASAP, blog posts I wanted to write ASAP, and other near-term, actionable goals. To this day, I still journal almost every morning.  And reviewing my notes at the end of the day/week/month always helps me feel positive about all the opportunities still out there for me to explore and achieve.  (Read The Miracle Morning.) When you’re moving through a sizeable life transition, it’s important to have close family and friends around you that can offer their support and understanding.  There’s no room for needless negativity.  It’s like the transition phase in labor – that last phase before a woman gives birth to a new life.  She can’t possibly stop to take on other people’s problems or feel guilty about not returning text messages.  She needs to protect her thoughts, her time, and her energy. This same principle applies to you.  If you find that you have a toxic, draining relationship that’s constantly bringing you down and keeping you stuck, let them go for a while.  They may not be an inherently bad person, but they’re not the right person to be spending time with every day. Remember, not all toxic relationships are agonizing and uncaring on purpose.  Some of them involve people who care about you – people who have good intentions, but are toxic because their needs and way of existing in the world force you to compromise yourself and your happiness. And as hard as it is, we have to distance ourselves enough to give ourselves space to live. You simply can’t ruin yourself on a daily basis for the sake of someone else.  You have to make your well-being a priority.  Whether that means spending less time with someone, loving a family member from a distance, letting go entirely, or temporarily removing yourself from a situation that feels painful – you have every right to leave and create some healthy space for yourself.  (Angel and I discuss this in detail in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) All details aside, when it comes to making a substantial change in your life – earning a new degree, building a new business, fostering a new relationship, starting a family, becoming more mindful, or any other personal journey that takes time and commitment – one thing you have to ask yourself is: “Am I willing to spend a little time every day like many people won’t, so I can spend the better part of my life like many people can’t?” Think about it.  We ultimately become what we repeatedly do.  The acquisition of knowledge doesn’t mean you’re growing – growing happens when what you know changes how you live. And remember that this change doesn’t happen all at once.  It happens just one small step at a time.  When it comes to making changes, less is more. After I recovered from feeling stuck, being able to think clearly and plan again had me filling journal entries with ideas and mile-long to-do lists.  However, I learned quickly that it’s unrealistic to accomplish 100 tasks a day, so I pared down and forced myself to make a daily list of no more than three core things I had to do in order to move myself forward.  I began to feel empowered rather than overwhelmed since I took everything in smaller, manageable steps. If you can relate to this post, remember, you are NOT alone.  Every one of us occasionally struggles with faulty habits, beliefs and behaviors that keep us stuck and running in place for awhile.  The key is awareness – recognizing these negative forces and stopping them before they stop you.

When we think about walking with the dreamers, the believers, the creative types, the planners, the doers, the remarkably successful people with their heads in the clouds and their feet on the ground, we get excited.  We want to jump on their bandwagon, join the party and hoot and holler!  We let their spirit ignite a fire within us to leave this world better than when we found it. And that’s great! But what we often neglect, at least initially, is the fact that these “successful” people have been working hard and quietly, often for long, tedious periods of time, to achieve what others eventually interpret as remarkable work. The truth is, the result of remarkable success is pretty noisy – lots of people noticing, talking, and sharing stories about it.  The actual process of achieving remarkable success, on the other hand, is far more discreet (and underappreciated).  But it’s this gradual process that happens quietly, behind-the-scenes, that makes all the difference in the world. People have said that Angel and I are remarkably successful at what we do.  Forbes interviewed me recently and classified our blog as “one of the most popular personal development blogs.”  Although I’m a bit too humble to envision myself in this light, if you’ve ever wondered how Angel and I work to achieve the levels of success others speak of, the candid video interview below is for you.  In it our friend Thanh, from Asian Efficiency, interrogates us and has us dissect some of the quiet, behind-the-scenes rituals that keep us moving successfully forward on a daily basis…  If you’re interested in meeting and speaking with us live in the flesh, we’re hosting a live event on February 18-19, 2017 in South Florida.  The event is titled Think Better, Live Better. This one-day event will be packed full of practical content and unforgettably inspiring lessons.  But this is more than an event, it’s a powerful training seminar that will give you proven tools to identify and transform the negative, self-limiting beliefs and behaviors that often keep us stuck. You won’t leave Think Better, Live Better with a notebook full of ideas and nothing checked off your to-do list.  You’ll set into motion a realistic series of life-changing rituals you can keep improving on for years to come.

"12 Toxic Attitudes that Push Happiness Away From You|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/12-toxic-happiness.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| 8 Things to Remember When Your Relationship Gets Rough|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/75-relationship-quotes.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| There is a purpose for everyone you will ever meet.  Some will test you, some will teach you, and some will bring out the very best in you. You never know when life is about to teach you a new lesson.  You simply can’t plan for it.  Some lessons just seem to sneak up on you when you least expect them.  This is especially true when it comes to relationships.  There have been times in my personal and professional relationships when I wish a lesson had come a bit earlier, to save me from heartache and the wasted time and energy of learning things the hard way. That being said, I am grateful for every lesson my relationships have taught me over the years because I am now better equipped to deal with rough patches when they arise.  And that’s exactly what I want cover with you today – eight things I’ve learned to keep in mind when a relationship gets rough.  These aren’t solutions to specific problems, but rather simple reminders that will help you look at many common relationship problems more objectively. It’s impossible to know exactly how another person is feeling or what kind of emotional battles they’re fighting.  Sometimes the widest smiles hide the thinnest strands of self-confidence and hope.  Sometimes the ‘rich’ have everything but happiness.  Realize this as you interact with others, long before you pass judgment.  Every smile or sign of strength hides an inner struggle every bit as complex and extraordinary as your own. It’s a sage fact of life, really, that every one of us encompasses a profound and unique set of secrets and mysteries that are absolutely undetectable to everyone else, including those closest to us. Yes, there will be those who are critical of you regardless of what you do or how well you do it.  If you say you want to be a dancer, they will discredit your rhythm.  If you say you want to build a new business, they will give you a dozen reasons why it might not work.  They somehow assume you don’t have what it takes, but they are dead wrong. Do not engage deeply in a relationship that is holding you back, day in and day out. It’s a lot easier to be negative than positive – a lot easier to be critical than correct.  When you’re embarking on a new venture, instead of listening to the few critics that will try to discredit you, spend time talking to one of the millions of people in this world who are willing to support your efforts and acknowledge your potential.  (Read Emotional Vampires.) Holding a resentful grudge is like drinking toxic venom and waiting for the other person to grow ill.  It’s an exercise in futility.  And just as toxic venom is to the human body, so is resentment to the human spirit – even one tiny bit is bad for you. Don’t magnify life’s difficulties by filling your mind with resentment.  Instead, ease your burdens by choosing to let them go.  If you feel resentful feelings starting to take hold, stop and consider the fact that there’s nothing to be gained by bringing yourself down over what has already happened. Let today be the day you stop letting the ghosts of yesterday haunt you.  Let today be the day you stop poisoning yourself with needless hatred.  Forget about getting even with someone who hurt you, and instead get even with those who have helped. When someone has hurt you it’s hard to be peaceful.  But you do it anyway because you know peace is the only battle worth waging.  Peace is beautiful; it is the manifestation of your love and the best resolution for a brighter future. Being peaceful is hard sometimes – much harder than being angry and vengeful.  It requires you to stay calm and let go of the pain.  It requires you to forgive and move on.  Of course, you don’t do these things just for the person who has hurt you, but for your own well-being. Whether it’s a friendship or an intimate relationship, when someone loves you, you know it.  When they look your way, the world looks better.  When they say your name, the world sounds better.  When they touch your skin, the world feels better.  You know your soul is safe in their care. But even more so than any physical interaction, there’s a silent connection between you that you can feel in your veins.  You can sit in front of them for hours, without saying a word or moving a muscle, and yet still feel them with your heart.  It’s almost like they’ve always been a part of you – like a long lost fragment of your essence has found its way home. It’s important to note though, that you learn about this kind of love slowly as a relationship grows.  It’s not something you realize all at once.  It’s about how two people treat each other, respect each other, and work together over a prolonged period, through good times and bad.  (Read The Road Less Traveled.) If you’re still searching for the perfect partner or friendship, stop.  There’s no such thing.  There are only different flavors of imperfect ones.  In fact, you are just as imperfect as the partner or friend you seek.  You simply need to find someone whose imperfections complement your own. This process doesn’t happen overnight. It takes a lot of living to grow into the realization of your own imperfections.  It takes lots of life experience before you bump into your deepest inner demons, your greatest flaws, and all the idiosyncrasies that make you, YOU.  And it’s only after you meet these imperfect parts of yourself that you know who you are looking for – someone whose scars and flaws fit your own – someone who’s imperfect in the perfect way for you. Be careful not to continuously doubt the positives of your partner (or friend) and then ignore your own negative behavior.  You likely do this more often than you think.  For instance, you will say to your partner dozens of times:  Do you really love me?  Are you sure?  And ask similar questions that doubt the existence of their love.  But you will rarely ask:  Does this upset you?  Are you sure?  And similar questions that have the potential to resolve conflict before it starts. This imbalance creates tension on both sides of the equation.  The positive things become more burdensome while the negatives fester in the background, unresolved.  Bottom line:  Have faith in the positives as you work on turning the negatives around, or simply accepting them. Relationships with others are important, but you need alone time sometimes, because when you’re in solitude you’re free from obligations and external pressures.  You’re free to be YOU without being fancy and putting on a show.  You’re able to hear your own thoughts and follow through with them, sincerely. Go ahead and find a quiet place.  Stretch your boundaries.  Explore places you’ve never been.  Go so far away from what you know that you stop being afraid of the unfamiliar. Cherish your time alone.  Take long walks and drives by yourself.  Watch sunsets and sunrises silently in peace.  Teach yourself something new.  Read books.  Write poetry.  Sing along to your favorite songs.  Check your instincts and follow them on your own time, without third party influence.  Decide if fitting in 24/7 is more important than discovering who you truly are and what you’re here to do.  Once you’ve got a handle on this, relationships with others get a lot easier.  (Marc and I discuss this in the “Self-Love” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) All relationships, including the one you have with yourself, require patience and work.  No meaningful relationship will work flawlessly all the time.  Being too black and white about the expectations of what should or shouldn’t happen in a relationship always spells trouble.  No matter what, there will be difficulties present, but you can still focus on the good.  Instead of constantly looking for signs of what’s not working in your relationships, what you need to do is look for signs of what is.  Because, as you know, what we focus on grows. What would you add to the list?  What do you try to keep in mind when a relationship gets rough?  Please leave a comment below and share your thoughts and insights with the community.

As I watched a re-run of the Academy Awards last night at a friend’s house, I noticed an obvious commonality between many of the speeches actors and actresses make when they accept an award.  It goes something like: “This means so much so me.  My whole life has been leading up to this moment.” The interesting thing about this sentiment, I think, is that our whole lives have been leading up to every moment.  Think about that for a second.  Every single thing you’ve gone through in life, every high, every low, and everything in between, it has all led you to the moment you’re experiencing right now. This means that you are exactly where you need to be to get to where you want to go.  It’s just a matter of taking one new step in the right direction, and another, and another. Start with a simple question: What do you want to change in your life? Are you hoping to someday be in better physical shape, a runner, a writer, an artist, a graphic designer, a programmer, a teacher, a better parent, a successful entrepreneur, or an expert at something specific? How do you get to where you want to go?  Do you write your intention on a note card, and place it in a bottle and cast it out to sea, hoping the universe reads it and manifests it in your life?  No.  The universe isn’t going to make your desires happen.  You are. Do you set yourself a concrete goal to complete within a year, or within three years?  Sure, but that alone doesn’t get the job done.  In fact, if you think back on previous examples in your life, setting lofty, long-term goals probably hasn’t worked for you very often.  How many times has this strategy led you to the outcome you desired? Here’s the truth:  Goals don’t make positive changes happen, rituals do. What’s the difference between goals and rituals? Now think about this:  If you ignored your goals for a while and focused solely on your rituals, would you still get positive results? For example, if you were trying to lose weight and you ignored your goal to lose 20 pounds, and instead focused only on eating healthy and exercising each day, would you still get results? Yes, you would.  Gradually, you would get closer and closer to your goal without even thinking about it again. I’m going to lay down the law here, based on over a decade of experience helping our coaching/course students achieve the changes and results they desire, what I have learned is this: Nothing will change unless you make a daily ritual that reinforces your goal. I’ve tried weekly action steps with people, things they do every other day, big monthly milestones, and dozens of other variations and combinations of strategies.  None of them work well in the long run except daily rituals. If you’re not willing to make it a daily ritual, you don’t really want to change your life as much as you say you do.  You only like the idea of learning to be fit/writing a book/building a business/selling your art/etc.  You don’t actually want to do it, every day. Bottom line:  If you want it as much as you say you do, make it a daily ritual. Let’s look at a few super common goals: How do you turn those lofty goals into daily rituals?  Think about what you could do every day that would get you closer to your desired outcome, even if it were only the tiniest imaginable step forward.  Of course, this is not always easy to figure out, but let’s look at some ideas: You get the idea.  Not all of these specific rituals will work for you and your unique situation, but you could come up with something similar that works better for you.  In any case, the principle applies: Create a ritual and live by it daily. This 7-step process is fairly simple and, if you diligently stick to it, basically infallible: That’s it.  Ritualize these seven steps, and you’ve got a changed life.  I challenge you to put them into action today. And of course, if you’re struggling with any of this, know that you are not alone.  Many of us are right there with you, working hard to make positive changes, think more clearly, and get our lives back on track.  This is precisely why Angel and I built “Getting Back to Happy.”  The course is filled with time-tested steps on how to do just that.  We’d love to work with you directly, if you’re up to it.

Of course, that’s easier said than done, because it can be so confusing, right? … Why you get overwhelmed by run-of-the-mill tasks that others take in stride.  Why you mull over slights that ought to be forgotten.  Why subtleties are magnified for you and yet lost on others. It’s like you were born missing a protective layer of skin that others seem to have. You try to hide it.  Numb it.  Tune it out.  But the comments still pierce your armor: “You’re overthinking things.  You’re too sensitive.  Toughen up!” You’re left wondering what on earth is wrong with you. I know, because I was in my mid-40s when I stumbled across the term ‘highly sensitive people.’  This led me to discover how delicious it feels to be one of thousands saying, “You do that?  Me too!” Since then, I’ve learned that many sensitive people feel isolated from others.  They feel misunderstood and different, and they usually don’t know why.  They just don’t realize that they have a simple trait that explains their confusing array of symptoms and quirks. There’s even a scientific term for it: Sensory Processing Sensitivity.  Dr. Elaine Aron, a psychotherapist and researcher, estimates that 15-20% of people have nervous systems that process stimuli intensely.  They think deeply.  They feel deeply (physically and emotionally).  They easily become over-stimulated. According to my research several successful historical figures were highly sensitive, such as Albert Einstein, Martin Luther King, and Steve Jobs.  I see this as great news, because it means us sensitive types aren’t inherently disadvantaged. But when we don’t realize how to handle our sensitivity, we end up pushing too hard to keep up with everyone else.  We try to do what others seem to handle with ease, and try to do it better than them.  And this leads to problems. For a time, we do a first-rate job of using our natural gifts: we’re creative students, conscientious employees, and devoted family members.  But when we hammer on beyond our limits, doing so can eventually take its toll.  It shows up in things like unrelenting health conditions, muscle tension we can’t get rid of, and being endlessly fatigued or on edge for no good reason. If you resonate with any of this, here are 10 actions you can take to stop struggling and start thriving: Sensitivity is a temperament trait, not a medical disorder.  So nothing is inherently wrong with you.  Sadly, though, many certified health practitioners don’t understand this because sensory processing sensitivity is a recent area of health research. Sure, highly sensitive people are more likely to have allergies or sensitivities to food, chemicals, medication, and so forth.  And they’re more prone to overstimulation, thus quicker to feel stress — which can lead to other health issues.  But sensitivity in itself is not something that needs fixing. Successful sensitive types realize that they’re not “broken.”  If your mind is exhausted from busily researching yet another solution to take away your “flaws,” know that the answers to living in harmony with your sensitive nature lie inside you. Impostor syndrome isn’t exclusive to highly sensitive people.  Many conscientious and high achieving people fall victim to this nagging fear.  But the simmering discomfort about being found out is often constant for a sensitive person. Why wouldn’t it be, considering you’ve spent a lifetime of feeling different from others and trying to fit in?  Maybe you blame your tears on dust in your eye during that cheesy TV commercial; or you sign up for the company fun run, even though you hate running and you know you’ll feel ashamed of how long your body takes to recover.  But even if you grew up displaying your sensitivity with pride, it’s unlikely you escaped the cultural pressure motivating you to disguise your real self to fit the norms. Successful sensitive types respect that their nervous systems are wired differently from 80-85% of people.  If you’re constantly thinking about who you should be but aren’t, and what you should be doing but can’t, understand that valuing your achievements and signature strengths allows you to show yourself as you truly are, more comfortably — even when you’re the odd one out. You probably feel different and alone.  But the truth is, you’re not.  Many have experienced confusion in isolation before discovering that hordes of people have some idea of what it’s like to be you.  They’ve felt the surge of power that comes from being supported by like-minded souls.  And they want to pay it forward. The key whenever possible is to hang out with sensitive people who are already flourishing, or at least open to those possibilities.  They understand not only how to manage their sensitivity, but also how to wield its superpowers.  They know what it’s like for you to feel endlessly under siege, and they can offer firsthand experience and wisdom to help you make your sensitivities work in your favor. Successful sensitive types appreciate and relish the strengths of sensitivity, in themselves and others.  If you’re feeling unsupported or misunderstood, find a sensitively knowledgeable coach, mentor, or community who gets you … and nurture that connection. The brain is a powerful filter that molds experiences and perceptions of reality.  If you think the world is a dangerous place, your brain is wired to hunt for evidence of danger.  If you believe it’s a loving place, you spot more loving opportunities.  What you focus on, you get more of. As a highly sensitive person, the more negative the environment, the more you suffer.  But the opposite is also true — the more positive, the more you thrive (even compared to others). Thoughts are stimuli for your nervous system.  One of the most important things a sensitive person can do is acknowledge the negative (not ignore it — because what you resist, persists), but then let it go… immerse yourself in positive thoughts and situations that make you feel good, or at least give you a soothing sense of relief. Successful sensitive types decide to see the world brimming with opportunities to feel grateful for, and to marinate in that positive vibe.  If you’re feeling at the mercy of your emotions and circumstances, understand that your thoughts (and the emotional charges they trigger) are always within your control. Your gifts of sensitivity include deep reflection and an instinct to see all angles and consequences.  But by being so deeply tuned in to details, you’re easily overwhelmed and exhausted by unyielding stimulation.  And when you don’t understand why you feel and behave in the ways you do, it’s easy to frame these as flaws. In truth, these “weaknesses” are simply your unmet needs and unique gifts to nourish.  In reframing your past and nurturing your present, you set yourself up for success in your future. Successful sensitive types rethink old perceptions in light of their deeper understandings of sensitivity.  If you’re weighed down by the hypersensitive and neglected (even, despised) parts of yourself, seek to discover the other side of the coin … where you’ll find some of your greatest strengths: intuition, vision, conscientiousness — and the list goes on. As a highly sensitive person you are deeply compassionate.  So much so that putting others’ comfort and needs before your own is second nature.  On top of that, you’re often your own biggest critic.  You push yourself hard, and then you beat up on yourself when you miss the mark.  You criticize yourself in ways you’d never dream of judging others. Controlling your nagging inner critic is essential to self-compassion.  But contrary to popular belief, you shouldn’t do so by relentlessly ignoring it.  Deep thinking is one of your gifts, so why not embrace that power?  Take control by hearing your thoughts without judgment (after all, there might be gems of wisdom hidden deep) and then pivoting to thoughts that trigger kinder and more loving emotions in your body.  From that better-feeling place, you’re better able to choose actions to care for yourself and others. Successful sensitive types show themselves the same loving compassion that they’re naturally good at giving others.  It may feel selfish or vain at first, but it’s not.  If your critical inner voice is devaluing who you are, answer back with self-kindness … this is the antidote. We live in a culture that values “take a painkiller and push on” far more than it values sensitivity.  We grow up hearing: “no pain, no gain; survival of the fittest; life isn’t fair — get used to it.”  We admire those who show grit to prevail over their terrible plights. As a highly sensitive person your reflex reaction may be to freeze up or struggle to toughen up.  You build walls to shield yourself from hurt …  Emotional walls, such as suppressing feelings or creating dramatic turmoil to distract from the real causes of pain.  Physical walls, such as piling on layers of weight to hide behind.  Mental walls, such as tuning out with alcohol or drugs. Or, you may let all your boundaries collapse at once, thereby unconsciously absorbing others’ energies and feeling devoured by unpredictable events and emotions.  You try to escape the feelings by getting caught up in overthinking everything: endlessly planning and searching and analyzing, while completely losing touch with your intuition.  And in the process you confuse conscientiousness with overwork, empathy with over-identification, compassion with over-tolerance.  So you beat yourself up about how you know you should have better boundaries.  It’s a vicious cycle. Successful sensitive types embody gentle but firm personal boundaries.  If you struggle to put your own needs first (which doesn’t come naturally to a highly sensitive person), make a conscious choice to practice the skill of saying “no” with love and grace, or carving out alone time to recharge … and decide to feel good about that. Many highly sensitive people learn to ignore the messages their bodies are sending them.  They switch it off to avoid overwhelm or they tune in to others’ needs instead of their own to meet what’s expected of them.  Does this sound familiar? Doing so leaves you swinging like a pendulum.  Too much, too little.  Too fast, too slow.  Too in, too out.  Back and forth between being over-stimulated and mind-numbingly bored, dieting and then bingeing, or exercising hard and then needing several days to recover.  And so on and so forth. Successful sensitive types tune in to the physical sensations in their bodies; they accept that it’s not always comfortable, but they trust their bodies to guide them.  If you have a habit of hiding from feelings or passing the point of overwhelm, learn to recognize your body’s subtle signs of overstimulation.  You’ll spend less time being thrown out of balance, and more time swaying gently within your nervous system’s range of optimal arousal. Eventually, it all catches up with you.  Grueling hours at work, followed by hard sweat at the gym and keeping on top of chaos around home — all fueled by crappy diets and minimal sleep or downtime.  It’s an easy trap to fall into because you’re simply living the way you see most people get by on. What’s more, some seemingly healthy habits hit hard on a sensitive nervous system — like “health” foods that are heavily processed and pumped with sugar and artificial additives, or intense exercise that’s not balanced with ample recovery time.If you allow too much stimulation and too lousy replenishment, you run the risk of chronic illnesses (as many sensitive types have learned the hard way).  At the same time, if you overprotect yourself, your genius goes unexpressed, and that also can lead to stress and ill health. Successful sensitive types practice habits that truly nourish them.  If you struggle with energy or well-being issues, prioritize habits that nurture these areas of your life (such as more sleep and alone time), and limit those that over-stimulate or drain you (such as too many high pressures activities — even if they are so-called healthy). After a lifetime of being bombarded by stimuli, it becomes second nature to push sensitivity out of the conscious awareness.  Tuning out from relentless sensations, for example, so you can pretend you don’t give a darn.  Toning down intense feelings (good and bad) so you aren’t on a roller coaster.  Suppressing emotions to get a break from feeling anything at all. This self-protective mechanism might fool your conscious mind, but it doesn’t fool your sensitive body.  This oozes into your health, your relationships, your career, every aspect of your life … or, it builds tension inside until something has to give. Successful sensitive types let go of the grasp for control.  When you free the energy used to hold yourself tight, you free the gifts of sensitivity that have been lost to you: empathy, creativity, and heightened joy, to name a few.  And you allow your true potential to blossom. As you’re working through the tips above, keep in mind that the key to thriving as a highly sensitive person, more than anything else, is to recognize that it’s perfectly OK to be sensitive — with its challenges and strengths. Use your deep-thinking mind to recognize hidden understandings, and deliberately refocus on positivity and possibilities. Use your deep-feeling body to tune in your emotions and sensations, and stay within your optimal range of arousal as often as possible. Use your heightened awareness to dance to whatever beat you darn well please, even if that seems odd to a lot of people. Because somewhere, others are dancing with you. What are you sensitive about?  What’s something you do that helps you thrive as a sensitive person?  Leave a comment below and share your thoughts and insights. Photo by: Ben Raynal "

Lewis This morning, I received a long email from a reader named Evan who is struggling with letting go of a failed relationship.  In his email he explains, in rather vivid detail, the signs and symptoms of a toxic relationship that has been heading south for many years.  He admits that he needs to let go, but he struggles with it, because doing so means he must finally face reality, which requires him to let go of the idea in his head about how his life and relationship were suppose to be. One particular line from his email really summed it up well: “I’m learning the hard way that the hardest thing in life is simply letting go of what you thought was real.” Isn’t that the truth – for all of us, in all walks of life.  We all have an idea in our heads about how things are, or how they’re supposed to be, and sadly this is what often messes us up and stresses us out the most.  Realize this.  Sometimes life doesn’t give you what you WANT because you NEED something else.  And what you need often comes when you’re not looking for it.  You won’t always understand it and that’s OK.  Just when you think it can’t get any worse, it does.  And then just when you think it can’t get any better, it does. The key is detachment – letting go of the life you expected, so you can make the best of the life that’s waiting for you.  It’s not easy, but it’s worth it.  Here are some strategies for making this happen: Letting go is not giving up.  Letting go is surrendering any obsessive attachment to particular people, outcomes and situations.  Surrender means showing up every day in your life with the intention to be your best self, and to do the best you know how, without expecting life to go a certain way.  Have goals, have dreams, aspire and take purposeful action and build great relationships, but detach from what life must look like. The energy of someone aspiring to create something wonderful, teamed with this kind of surrender, is far more powerful and rewarding than someone determined to create outcomes with a desperate ‘must have’ mentality.  Surrender brings inner peace and joy, and lest we forget that our outer lives are a reflection of our inner state of being. What do you need to let go of?  What thoughts, habits and attachments are creating unnecessary stress in your life?  Leave a comment below and let us know what you intend to do about it.

It’s a variation of this final point that I want to explore further today – seven important life lessons almost everyone learns the hard way, eventually. Someday you will be faced with the reality of loss.  And as life goes on, days rolling into nights, it will become clear that you never really stop missing someone special who’s gone, you just learn to live around the gaping hole of their absence. When you lose someone you can’t imagine living without, your heart breaks wide open, and the bad news is you never completely get over the loss.  You will never forget them.  However, in a backwards way, this is also the good news.  They will live on in the warmth of your broken heart that doesn’t fully heal back up, and you will continue to grow and experience life, even with your wound.  It’s like badly breaking an ankle that never heals perfectly, and that still hurts when you dance, but you dance anyway with a slight limp, and this limp just adds to the depth of your performance and the authenticity of your character. Pursuing happiness is not at all the same as being happy, which is a fleeting feeling dependent on momentary circumstances.  If the sun is shining, by all means bask in it.  Happy times are great and often fun-filled, but happy times pass, because time passes.  This is something we rarely grasp at first. The lifelong pursuit of happiness, on the other hand, is more elusive; it’s not based on a particular outcome.  What you are really pursuing is meaning – living a meaningful life.  It starts with your “why.”  (Why are you doing what you’re doing with your life?)  When your “why” is meaningful, you are pursuing happiness.  There will be times when things go so wrong that you barely feel alive.  And there will also be times when you realize that being barely alive, on your own terms, is better than living a lifeless existence for eighty years on someone else’s terms.  The pursuit isn’t all or nothing; it’s all AND nothing, with ups and downs and worthwhile lessons along the way. In other words, happiness comes most easily when you know what you’re doing, believe in what you’re doing, and love what you’re doing (and who you’re doing it with), regardless of how things turn out.  (Read The Happiness Hypothesis.) Has the fear of rejection held you back?  Have you ever been so fearful of what others might think or say about you that it kept you from taking positive action?  I bet you’re shaking your head, “yes.” It’s time to change your mindset… Today, the only person you should try to be better than is the person you were yesterday.  Prove yourself to yourself, not others.  You are GOOD enough, SMART enough, FINE enough, and STRONG enough.  You don’t need other people to validate you; you are already valuable. If someone says “no” to you, or if someone says something negative about you, that doesn’t change anything about YOU.  The words and opinions of others have no real bearing on your worth.  Certainly it can be helpful and desirable to make a good impression in certain situations, yet it’s not the end of the world when you are faced with rejection. It’s great to receive positive feedback, but it simply doesn’t always happen.  That’s OK though, because you know where you’re headed and you know your true worth does not depend on the judgment of others.  When you set out to make a true difference in life, there will be those who disagree with you, those who ignore you, and those who flat out reject your ideas and efforts.  Look beyond them, step confidently forward, do what must be done, and let them think what they will. When we give in to our fears, we have a harder time looking at ourselves in the mirror.  Sadly, very few of us escape learning this lesson firsthand.  If you have already experienced this a time or two, you know what you need to do. It is only when we risk losing that we truly open the possibility to win.  Whether it is quitting your job to build a business, running a marathon, or traveling to unknown parts of the world, any worthy endeavor requires risk, struggle and sacrifice.  Some of these things may even terrify you, but ask yourself if these fears are stronger than the most powerful of fears, the fear of a wasted life? If you’ve never lost your mind, you’ve never followed your heart.  It’s better to look back on life and say, “I can’t believe I did that,” than to look back and say, “I wish I did that.”  Don’t let time pass you by like a hand waving from a train you desperately want to be on.  Don’t spend the rest of your life thinking about why you didn’t do what you can do right now.  Live your life.  Take risks.  Feel passion.  Discover love.  Run free.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Passion and Growth” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) When you stop predicting and expecting things to be a certain way, you can appreciate them for what they are.  Ultimately you will realize that life’s greatest gifts are rarely wrapped the way you expected. With a positive attitude and an open mind, you will find that life isn’t necessarily any easier or harder than you thought it was going to be; it’s just that “the easy” and “the hard” aren’t exactly the way you had anticipated, and don’t always occur when you expect them to.  This isn’t a bad thing; it makes life interesting. Ninety-nine percent of the time life delivers the experiences that are most helpful for your personal growth.  How do you know it’s the experience you need?  Because it’s the experience you’re having.  The only question is:  Will you embrace it and grow, or fight it and fade? The key, of course, is to accept that not everything is meant to be.  When things don’t turn out how you expected, you have to seriously sit down with yourself and come to grips with the fact that you were wrong about it all along.  It was just an illusion that never really was what you thought it was.  It’s one of the most difficult realizations to accept, to realize that you feel a sense of loss, even though you never really had what you thought you had in the first place. “Don’t think about eating that chocolate donut!”  What are you thinking about now?  Eating that chocolate donut, right?  When you focus on not thinking about something, you end up thinking about it. The same philosophy holds true when it comes to freeing your mind from a negative past experience.  By persistently trying to move away from what you didn’t like and don’t want, you are forced to think about it so much that you end up carrying it’s weight along with you.  But if you instead choose to focus your energy on moving toward something you do like and do want, you naturally leave the negative weight behind as you progress forward. Bottom line:  Running away from your problems is a race you’ll never win.  Move TOWARDS something instead of AWAY.  Rather than trying to eliminate the negative, focus on creating something positive that just happens to replace the negative.   (Read The Road Less Traveled.) Nobody in this world is going to blindside you and hit you as hard as life will.  Sometimes life will beat you to the ground and try to keep you there if you let it.  But it’s not about how hard life can hit you, it’s about how hard you can be hit while continuing to move forward.  That’s what true strength is, and that’s what winning the game of life is all about. When you have a lot to cry and complain about, but you prefer to smile and take a step forward instead, you are growing stronger.  Work through your struggles and hardships.  Even when it feels like things are falling apart, they’re not.  Take control of your emotions before they take control of you.  Everything will fall into place eventually.  Until then, learn what you can, laugh often, live for the moments, and know that it’s all worthwhile in the end. Gandhi once said, “Live as if you were to die tomorrow.  Learn as if you were to live forever.”  I love this quote.  There’s no doubt that every day is a gift, and the gift is an opportunity to live, to learn, and to grow. Be a student of life.  Indulge in it and absorb all the knowledge you can, while you can.  You may have to loose some things to gain some things, and you may have to learn some things the hard way.  That’s OK.  All experiences are necessary.  The purpose of your life is to live it in full, to partake in it to the utmost, to reach out with an open mind and an honest heart for the newest and richest experience being offered. What would you add to this list?  What important life lessons have you learned the hard way?  Leave a comment below and share your thoughts with the community.

"10 Powerful Ideas that Will Change the Way You Work|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-change-work.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| 5 Ways to Stay Mentally Strong When You’re Not Feeling “Good Enough”|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/5-mentally-strong.jpg?resize=500%2C332&ssl=1| “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.”— Eleanor Roosevelt Do you ever feel like you’re not good enough? I bet you do!  I know the feeling.  We all doubt ourselves sometimes – it’s human nature.  And the really crazy thing is, we think everyone else is doing better than us.  But they aren’t. Every day we’re comparing apples with oranges – comparing our insides with other people’s outsides.  That colleague of yours who’s giving a really smooth presentation to the boss, while you wait nervously in your chair until it’s your turn?  She very well might be panicking inside.  You just can’t tell. In fact, if she’s truly great, she likely is panicking inside.  Research suggests that the so-called “impostor syndrome” may get more intense as people get better at what they do: the more accomplished you become, the more likely you are to rub shoulders with ever more talented and skilled people, leaving you feeling even more inadequate by comparison.  So, in a backwards way, if you’re concerned that you don’t measure up, that could very well be a good sign that you actually do measure up just fine. The late and great Maya Angelou, a renowned novelist and poet, once said, “I have written 11 books, but each time, I think ‘Uh-oh.  They’re going to find out now.  I’ve run a game on everybody and they’re going to find me out.”  Angelou was an extraordinary talent, but she was also extraordinary in being willing to admit that she wasn’t always confident about that. And in today’s always-connected world it’s even harder to keep things in perspective.  Our lives are literally unfolding on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat.  We use these social technologies, not surprisingly, to showcase the best parts of our lives: the beautiful weddings and enviable honeymoons, the finished projects, and the best smiles.  But we forget that we’re only seeing everyone else’s highlight reel too – not the sleepless nights, the failed attempts, the moments of grief and self-doubt. So with all of this in mind, if you’re not feeling “good enough” right now, it’s time to adjust your thinking.  Let’s go over five time-tested ways to do just that: It’s not outside forces that make us feel something, it’s what we tell ourselves about what’s happening that creates our feelings.  People’s judgments, life’s unplanned events, and your unchecked to-do lists are not inherently stressful – it’s your thoughts about these things that stress you out. Most of us want to place blame and responsibility on external objects and scenarios because it’s the easy thing to do, but the truth remains that all conflicts start internally, in our minds.  When we flee from responsibility we are doing nothing but harming ourselves and undermining our self-control and self-discipline. The next time you run into an obstacle and feel inner resistance, don’t look at what’s around you.  Instead, look within. Where you are right now is a necessary step. All too often we avoid experiencing exactly where we are because we have developed a belief, based on our ideals or some lie someone once told us, that it is not where we should be or want to be.  But the truth is, where you are right now is exactly where you need to be to get to where you want to go tomorrow. Take a deep breath, take it all in, and take the lessons with you.  (Read The Miracle Morning.) Marcus Aurelius once said, “Does what’s happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforwardness, and all other qualities that allow a person’s nature to fulfill itself?  So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.” Nothing could be closer to the truth. When you least expect it, life sets you up with a challenge to test your courage and willingness to stretch and change; at such a moment, there’s no point in pretending that nothing has happened or in saying that you are not yet ready.  The challenge will not wait.  Life does not look back. Say it out loud: “Today I will do what others won’t, so tomorrow I can do what others can’t.” It will be risky and scary, and yet at the same time, so beautiful.  Because the truth is, it shouldn’t be easy to be amazing.  Then everything would be.  It’s the things you fight for and struggle with before earning that have the greatest worth.  When something is difficult to come by, you’ll do that far more to make sure it’s even harder – if not impossible – to lose. Winston Churchill once said, “Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.”  Know this to be true.  Just because you have faced many defeats in your life, does not mean you have been defeated.  In fact, the exact opposite is true.  A person who makes no mistakes is unlikely to make anything at all.  It’s better to have a lifetime full of small failures that you learned from, rather than a lifetime filled with the regrets of never trying. It’s all about gradually growing stronger and getting better over time. You can spend months or even years on a project, only to watch it be ignored, or even worse, laughed at.  I once worked on a project thinking that it would be a huge success.  I spent a full year on it, and it was my most vulnerable work to date.  When I released it for others to see, nobody liked it, some people laughed at me, and I cried.  That’s what failure feels like when you open up and share an authentic part of yourself.  But recovering from that failure is a practice – a mindset.  In fact, the harsh lessons I internalized from that experience helped me do my most successful work to date. In other words: No failure, no growth.  (Read The 10X Rule.) One thing I’ve learned from the most heart wrenching moments of my life – losing loved ones to illness and accidents – is that death is an unpredictable inevitability.  Embracing this fact provides a sense of urgency, to realize that you’ve lived a certain number of hours, and the hours ahead of you are not as guaranteed as the ones you’ve already lived.  When I think of this I am reminded that every day truly is an opportunity to learn and grow, not in a cliché kind of way, but to honestly appreciate what we are capable of achieving and how we are responsible for the quality of our present lives.  This makes our self-respect, focus, work ethic, generosity, self-awareness, and growth evermore important, right here, right now.  It leaves no time to wallow in self-doubt. The last thing any of us wants to do is die with regret, hence why respecting the reality of death puts life into perspective.  It humbles us and should also deeply motivate us to lead our lives and do our best today: less procrastinating, comparing, criticizing and consuming; more trying, creating, learning and living.  (Angel and I discuss this in detail in the “Adversity” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Sometimes the pressure coming from peers, family, work, and society in general is enough to make us feel completely broken inside.  If we don’t have the “right” job, relationship, lifestyle, and so forth, by a certain age or time frame, we assume we’re just “not good enough.”  Angel and I hear about this kind of self-defeating mindset from our coaching clients (get coaching here) and blog subscribers (subscribe here) on a daily basis, and we aren’t immune either. The tips above will help, but I’d love to learn about your firsthand experience with self-doubt.  Which of the points in this post do you resonate with the most?  What makes you feel “not good enough?”  How have you coped with this negativity?

Last week I interviewed a motel housekeeper in Miami Beach for a side project I’m working on.  “Do you like your job?” I asked.  To my surprise, she smiled from ear to ear and was breathless for a couple seconds.  She finally collected herself and said, “I can’t believe how much I love my job!  I get to make dozens of our guests happy every day and feed my two beautiful children at the same time.”  Talk about a powerful perspective!  Right? A job is only just a job if you chose to see it as a job.  But there’s so much more to it.  All work is a chance to be of service.  All work is a chance to express your gifts and talents.  All work is a chance to be helpful to other people.  All work is a chance to change the world.  It’s up to you to find meaning in your work, whether you’re a house keeper, whether you’re a police officer, whether you’re a teacher, whether you’re an astronaut, or an entrepreneur.  You must find meaning in your work so that every day you feel like you’re on a purposeful mission. So I today challenge you: Love what you do, until you can do what you love.  Love where you are, until you can be where you love.  Love the people you are with, until you can be with the people you love most. This is the way we find happiness.  (Read Buddha’s Brain.) Happy people generally have something known as a “signature strength” – at least one skillset they’ve become proficient at, even if the learning process made them feel somewhat uncomfortable at first. Over the past decade we’ve coached thousands of people online and offline, and one lesson we’ve learned is that, yes, mastering a skill is just as stressful as you might think.  However, this stress is positive.  Although the process of becoming proficient at something takes its toll on people in the form of stress, people also admit that these same activities make them feel happy and satisfied when they look back on their days, weeks, months, and years as a whole.  They see their progress and they feel great about it. Truth be told, being terrible at something is the first step to being truly great at it.  Struggle is the evidence of progress.  The more time you spend there, the faster you learn.  It’s better to spend an extremely high quality ten minutes growing, than it is to spend a mediocre hour running in place.  You want to practice at the point where you are on the edge of your ability, stretching yourself over and over again, making mistakes, stumbling, learning from those mistakes and stretching yourself even farther.  The rewards of becoming great in the long run far outweigh the short-term discomfort that’s felt in the process of earning your stripes. Self-worth that’s attached to external merit can be quite fickle.  For example, through our coaching, Angel and I have come to know that most university students who tie their self-worth to their schooling feel small boosts when they receive a good grade or graduate school acceptance letter, but feel harsh drops in self-worth when they don’t.  What these students are forgetting is that failure is not something you are; it’s just something you experience.  And the same is true for success. So remember that happy, successful people are often happy and successful in the long run for one simple reason: they think about failure and success differently.  They don’t take everything that goes wrong personally, and they don’t get a big head when everything goes right either.  Follow in their footsteps.  Do the best you can, and be a humble, life-long learner.  Never let success get to your head and never let failure get to your heart. Being rushed puts you on the fast track to being miserable.  Period.  But on the flipside, having nothing to do can also take its toll (bad news for those who subscribe to the dream of doing nothing).  The balance is just right when you’re living a productive life at a comfortable pace.  Meaning, you should be expanding your comfort zone often, but not so much that you feel frenzied and out of control.  Easier said than done, but certainly a positive state to strive towards. One method of achieving this is to have “heavy lifting” and “light lifting” timeslots scheduled each day.  During the “heavy lifting” times, you go at it full force, and then as soon as a “light lifting” timeslot arrives, you slow down.  It’s simply a matter of scheduling time every day to not be overly busy.  Have dedicated downtime – clear points in the day to reflect, rest, and recharge.  Don’t fool yourself; you’re not so busy that you can’t afford a few minutes of sanity. Also, keep in mind that you can’t always be agreeable to everyone else’s requests and demands; that’s how people take advantage of you.   Sometimes you have to set clear boundaries.  We all have obligations, but a comfortable pace can only be found by properly managing your yeses.  Be willing to say “No” to most things, so you are able to say “Yes” to the right things.  (Read The ONE Thing.) While giving is usually considered a selfless act, giving is often more beneficial for the giver than the receiver.  In other words, providing social support of any kind can actually be more helpful to the bigger picture of our lives than receiving it.  Intuitively I think we all know this, because it feels amazing to help someone who needs it.  And that’s because lasting happiness doesn’t result from what we get, but from what we give – the experience of making a difference in the world. The science behind this is simple… Performing any act of kindness releases Serotonin in your brain.  Serotonin is a natural substance that has incredible health benefits, including making you feel more joyful.  However, what’s even cooler about this is that not only will you feel better, but so will others watching your act of kindness transpire.  That’s right; bystanders will be blessed with a release of Serotonin just by watching you give kindness.  (And a side note is that the job of most anti-depressants is to release more Serotonin.  Move over Pfizer, kindness is kicking butt and taking names!) So just keep in mind that while you can’t give all of yourself all of the time, you can give some of yourself some of the time, and doing so will make all the difference. Finding Flow, an interesting psychology book on happiness, reveals national survey data showing that when someone claims to have a few close friends with whom they can discuss important problems, they are 60% more likely to say they’re happy.  Also, did you know studies have shown that average human mortality rates DOUBLE when we’re lonely?  WHOA! Good relationships really are worth their weight in gold.  And the number of friends isn’t the important aspect here; it’s the effort you put into your relationships that matters.  Although it’s harsh to think about, even the best relationships dissolve over time if they aren’t maintained; a closeness with someone is something you need to continually earn, so never treat it as a given.  Every time you connect with those close to you, you further strengthen those bonds and you give yourself a little boost of happiness at the same time.  Win-win. And don’t wait around to make big plans with those you care about.  Make your time together the plan.  Communicate openly on a regular basis.  Get together in the flesh as often as possible.  Not because it’s convenient to do so, but because you know each other are worth the extra effort. Just put down the smart phone, close the laptop and enjoy each other’s company, face to face, the old fashioned way.  There are few joys in life that equal a good conversation, a genuine laugh, a long walk, a friendly dance, or a big hug shared by two people who care about each other.  Sometimes the most ordinary things can be made extraordinary just by doing them with the right people.  So choose to be around these people, and choose to make the most of your time together.  (Angel and I discuss this in detail in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) This one is more anecdotal than specific, but perhaps the most important point of them all. When the Guardian asked a hospice nurse about the most common regrets of the dying, one of the prevalent answers was that people regretted not being true to themselves.  As one patient put it, “I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.” May that quote dwell in your mind and remind you to make your needs a priority. Because ultimately, no matter how you live or how wonderful you are, someone else will be disappointed.  So do your thing.  Don’t hesitate and waste all your time with lots of explanations.  Most people only hear what they want to hear anyway.  Just because someone doesn’t understand your point of view, doesn’t mean a great explanation doesn’t exist. Seriously, can you remember who you were before the world told you who you should be?  Happiness is found when you stop comparing yourself to everyone else and what they want.  Stop living for other people and their opinions.  Be true to yourself.  You are the only person in charge of your life.  The only question is: What do you want to do with the rest of it? Start doing it! As they say, there are seven days in the week, and “someday” isn’t one of them. How about you?  What habits keep you happy?  What else would you add to the list?

Photo by: Aurora Martin 8 Toxic Beliefs Most People Think Are Normal|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/8-toxic-beliefs.jpg?resize=500%2C485&ssl=1| 4 Unconventional Steps Extremely Successful People Take in Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/4-successful-people.jpg?resize=500%2C364&ssl=1| All your dreams can come true if you have the courage to pursue them.  And the way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.  Over the years, Angel and I have had the privilege of working with dozens of extremely successful people.  The key thing that separates them from the crowd is their unwavering self-discipline to actually get the right things done. I’m betting you have stuff you want to do — stuff you know you should be doing.  But it doesn’t get done.  Why?  You need to go from dreaming to doing… but it’s difficult to get going. You want to excel more at work, get better grades, learn a new skill, get those six-pack abs, or spend more quality time with your family… but it’s not happening.  Instead you just procrastinate. So what can help get you going when you’re not motivated to achieve your longer-term goals?  What’s the secret? Angel and I have observed a simple four-step process repeated consistently in the habits and routines of the most successful people we know. The first step, believe it or not, is dreaming.  We’re all pretty good at that — but it’s only part of the process.  In fact, if you do it wrong it can actually make things worse.  Here’s how to do it right… Everything starts with a dream.  But if that’s all you do, you’re in serious trouble. Also, having a positive attitude is an explicit requirement, because a negative attitude makes us more likely to quit — or to never even begin in the first place. But when that positive attitude becomes a constant habit of fantasizing, things go south really quick.  Yes, that’s right, tirelessly dreaming about success is not constructive. Again and again (somewhat to our surprise at first), our course members and coaching clients have had the same negative outcomes from over-fantasizing about what they want.  Big fantasies, wishes and dreams detached from real life experience (action) never translates into the necessary motivation to create a more energized, engaged life.  It translates into the opposite — more procrastination. Why?  The inexperienced, emotional human brain just can’t tell the difference between fantasy and reality. When you fantasize, certain parts of your brain think you’ve actually achieved your goal.  So rather than ramping up, motivation actually pulls back.  From what we’ve experienced through coaching thousands of people over the past decade, the main reason positive fantasies often predict poor achievement is because they do not actually generate enough energy to pursue the desired outcome.  They don’t get people out of their chairs! Too much dreaming turns positive thinking into mere wishful thinking. So if it doesn’t work, why in the world do we do it so often?  Plain and simple: it feels good. Just like stuffing your face with chocolate cake or checking your email for the 70th time today, it feels good in the moment — but is counterproductive to long-term success. Constant dreaming about success in the future seems to protect our egos against sadness in the short-term, but then promotes sadness over the long-term if that’s all we do.  Because lofty expectations are being built but aren’t being backed by any substantial means to get from point A to point B. Want to lose weight?  Those who merely dream of looking thinner often lose significantly less weight than those who envision themselves gaining weight if they don’t take deliberate and immediate action. Want to meet that special someone?  The more frequently our course members and coaching clients have admitted to indulging in positive fantasies, the less likely they reported initiating a real relationship. Okay, you get the idea.  Dreaming by itself leads to nowhere worthwhile.  So, what are the missing steps? This part isn’t too difficult.  You just need to take your dream and crystalize it.  Be ultra-specific. So if “making more money” is your dream, your desired outcome might be “get a raise at my next annual performance review.” Dreaming of a better work-life balance?  Your outcome could be “A daily work schedule that allows me to be free every afternoon at 4 P.M. sharp and off during weekends.” (For more on setting goals and actually achieving them, check out Getting Back to Happy.) So your dream is now clear.  But this is when things get trickier and a bit more unconventional.  It’s time to be constructively negative… We call this “mental contrasting.”  You need to consciously think about the obstacles that could potentially prevent you from achieving your desired outcome. This might seem counterintuitive at first, but it’s a strategy that works wonders.  And here’s what’s really interesting: As we’ve used this method in our coaching practice over the years, some people who do this get more focused almost instantly, while others end up less motivated in the short-term. Does that mean this strategy is defective?  No, it means it’s truly working.  Here’s why: The people who do not get a boost of focus are often the ones who realize the “specific outcome” they are aiming for is not specific enough or simply not reasonable – meaning they’re aiming for a goal too big and overwhelming for their current mindset. So this mental contrasting doesn’t only motivate people to get the right things done, it also helps them break their bigger long-term goals into achievable shorter-term goals that they can wrap their minds around and get excited about, right now.  So… The latter are deterred from dreaming the wrong dream again and again, and so they tighten up their focus and don’t waste any more of their time.  Thus, outcomes for both groups that use mental contrasting are positive. The bottom line is that to be successful, we have to envision what could go wrong, and what will inevitably go wrong, in advance, before we begin.  Far too many ambitious people fail for easily preventable reasons.  Far too many people don’t have a well-thought-out backup plan because they refuse to consider something might not go exactly as they dreamed it would. Today, this strategy not only helps entrepreneurs close billion dollar business deals, it saves lives.  Prior to my career in personal development and life coaching, I spent a decade working for the U.S. Marine Corps.  One thing I learned from the high-ranking officers I worked for: They spend a vast majority of their mission training time going over every possible mistake or catastrophe that could happen during the mission.  Every possible error is mercilessly examined and linked to a suitable reaction: If the aircraft is hit and losing altitude, we’ll do X.  If we are forced to make an emergency landing in enemy territory, we’ll do Y.  If we are outnumbered on the ground, we’ll do Z. (For more on using “obstacle visualization” to improve decision-making, read Decisive: How to Make Better Choices.) So now you know your obstacles and you’re ready to take the next step… Mental contrasting is so helpful because it directly weighs dreams against realities.  It basically stress-tests your desired outcomes.  In other words, questioning your dreams leads to insights about how to proceed with them in the real world. The bottom line is that while thinking positive is important, it’s also important to ask questions that help you actually build a plan for making real progress. So rather than just saying something positive like, “I will lose weight,” start with a question like “Can I lose weight?” (and this question leads to other obvious questions, like “How?”) Seems like a small difference, but questions are powerful tools.  They make you realistically consider the problem and what’s truly required.  From my experience, those who use this kind of self-inquiry for goal setting always outperform those who employ the more conventional positive affirmation sort of self-talk. Questioning your dreams helps build actionable plans.  And actionable plans help you be more productive, and eventually bring your dreams to reality. So what’s the best way to make sure your actionable plan addresses your obstacles? Create little “if-then” responses to all the (known) challenges you face. For instance, a simplified bit of self-inquiry might go something like this: Makes sense, doesn’t it?  Simple, but a little different. Successful people are successful because they take action.  They are taking action right now.  And YOU can be one of them. So take the four steps above and start working through them.  Yes, right now!  Reading is not doing! Just like watching Shark Tank doesn’t make you an entrepreneur, reading about what successful people do doesn’t make you a success unless you follow in their footsteps. You want to go from dreamer to do-er?  Try it now: And then take action! Can you see how this strategy takes a simple dream and puts you on a path to achieving it?  I’m hoping you’re nodding your head up and down. But again, blog posts can’t change your life.  Only YOU can.  Now go DO IT! I’ll help start you off… Tell me: What do you dream of achieving?  What are you going to do about it today?

"12 Rules for Being Beautifully Human|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/12-beautifully-human.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| “There is some kind of a sweet innocence in being human – in not having to be just happy or just sad – in the nature of being able to be both broken and whole, at the same time.”— C. JoyBell C. Be present, let go of the past, don’t beat yourself up over what you did yesterday, and don’t try to be perfect.  Just be a beautiful example of being human… No matter what’s happening, anyone can efficiently fight the battles of just one day.  It’s only when you add the battles of those two abysmal eternities, yesterday and tomorrow, that life gets overwhelmingly complicated.  Realize that it’s not the experience of today that holds you back and drives you crazy, but the regret and resentment about something that happened yesterday or the fear and dread of what tomorrow might bring.  It’s necessary, therefore, to let yourself live just one day at a time – just today – just right here, right now. Bad things happen every day and to everyone at some point.  The difference is in how people deal with it.  So smile, let others know there is still hope.  Be patient and tough, someday this pain will be useful to you.  Those with the strength to succeed in the long run are the ones who lay a firm foundation of growth with the bricks that life has thrown at them.  So don’t be afraid to fall apart for a little while, because when it happens, the situation will open an opportunity for you to grow and rebuild yourself into the brilliant person you are capable of being. Hard times are often blessings in disguise.  Let go and let life strengthen you.  No matter how much it hurts, hold your head up and keep going.  This is an important lesson to remember when you’re having a rough day, a bad month, or a crappy year.  Things will unquestionably change – you will not feel this way forever. Truth be told, sometimes the hardest lessons to learn are the ones your spirit needs most.  Your past was never a mistake if you learned from it.  So take all the crazy experiences and lessons and place them in a box labeled “Thank You.”  You simply can’t feel real happy unless you’ve felt heartache.  You can’t have a sense of victory unless you know what it means to fail.  You can’t know what it’s like to feel whole until you know what it’s like to feel completely shattered.  And you can’t be rebirthed until you’ve passed on from who you used to be.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Adversity” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) There will be a distinct few times in your life when all your instincts will tell you to do something – something that defies logic, upsets your plans, and seems completely crazy to others.  When this happens, sit quietly and listen to your intuition.  Let your instincts take over and ignore everything else.  Ignore what you’re “supposed” to do, ignore the odds, ignore what everyone else wants you to do, and just go for it. In life, if you don’t risk anything, you risk everything.  And you can’t always wait for the perfect time.  Sometimes you must dare to jump.  Sometimes all you need is twenty seconds of insane courage – just literally twenty seconds of uncomfortable bravery – and I promise you, something great will come of it. Constantly checking your life against one of society’s prewritten stories of how things “should” be is a phony way of living.  It’s sort of like renting your identity.  Just be you.  You are far more nuanced than anyone else’s narrative you try to fit yourself into, and more complex than society’s story of what “should” be happening. The problem is that when you think you have to “look” for things in life like love, meaning, and inspiration, the “looking” implies that these things are somehow hiding behind some bushes somewhere, just waiting to be discovered.  So you start asking yourself questions that lead you further and further outside yourself, which is not where the answers you seek live. In life you have to create your own love, define your own meaning, and harbor your own inspiration.  This process starts on the inside, not somewhere else.  Much of this can be accomplished simply by asking yourself the right questions.  Start with these: The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don’t have any.  In a world filled with doubt, you must dare to dream.  In a world filled with anger, you must dare to forgive.  In a world filled with hate, you must dare to love.  In a world filled with distrust, you must dare to believe.  And once you do, you will find that power you once thought you lacked. Never let anyone steal your dreams.  Stay optimistic and focused.  Being positive when negativity surrounds you is not naive, it’s leadership.  Work hard in silence, do what you have to do, and ignore the drama and negativity surrounding you.  Let your success be your noise.  (Read Start: Punch Fear in the Face.) Beware of quick-fix solutions that simply worsen the problems they promise to solve.  Obviously there’s nothing to be gained from a cure that’s worse than the disease.  And there’s certainly nothing to be gained from a solution that merely masks or delays a problem without addressing its underlying cause.  When there’s a real problem in your life, expect to do some real work. Facing a challenge requires effort, and yet that effort is necessary only for a relatively short time.  Running from the challenge requires ever-increasing effort that has no end.  Truly eliminating the cause of the problem does indeed take more work than quickly fixing the symptoms.  Yet once the difficult work is done to remove the problem, it’s gone for good.  Do the required work to root out each problem at its core, and your efforts will always bring lasting returns. Life is “give and take.” Give thanks and take nothing for granted.  Being happy doesn’t mean you have it all, it means you appreciate it all.  So stop worrying and complaining all the time.  Life is too short.  Instead of focusing on how stressed you are, remember how blessed you are. You’re blessed more than you likely realize.  You have what many hope for. The people and things you take for granted today may be the only ones you need tomorrow.  Never be too busy to make time for that which matters most.  Remember the good times, be strong during tough times, love always, laugh often, live honestly, and be thankful for each new day.  Happiness never comes to those who don’t appreciate what they have.  So be thankful today.  Life isn’t perfect, it’s just pretty darn good. Don’t hide your thoughts and feelings, especially when you can make a difference.  Be brave.  Speak your truth.  There is no greater sadness than holding on to the honest words you never had the courage to speak.  Say what needs to be said.  Hiding how you really feel and trying to make everyone happy doesn’t make you nice, it just makes you a liar.  You have to tell the truth, or eventually someone will tell it for you.  Living a life of honesty creates peace of mind, and peace of mind is priceless.  Period. Bottom line:  Never be dishonest and never put up with people who are. The more you judge, the less you see and love.  Be compassionate and kinder than necessary, for everyone you meet is fighting some kind of battle.  Everyone has a story hidden inside them that is equally as complex as your own; try to understand that people are not always as they seem.  Be patient with them.  Pay attention. Everyone you meet has something important to teach you that may change your life.  In fact, many of your greatest accomplishments in life will come when you are able to bless someone else while you are going through your own storm.  So regardless of what’s going on in your life, be gentle and kind.  Think before you speak and act.  Always remember that the words and actions you choose can only be forgiven, not forgotten.  You were made to make a difference, so embrace every opportunity to do so.  No act of your kindness, no matter how tiny, will ever be wasted. Sooner or later, you just want to be around the people who make you smile.  So every chance you get, spend time with those who help you love yourself more.  One true friend in life who understands your tears and troubles is far more valuable than a hundred friends who only show up for your smiles and joys.  Because a true friend accepts who you truly are, and also helps you become who you are capable of being. Relationships like this require more than just finding the right person, they also require you to be the right person.  So when someone believes in you enough to lift you up, try not to let them down.  Actions often speak much louder than words.  When you care about someone you have to act accordingly.  They will be able to tell how you feel about them simply by the way you treat them over the long-term.  (Read The 5 Love Languages.) Life is often unpredictable.  Some of the greatest moments in your life won’t necessarily be the things you do; they’ll be things that happen to you.  That doesn’t mean you can’t take action to affect the outcome of your life.  You have to take action, and you will.  But don’t forget that on any day, you can step out the front door and your whole life can change in an instant – for better or worse. To an extent, the universe has a plan that’s always in motion.  A baby bird flaps its wings and it starts to hail – it’s a scary thought, but it happens and it’s part of life’s cycle.  All these little components of Mother Nature, constantly working – sometimes forcing you to struggle, and sometimes making sure you end up exactly in the right place at the right time. Which of the points above do you intend to work on this year?  What else would you add to the list?  I would love to hear from you in the comments below. Photo by: Nattu 10 Ways to Stop Treating Yourself|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-stop-treating.jpg?resize=500%2C281&ssl=1| “The only person who can pull me down is myself, andI’m not going to let myself pull me down anymore.”?C. JoyBell C. Your relationship with yourself is the closest and most important relationship you will ever have.  When was the last time someone told you they loved and respected you just the way you are, and that what you think and how you feel means the world?  When was the last time someone told you that you did a great job, or when necessary, that “everything is going to be OK.”  When was the last time that ‘someone’ was YOU? It’s time to start treating yourself better.  It’s time to… Sadly, only a tiny percentage of the people in this world will actually experience their lives today.  So many of us will be stuck on another day, another time and place that troubled us and caused us to spiritually stumble, and thus miss out on life as we’re living it.  Realize this and pull it together.  Do not allow your spirit to be softened or your happiness to be limited by a time and place you cannot get back or a day that does not yet exist.  Live today! Before you know it you’ll be asking, “How did it get so late so soon?”  So take time right now to figure yourself out.  Take time to realize what you want and need.  Take time to take risks.  Take time to love, laugh, cry, learn, and move forward.  Life is shorter than it often seems.  Realize that right now you’re lucky because you still have a chance.  So stop for a moment and think.  Whatever you need to do, start doing it now; there are only so many ‘todays’ left. Remember that there is a place within you that you can go to at any moment.  It is calm and full of love.  Forget about the noise your mind is reciting to you.  It is stuck, and it is wrong.  Look within.  Go there when you are sad.  Go there when you are fearful or angry or troubled.  Go there when you are alone in your car in hectic traffic, or when you are surrounded by people who intimidate you.  And don’t forget to go there when you are happy too. Forget what you “know.”  You are not your body.  You are not your past or future.  You are not what others expect of you.  The essence of your being is love and it is within you right now.  Your spirit is simply waiting for you to remember this.  So go to that place in the center of you.  Let the deep love and serenity swallow you whole.  Everything is always okay, even when it’s not.  Let go of the mind’s need to remind you of everything that weighs you down.  You are none of that.  You are at peace.  Now breathe, again, and smile.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Ever feel totally out of your element?  Like you’re due to be discovered for the “fraud” that you are?  This is what psychologists call the “impostor syndrome” – where you constantly feel like everyone around you has their act together, but you don’t.  And the more others recognize your achievements, the more you feel like a fake.  Enhance your knowledge, and as you expand the scope of what you know, you’ll inevitably be exposed to more and more of what you don’t, and thus you’ll subconsciously discredit everything you do know. Impostorism is, for many of us, a natural symptom of gaining expertise.  Move up the ranks, and if your line of work is even vaguely based on a totem pole of individual achievement, you’ll encounter more talented people to compare yourself negatively against.  It never stops.  I’ve written hundreds of self-improvement articles that have received millions of page views and social media shares, and praise from a dedicated community of readers, but each time I write a new post I think, “Oh boy, this time they’re going to find me out,” as if I’m some low-profile underachiever who doesn’t deserve to be writing and inspiring others. The solution is to talk it out with a trusted friend or partner.  Talk about your insecurities more, and let them do the same.  Admittedly, it’s a hard conversation to initiate, so in the mean time just remember that everyone feels like an impostor sometimes – it’s not just you. One of the hardest lessons in life is letting go.  Whether it’s feelings of guilt, anger, disappointment, loss or betrayal.  Change is never easy.  We fight to hold and we fight to let go.  But we must eventually let GO.  There’s no point in stressing over what you can’t change.  Stop over-thinking everything.  Let it be, move on, and grow from the experience. It’s often our own thinking that hurts us.  There’s no reason to imprison yourself.  Don’t think outside the box; think like there is no box.  And never regret your past mistakes, because they gave you strength.  The one who falls and gets up is much stronger than the one who never fell.  Sometimes you have to accept the fact that things will never go back to how they used to be, and that this ending is really a new beginning.  (Read The Untethered Soul.) Your inner light is seen.  Your heart is heard.  Your spirit is treasured by more people than you imagine.  If you knew how many others have been touched in profound ways by you, you would be astounded.  If you knew how many people feel so much for you, you would be speechless.  You are far more brilliant than you think you are.  Rest with that.  Rest easy with that.  Breathe in and out, and again.  You are doing fine.  More than fine.  Better than fine.  You’re doing great.  So relax.  And love yourself today. Stop discrediting yourself for everything you aren’t, and start giving yourself credit for everything that you are.  Behind you is infinite power, before you is endless possibility, around you is boundless opportunity.  So what are you going to do today? No, you won’t always get exactly what you want.  But remember this: There are lots of people who will never have what you have right now.  Remember, the happiest people don’t necessarily HAVE the best of everything, but they always try to MAKE the best of everything they have. Good or bad, just smile.  You have a lot to be thankful for.  Never forget it.  Don’t be negative when you have so much to be positive about.  Your mind is a powerful thing.  Weakness in thinking becomes weakness in living.  When you fill your mind with positivity, you grow stronger.  Be wise enough to walk away from the nonsense around you.  Focus on the positives, and soon the negatives will be harder to see. We all have this idea in our heads of how things are supposed to be, but sadly this is why we end up disappointed.  Expect less.  Enjoy more.  Sometimes life doesn’t give you what you WANT because you NEED something else.  And what you need often comes when you’re not looking for it. Bottom line:  Don’t hold yourself down with things you can’t control.  There’s a time and place for everything.  Don’t force what’s not yet supposed to fit into your life.  When it’s meant to be, it will be.  (Read Buddha’s Brain.) You can’t live a positive life around negative people 24/7.  Ignore these people and move on from them when you must.  Seriously, be strong and know when enough is enough!  Distancing yourself from negative people doesn’t mean you hate them, or that you wish them harm; it just means you care about your own well-being.  Because every time you subtract negative from your life, you make room for more positive. If you allow people to make more withdrawals than deposits in your life, you will be out of balance and in the negative.  Know when to close the account.  In the end, life is too short to argue and fight.  Count your blessings, value the people who matter, and move on from the drama with your head held high. Are you doing what you’re doing out of fear, or love?  Think about it. Every human thought, word and deed is based on fear or love.  Fear is an inner energy that contracts, closes down, draws in, hides, hoards and harms.  When you live through fear, you pull back from life.  Love, on the other hand, is an inner energy that expands, opens up, sends out, reveals, shares and heals.  When you live through love, you open to all that life has to offer with presence and acceptance. Love is risky.  Love is unsafe.  Love isn’t for the faint of heart.  Love takes courage.  And most importantly, love and fear can’t coexist.  Love means giving life the opportunity to break your heart, but knowing that there are far better things ahead than anything you’ve left behind. As Abraham Lincoln so profoundly said, “We are just about as happy as we make up our minds to be.” Happiness is the result of personal choice and effort.  You fight for happiness, strive for it, switch careers, build relationships, and sometimes even reinvent your lifestyle entirely as you uncover it.  Why?  Because you have to actively participate in the manifestations of your own joys and good fortunes – they are not ready-made for the taking; they are available for the making. Ironically, a big part of this is simply doing your very best and then letting go and trusting that things will work out the way they’re supposed to, without trying to control every little detail of the outcome.  Instead of expecting to always get what you want, you appreciate the journey enough to want what you get.  The joy of the freedom this brings gradually becomes more pleasurable than the outcome itself. In what way have you been mistreating yourself?  What do you need to start doing for yourself instead?  I would love to hear from you in the comments below.

"50 Happiness Quotes to Change the Way You Think|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/50-happiness-quotes-think.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1|Click or tap on a book to check it out:     Sometimes it’s excruciatingly hard to get back up again.  This is how Marc and I felt just over a decade ago when we were knocked down and stuck in a rut after simultaneously losing two loved ones to suicide and illness.  It was nearly impossible to move when we didn’t feel we had the strength to push forward. But, we found a way. We pushed ourselves as hard as we could to take one tiny step every day—one journal entry, one 10-minute workout, one honest conversation, and so forth.  It wasn’t easy, but the tiny steps were manageable and we gradually grew stronger.  And believe it or not, that’s basically what I did again this morning.  I was desperately struggling to motivate myself for the past few days after a significant business opportunity fell through.  I was feeling utterly defeated.  So, I took the tiniest possible step.  Just turning on my laptop, opening up the word processing application, and writing a single sentence.  Such an action is so small as to seem insignificant, and yet so easy as to be possible when I was feeling desperate and defeated again this morning.  And it showed me that the next step was possible, and the next.  And the end result is the couple paragraphs you’ve just finished reading. Why am I telling you this? Because I know we all need a healthy reminder sometimes… to do the hard things we need to do to be happy.  The things that frighten us.  The things others can’t do for us.  The things that make the difference between existing and living—between knowing the path and walking the path—between a life of empty promises and defeat and one filled with renewed happiness, possibility and peace. And, along these lines, I have some great news: Marc and I wrote three bestselling books (one of them is a New York Times bestseller) to guide us—all of us—through that necessary journey of doing the hard things.  I sincerely wish I could have read these books over a decade ago.  In many ways, it would have saved me from myself.  It absolutely would have saved me from intense periods of darkness that were born primarily from my subconscious attempt to take the easy way out of the painful realities I faced. Watch what happened when Marc and I stepped into the Today Show studio recently to discuss the painful personal journey that inspired us to write…  The books are available to order together right now.  If you decide to order today, send me an email at [email protected] with your receipt information (just copy and paste or screenshot the finalized order details from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Audible, or wherever you choose to order the book.).  We’ve prepared a great digital bonus for you: a 30-point “daily reminders” book (I guarantee you’ll find immense value in this bonus). Also, watch the official Getting Back to Happy book trailer:  And yes, the new book shares the title of our renowned Getting Back to Happy course, but understandably, the book and the course are completely different educational tools. For example, our course is video based, includes live one-on-one Skype/FaceTime coaching with Marc and me, and has an active online support community. The Getting Back to Happy book is a smaller, self-paced resource you can hold in your hands and take with you wherever you go… something you can turn to in real time, offline, as you need it. Both tools—the course and the book—complement each other very well, but they are standalone. In the book, you will face the truth right from the get-go… You are not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or a week ago.  You are always growing.  Experiences don’t stop.  That’s life.  And the very experiences that seem so tough when you are going through them are the ones you will look back on with gratitude for how far you have come.  Of course, it takes practice to get there, emotionally and physically, and that’s why we wrote this for YOU. The goal of the book is not to get rid of all your negative thoughts, feelings and life situations.  That is impossible.  The goal is to change your response to them. Again, Getting Back to Happy is the book I wish Marc and I had when life’s biggest challenges came our way.  Filled with actionable steps for bouncing back from tough times and getting back on the road to happiness and success, this is a book to spark sustainable action—and to return to whenever needed.  Sharing never-before-published stories and strategies, the book shows how to harness the power of daily rituals, mindfulness, self-care, and more to shift our perspective—and our actions—in order to become our happiest and most effective selves. Order Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs today (and don’t forget to email me your receipt details, so we can send you the bonus books once they’re ready). And of course, if there’s anything else Marc and I can do to assist you, please don’t hesitate to email me ([email protected]). Sincerely hoping you’re looking forward to an inspired next step, Angel Chernoff(and Marc, too)🙂 9 Things You Need to Stop Caring About|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/9-better-off.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| “Often, it’s not about becoming a new person, but becoming the person you were meant to be, and already are, but don’t know how to be.”— Heath L. Buckmaster About a decade ago, when I told my grandmother that I was worried about making a significant life change and then regretting my choice, she said, “Do you know what my biggest regret is?  Not taking more chances and making necessary changes when I was your age.”  Her words have been stuck in the back of my mind ever since, and they have helped me make many positive choices in life.  This is especially true whenever I bump up against the reality that something in my life isn’t working, and that it’s perhaps time to make some changes. If you are currently facing a similar reality, ask yourself this:  “What am I focusing on that isn’t working?” A big part of your life is the result of what you choose to focus on.  If you don’t like something, it’s time to choose differently.  Don’t be afraid to let go of your old ways and start over today.  It’s a brand new opportunity to rebuild what you truly want. Here are nine things I have addressed and purged in my own life – some common emotional traps we are all better off NOT caring about: You don’t have to be defined by the things you did or didn’t do in the past.  Don’t let yourself be controlled by regret.  Maybe there’s something you could have done differently, or maybe not.  Either way, it’s merely something that has already happened. Cleanse your heart of these regrets every night.  Just as your body needs regular washing because it gets dirty every day, so does your heart.  Because every day people may hurt you, offend you, forget you, snub you, step on you, or reject you.  But if you choose to forgive these people and let these things go before you go to sleep, you cleanse your heart.  You wake up the next morning refreshed and free of negativity.  Refuse to carry old regrets, mindsets and distractions into each new day. In life you always have one of two things, either you have the thing you are capable of achieving, or the reasons why you don’t.  Laziness may appear attractive, but dedication and work leads to fulfillment and happiness in the long run.  If you really want to do something, you’ll find a way; if you don’t, you’ll find an excuse. Truthfully, almost anything is possible if you’ve got enough time and enough nerve.  What you need to remember is that you can’t always wait for the perfect time and conditions, because there may be no such thing.  Most of the time you must simply dare to jump. And don’t say you don’t have enough time.  You have exactly the same number of hours per day that were given to Helen Keller, Pasteur, Michaelangelo, Mother Teresea, Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Jefferson, Albert Einstein, etc…  (Read Flourish.) You will NEVER have enough time, enough resources, or enough money to do the perfect thing.  But what’s truly amazing is what you can achieve without “enough” of these supposed requirements.  Sooner or later you will come to realize that it’s not what you are missing that counts; it’s what you do with what you have. To be upset about what you don’t have is always a waste of what you do have.  The happiest and most successful people aren’t the luckiest, and they usually don’t have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes their way.  The reason so many people give up is because they tend to look at what’s missing, and how far they still have to go, instead of what’s present, and how far they have come. To play it too safe is one of the riskiest choices you can make.  By leaving your comfort zone behind and taking a leap of faith into something new, you find out who you are truly capable of becoming.  Obstacles are put in your way to help you determine if what you want is really worth fighting for. Remember, the strongest people are the ones who feel pain and discomfort, accept it, fight through it, and learn from it.  They turn their wounds into wisdom and growth. If you are too afraid of failure, you can’t possibly do what needs to be done to be successful.  Your desire to succeed must overpower your fear of failure. Accept what is, let go of what was, and have faith in what could be.  Just keep going and keep thinking, “I may not be there yet, but I’m closer than I was yesterday!”  Inevitably, you will make lots of mistakes and you will feel plenty of pain, but in life, mistakes make you smarter and pain makes you stronger. Bottom line:  Don’t worry about mistakes too much, because some of the most beautiful things we create in life come from changes we make after failures. Give, but don’t get used.  Never waste too much of your time on someone who doesn’t value it. A good relationship doesn’t drag you down, it lifts you up.  Listen to positive people and ignore negative ones.  People that doubt, judge and disrespect you are not worth your time and attention.  Life gets easier when you delete the people that make it difficult.  All failed relationships hurt, but losing someone who doesn’t appreciate and respect you is actually a gain, not a loss. Being alone in the long run is far better than being with someone who doesn’t appreciate your worth.  Know your worth.  Know the difference between what you’re getting and what you deserve.  There comes a time when you have to stop crossing oceans for the people who won’t even jump a puddle for you.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Most of the time the people who want more than they need end up losing everything altogether.  Greed and selfishness will get you nowhere in life.  The happiest, most successful people are looking for ways to help others.  The unhappiest, most unsuccessful people are still asking, “What’s in it for me?” A life filled with loving deeds and good character is the best tombstone.  Those who you inspired and shared your love and compassion with will remember how you made them feel long after your time has expired.  So carve your name on hearts, not stone.  What you have done for yourself alone dies with you; what you have done for others and the world remains. It’s impossible to know exactly how another person is feeling or what kind of emotional battles they’re fighting.  Sometimes the widest smiles hide the thinnest strands of self-confidence and hope.  Sometimes the ‘rich’ have everything but happiness.  Realize this as you interact with others, long before you pass judgment.  Every smile or sign of strength hides an inner struggle every bit as complex and extraordinary as your own. It’s a sage fact of life, really, that every one of us encompasses a profound and unique set of secrets and mysteries that are absolutely undetectable to everyone else.  So smile at people who look like they are having a rough day today.  Be kind to them.  Kindness is the only investment that never fails. Fulfillment is not a matter of achieving a specific goal; it is a matter of mindfully enjoying the process required to achieve that goal.  Fulfillment flows from focusing your life around specific and authentically held intentions – ideas and activities that genuinely speak to your purpose.  When these intentions are clear, consistent and meaningful, you have sufficient means to bring fulfillment and joy to your life, whether you ever fully achieve your intended goal or not. In other words, it’s the process of following your path that’s important, not the speed at which you progress down it.  Happiness is found during the journey, not at the destination.  Slow down so you can appreciate the forest for each of its trees.  You have a better chance of truly seeing where you are when you stop spending every waking moment trying to get somewhere else. Take the time to celebrate the goodness surrounding you and how far you’ve come, rather than focusing exclusively of what’s still left to be done.  (Read Learned Optimism.) Do you hold too tight to your comfort zone?  Do you judge yourself and others unfairly?  Do you let someone constantly suck the happiness out of you?  You know which of the points above apply to you.  Pick one and focus on improving in that area every day for the next 30 days. So which of the points above are you struggling with most right now?  What else would you add to the list?  Please leave a comment below and share your thoughts and insights with us. Photo by: Martin Fisch 10 Things You Should Never Say About Yourself|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-never-about-yourself.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| “None but ourselves can free our minds.”— Bob Marley When I was a freshman in high school, and struggling to find my way, someone anonymously slipped a note into my locker one afternoon.  It said, “Don’t let them get inside your head.  You’re not boring, nerdy or weird.  You’re complex, creative and far too intelligent for their small words.  And for the record, you are also infinitely more attractive than you give yourself credit for.” I never discovered who wrote the note, but whoever they are, they changed my life.  From that day forward, I changed the way I talked to myself. Specifically, I STOPPED saying… You might think you’re not good enough, but you’ll surprise yourself if you keep trying.  Your past does not determine who you are. Your past prepares you for who you are capable of becoming.  What ultimately defines you is how well you rise after falling.  Don’t ever be afraid to give yourself a chance to be everything you are capable of being.  Forget the haters.  Never undervalue who you are and what you’re capable of.  Excellence is the result of loving more than others think is necessary, dreaming more than others think is practical, risking more than others think is safe, and doing more than others think is possible. Remember, it’s always better to be at the bottom of the ladder you want to climb than the top of the one you don’t.  Happiness and success is all about spending your life in your own way.  Always be yourself and walk your own path.  No one can ever tell you you’re doing it wrong.  Everyone has their own dreams, their own struggles, and a different path that makes sense for them.  You are YOU for a reason. If you end up living a boring, miserable life because you ignored yourself and instead listened to a parent, a teacher, or some gal on TV telling you how to live your life, then you have no one but yourself to blame.  Just remember, the smartest and most courageous act is simply to think for yourself and listen to you own intuition.  In the end, it’s better to die your way, than live someone else’s idea of your life.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” and “Relationships” chapters of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) What would you do differently if you knew nobody would judge you? Don’t let others crush your dreams.  Do just once what they say you can’t do, and you will never pay attention to their negativity again.  Don’t walk away from these negative people… RUN!  Good things happen when you distance yourself from negativity and those who create it. Truth be told, no one has the right to judge you.  People may have heard your stories, but they can’t feel what you are going through; they aren’t living YOUR life.  So forget what they say about you.  Focus on how you feel about yourself, and do what you know in your heart is right. Do what you know is right.  Integrity is doing the right thing, no matter what, even when nobody’s going to know whether you did it or not.  Life always finds its balance.  Don’t expect to get back everything you give.  Don’t expect recognition for every effort you make.  And don’t expect your kindness to be instantly recognized or your love to be understood by everyone you encounter. What seems like the right thing to do could also be the hardest thing you have ever done.  Do it anyway.  There is no greatness or peace of mind where there is betrayal of your own goodwill.  Always aim at complete sincerity of your thoughts, words and deeds.  If it is wrong, don’t do it.  If it is untrue, don’t repeat it.  Do what you do because you believe it’s the right thing to do.  Do the right thing even when nobody is looking.  Be one of the people who make a true difference in the world by leaving it a little better and more wholesome than you found it. Don’t let yesterday steal your present.  Don’t judge yourself by your past… you don’t live there anymore.  Let go, grow, and move forward.  As we grow older and wiser, we begin to realize what we need and what we need to leave behind.  Sometimes walking away is a step forward.  Sometimes a break from your routine is exactly what you need.  Unless you try to master something beyond what you already know, you will feel forever stuck. Don’t waste another minute regretting what you did yesterday, and start doing what you have to do now, so tomorrow you won’t regret what you did today.  It’s not too late.  If you feel like it is, it’s just your inner fears lying to you.  But remember, fear doesn’t exist anywhere except in your mind.  It’s difficult to follow your heart, but it’s a tragedy to let the lies of fear stop you.  (Read Awaken the Giant Within.) Does the walker choose the path, or the path the walker?  Believe it or not, sometimes it’s the latter. Sometimes the greatest dreams that come true are the dreams you never even knew you had.  It’s about open-minded exploration.  There are no wrong turns in life, only paths you didn’t know you were meant to walk.  You never can be certain what’s around the corner.  It could be everything, or it could be nothing.  You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and realize you’ve climbed to the peak of the most beautiful mountaintop. Some days you’ll find diamonds and some days all you’ll see is coal.  However, every day is a golden opportunity to learn, practice gratitude, and positively impact the world around you.  Do not ask for instant fulfillment in your life, but for patience to accept your current frustrations.  Do not ask for perfection in all you do, but for the wisdom to not repeat past mistakes.  Do not ask for more before saying, “THANK YOU” for everything you have already received. And remember, everything in life is temporary.  So if things are good, enjoy it.  It won’t last forever.  If things are bad, don’t worry because it won’t last forever either.  Just because life isn’t stress-free right now, doesn’t mean you can’t laugh.  Just because something is bothering you, doesn’t mean you can’t smile.  The trick is to be grateful when your mood is high and graceful when it is low. Great challenges make life interesting; overcoming them makes life meaningful.  It’s how you deal with failure and discomfort that determines your level of success and happiness.  Laugh at your mistakes and learn from them.  Joke about your troubles and gather strength from them.  Have fun with the challenges you face and then conquer them. Emotional discomfort in life, when accepted, rises, crests and crashes in a series of waves.  Each wave washes an old layer of you away and deposits treasures you never expected to find.  Out goes inexperience, in comes awareness; out goes frustration, in comes resilience; out goes hatred, in comes kindness.  No one would say these waves of emotional experience are easy to ride, but the rhythm of emotional discomfort that you learn to tolerate while doing so is natural, helpful and prevalent.  The discomfort eventually leaves you stronger and healthier than it found you.  (Read Man’s Search for Meaning.) Forgiveness is a promise.  When you forgive someone you are making a promise not to hold the unchangeable past against your present self.  Forgiveness doesn’t mean what happened was completely excusable, and it doesn’t necessarily mean that person should still be welcome in your life.  It simply means you have made peace with the pain, and are ready to let it go and move on with your life. Forgiveness has nothing to do with freeing a criminal of his or her crime.  It has everything to do with freeing yourself of the burden of being a victim – letting go of the pain and transforming yourself from victim to victor. You can’t make it through on your own.  None of us can.  That’s why, thank goodness, you are never as alone as you sometimes feel.  So many of us are fighting the same exact battle alongside you.  You may feel alone sometimes, but you are not alone in being alone. To lose sleep worrying about a loved one.  To have trouble picking yourself up after someone lets you down.  To feel rejected because someone didn’t care about you enough to stay.  To be afraid to try something new for fear you may fail.  None of this means you’re weird or dysfunctional.  It just means you’re human, and that you need a little time to regroup and re-calibrate yourself. No matter how embarrassed or pathetic you feel about your own situation, there are others out there experiencing the same emotions.  When you hear yourself say, “I am all alone,” it’s just your mind trying to sell you a lie.  There’s always someone who can relate to you.  Perhaps you can’t immediately talk to them, but they are out there, and that’s all you need to know right now. If I eavesdropped on your self-talk, would I hear statements that empower happiness, or statements that refute it?  The next time you decide to unclutter your life and clean up your space, start with your intellectual space by clearing out the old lies and negative self-talk you often recite to yourself. What would you add to the list?  What kind of negative self-talk do you need to stop?  What will you never say about yourself again?  Share your thoughts with us by leaving a comment below.

Cummings Life is to be enjoyed and appreciated, not endured and tolerated.  Which is why today is a perfect day to stop tolerating… Don’t let anyone’s negativity stop you from being happy.  Negative company will never give you a positive life.  Examine what you tolerate.  Every time you subtract negative from your life, you make room for more positive.  Happiness is found around encouraging, loving people. Learning to ignore certain people is one of the great paths to inner peace.  Life gets easier when you delete those who make it difficult. Remember, you can’t base your idea of success and happiness on other people’s opinions.  We’re not here to live up to each other’s expectations; we’re here to follow our own intuition and do our best.  When you clear out other people’s expectations, or the classic things you are “supposed” to want, you create the time needed to take steps towards your true destiny. Bruce Lee once said, “I’m not in this world to live up to your expectations and you’re not in this world to live up to mine.”  Let this be your motto from this day forward.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Stop focusing on how stressed you are and remember how blessed you are.  Complaining won’t change the outcome, but a positive attitude will.  Life is too short to spend at war with yourself.  Practice acceptance and forgiveness.  Don’t let dumb little things break your happiness. True wealth is the ability to experience and appreciate each moment for what it’s worth.  It is not what happens to you, but how you respond to what happens to you. Count your blessings while others are adding up their troubles.  No matter how bad it hurts now, someday you will look back and realize today’s struggles made you a much stronger person.  So always laugh when you can; it’s the cheapest medicine.  When you smile about the life you live, you end up living a life worth smiling about. The first step to living the life you want is leaving the life you don’t want.  Letting go of the past is your first step towards happiness. You are not your past failures.  You are not your past habits.   You are not how others have at one time treated you.  You are only who you think you are right now in this moment.  You are only what you do right now in this moment. You are here for a special reason.  Stop being a prisoner of your past.  Become the architect of your present and future.  Learn from your regrets, but do not punish yourself with them.  Live beyond your petty, fleeting fears and focus on the profound possibilities that await your immediate attention.  (Read The Untethered Soul.) Today, stop making excuses for why you can’t get it done and start focusing on all the reasons why you must make it happen.  Stop talking about what you have done or what you are going to do.  Just do it and let your actions speak for themselves.  Most great things in life don’t happen by chance, they happen by choice.  You never know what’s possible until you risk finding out. Remember, it’s always better to look ahead and prepare than to look back and regret.  In the end, there is only one thing that makes your dreams and goals completely impossible to achieve:  Your lack of action. You deserve to be happy.  You deserve to live a life you are excited about.  Don’t let others make you forget that.  Don’t play it so safe that you put yourself in situations where none of your potential options satisfy your calling. Have you ever tucked something of value in a “safe place” out of fear that you might lose it?  And then one day awoke to the realization that you hid it so well, even YOU can no longer find it?  If so, then you understand the wisdom of leaving your heart and dreams unlocked and open.  To reach for what can be, even when you’re doubtful…  To let go of what is lost, even when it’s painful…  To live as though you’re brave, even when you’re fearful…  These are the trials you face and the choices you must make along the path to happiness and success. Close your eyes for a moment and ask yourself this:  Isn’t it better to be extremely happy for a while, even if you eventually lose it, than to be just okay for your whole life?  (Read Buddha’s Brain.) The most difficult phase of life is not when no one understands you, it’s when you don’t understand yourself.  It is easy to live for others, and so many people do, but I challenge you to live for yourself and your own values, ideas, and dreams.  Believe in yourself.  Listen to your soul.  Yes, help others, but don’t neglect YOU in the process.  Give yourself the time you deserve. Live your life so that when you’re old, you never have to let the person you became fantasize about the person you were capable of being.  And someday when it’s time to ask where all the time went, you can answer, “It went to joyful moments of self-discovery, to passionate endeavors, to doing work that felt like play, to standing up for what I believe in, and to exploring this beautiful world with an open heart.  My time went to living MY life!” Needless tolerations can bleed you dry and make it impossible for you to function effectively.  You can’t live a happy, fulfilling life if you’re spending all your energy tolerating things that shouldn’t be tolerated.  It’s time to put your foot down. Remember, life is change, but growth is optional.  So choose wisely starting now.  Let today be the first day of the rest of your new life… What would you add to this post?  What sources of stress do you tolerate too often?  Please leave us a comment below and share your thoughts.

"9 Ways to Never Regret Another Day of Your Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/9-never-regret-life.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| 10 Places Unhappy People Search for Happiness|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-unhappy-people-search.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| “I’ve got nothing to do today but smile.”?Paul Simon This past holiday season Angel and I stayed at a hotel near her parent’s house in South Florida.  On Christmas Eve we met a family of six who were staying at the same hotel.  We saw them relaxing in the lobby by the Christmas tree, sharing stories and laughing.  So on our way out, Angel and I wished them a happy holiday season and asked them where they were from.  “Oh, we’re from here,” the mother said.  “Our house burned down to the ground yesterday, but miraculously, all of us made it out safely.  And that makes this a very merry Christmas.” Her words and her family’s optimistic attitude made me smile.  They reminded me that the most fulfilling moments in life come when we finally find the courage to let go of what we can’t change.  And that when life gives us every reason to be negative, we must think of one good reason to be positive, because there’s always something worth smiling about. Truth be told, when people are perpetually unhappy it’s often because they are searching for happiness in the wrong places.  They look for it… Life is tough, but you are tougher.  Pain makes you stronger.  Facing fear makes you braver.  Mistakes and heartbreak make you wiser.   Sometimes things have to go very wrong before they can be right.  Sometimes you have to go through the worst, to arrive at your best. Your journey isn’t supposed to be easy, it’s supposed to be worth it.  To never struggle is to never grow.  It doesn’t matter what’s happened or what you’ve done; what matters is what you choose to do from here.  Accept the circumstances, learn from them, and move on.  Letting go is often a step forward.  Sometimes you have to walk away from what you thought you wanted to find what you truly need and deserve. You are changing.  The universe around you is changing.  Just because something was right for you in the past doesn’t mean it still is.  This could be a relationship, a job, a home, a habit, etc.  Giving things up doesn’t always mean you’re weak; it may simply mean you’re strong enough and smart enough to let go of the old to make way for the new.  Don’t stress about the closed doors behind you.  New doors are opening every moment and you will see them if you keep moving forward. As the Dalai Lama once said, “A new way of thinking has become the necessary condition for responsible living and acting.  If we maintain obsolete values and beliefs, a fragmented consciousness and self-centered spirit, we will continue to hold onto outdated goals and behaviors.” (Read Buddha’s Brain.) Too often we spend our energy stuck in the maze of life, thinking about how we’ll escape one day, and how amazing it will be.  And imagining a future like this keeps us going, or so it seems.  But we never escape.  We simply use thoughts of the future to escape the present, over and over again, until we’ve reached the end of our lives without ever having truly lived. Mahatma Gandhi once said, “The future depends on what you do today.”  Nothing could be closer to the truth.  Do something today!  You can’t stop the future.  You can’t rewind the past.  The only way to live is to press play.  Go ahead and press play!  The clock is ticking – the hours are going by.  The past increases and the future recedes, possibilities decreasing and regrets mounting… but only if you hesitate to accept and enjoy your life right now while you’re living it. The best thing you can do for yourself is to stop saying “I wish,” start saying “I will,” and then go do something about it.  The world isn’t going to dominate itself.  You just have to wake up one morning and decide that you don’t want to feel like this anymore, ever again.  And then make a change, just like that. In all walks of life, luck happens when preparation meets opportunity.  And opportunity dances only with those who are already on the dance floor. If something doesn’t have space in your day, it probably won’t happen in your life.  Knowing isn’t enough; you must apply.  Willing isn’t enough; you must DO.  If all you can do right now is a little bit, do it.  Those little bits will add up quickly.  Value that is built over time, in small increments, tends to be value that also lasts for a long time.  Doing something, even if it is just a little bit, is infinitely more productive than doing nothing. You may feel comfortable bobbing around in the little lake that you’re used to, but if you don’t stretch your comfort zone and venture out into the adjoining waterways, you’ll never discover the beauty and immensity of the ocean – you will never even know it exists.  Holding on to what’s comfortable may be the very reason you often feel like something is missing in your life. Remember, just because you venture out into the world doesn’t mean you can’t return home whenever you want to.  It’s okay to come back to where you started, but it’s NOT OKAY to never leave.  (Read Start: Punch Fear in the Face.) You can never, ever get enough of what you do NOT need to make you happy.  Think about it.  It’s nice to have money and the things that money can buy, but it’s also important to make sure you haven’t lost track of the priceless things money can’t buy.  You don’t need a lot of money to lead a rich life.  Good friends and a loving family are worth their weight in gold.  It really is the little things that mean the most… like a long hug at just the right time. Instead of focusing so intently on what you want to get, consider the things you can let go of.  Eliminate some excess baggage, lighten your load and feel a weight lifted.  So many of the things you think you need you do not need at all, you simply want them.  And as your wants diminish, your freedom and abundance grow.  Challenge your impulses, and free yourself of needless needs. As Oscar Wilde once said, “Everything in moderation, including moderation.” Eating too much makes you obese.  Spending too much money makes you broke.  Working too much leaves your family at home missing you.  Playing too much leaves important work undone…  and so on and so forth. Happiness depends on the proper distribution of applying your positive resources consciously to the hungry deficits in your life.  All details aside, the important thing to remember is this:  Long-term happiness is never found in one good thing; it is a combination, it is a balanced lifestyle. Know that it’s less important to have more relationships and more important to have quality ones.  Spend time with people who make you better.  Surround yourself with those who are going to lift you higher.  You will only ever be as great as the people you surround yourself with, so be brave enough to let go of those who keep bringing you down.  Find people who respect you as much as you respect them.  Nurture your relationships only with those who are happy and proud to have you in their lives. You deserve it.  Don’t settle. Keep up your dignity and always be true to yourself.  You can’t let other people tell you who you are.  You have to decide that for yourself. There will always be people who don’t approve of you – the way you look, the way you talk, the things you care about, the styles you like, the music you listen to, etc.  But the truth is these people’s opinions don’t matter one bit.  It’s up to you if you let them ruin your day, or if you decide to stand up for yourself and accept yourself just the way you are.  Just be sincere and do your best.  And if it’s not good enough for someone, it will surely be for someone else.  You’re not here to please everyone.  Be nice, be yourself, and the right people will eventually find you.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Sigmund Freud once said, “Most people do not really want freedom, because freedom involves responsibility, and most people are frightened of responsibility.”  Don’t let this be you.  When you blame others for what you’re going through, you deny responsibility – you surrender full power over that part of your life. In reality, the price of happiness and greatness IS responsibility.  And no one else is responsible for you.  You are in full control of your life so long as you claim it and own it.  Through the grapevine, you may have learned that you should blame your parents, your teachers, your mentors, the public education system, the government, etc., but never to blame yourself.  Right?  It’s never, ever your fault… WRONG!  It’s always your fault, because if you want to change – if you want to grow and move on with your life – the only person who can make it happen is YOU. When it comes to finding happiness, where do some people make a wrong turn?  Where else can happiness NOT be found?  Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

Here are some thoughts to consider: First and foremost, family isn’t always blood.  They’re the people in your life who appreciate having you in theirs – the ones who encourage you to improve in healthy and exciting ways, and who not only embrace who you are now, but also embrace and embody who you want to be.  Family members can be your best friends.  And best friends, whether or not they’re related to you by blood, can be your family. Family is built with love; it’s not determined by marriage certificates, divorce papers, and formal adoption documents.  Families grow from the heart, through mutual love and respect.  The only time family becomes nullified is when the ties in the heart are cut.  If you cut the ties, these people are not your family.  If you build the ties, these people are your family.  So build and maintain ties with the right people and nurture them with love every day. Family bonds are tied with true love, and true love involves attention, awareness, discipline, effort, and being able to care about someone and sacrifice for them, continuously, in countless petty little unsexy ways, every day.  You put your arms around them and love them regardless, even when they’re not very lovable.  And of course they do the same for you. If you want to know what a healthy family is, it’s one where each family member wakes up every morning and says, “This is worth it.  You all are worth it.  I am happy you are in my life.”  It’s about sacrifice.  It’s about knowing that some days you will have to do things you dislike to make the people you love smile, and feeling perfectly delighted to do so.  That’s what it means to “be family.”  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) “Being family” is also about supporting each other through life’s inevitable changes.  It’s knowing that your family will be there watching out for you through thick and thin.  Nothing and no one else will give you that.  Not your career.  Not your boss.  Not your clients.  Not money.  Not fame. You can’t promise to be there for someone for the rest of their life, but you can sincerely be there for them for the rest of yours.  Stand by those you care about in their darkest moments, not because you want to stand in the dark, but because you don’t want them to either.  Brave the shadows alongside them until they’re able to find the light.  On the flip-side, stand by these same people on their sunniest days, not because you want to scorch your skin, but because you’re not afraid to let them shine bright. And remember, timing is everything.  There is a time for silence, a time to let go and allow your loved ones to launch themselves into their own destiny, and a time to cheer for their victories, or help them pick up the pieces, when it’s all over. The deepest craving of human nature is the need to be appreciated as is.  Sometimes we try to be sculptors, constantly carving out of others the image of what we want them to be – what we think we need, love, or desire.  But these actions and perceptions are against reality, against their benefit and ours, and always end in disappointment – because it does not fit them. Remember, the foundation of love is to let those we care about be unapologetically themselves, and to not distort them to fit our own egotistical ideas of who they should be.  Otherwise we love only our own fantasies, and thus miss out entirely on their true beauty. Happiness is a choice that comes from within.  Being happy doesn’t mean everything is perfect, it means you’ve decided to look beyond the imperfections.  There are choices you can make every day to feel the effects of happiness.  Choose to do something meaningful.  Choose to take care of your body.  Choose to be around the right people.  Choose a good attitude.  Choose to express gratitude.  Choose to forgive.  Choose to focus on what you have, not on what you haven’t. Begin today by taking responsibility for your own happiness.  The choice is yours.  Your family can support you, but they can’t choose happiness for you.  (Read Hardwiring Happiness.) You can measure the happiness of any close relationship by the number of scars that each member carries on their tongues and inner cheeks, formed over many years of biting back angry and insensitive words. Bottom line:  Be careful what you say.  You can say something unkind in less than one second, but more than a year later the wounds are still there.  Don’t do this to your family, or anyone for that matter.  Every time words are spoken, something is created.  Be honest, but also conscious of what you say and how you say it.  Use words that build up, appreciate, encourage and inspire. Cheating and lying aren’t struggles, they’re reasons families break up.  Because great things fall apart quite easily when they’ve been held together with lies. The truth is, relationships don’t hurt.  Lying, cheating and twisting reality until it toys with someone’s emotions is what hurts.  Promises mean everything, but after they’re broken, sorry means nothing (at least initially).  So never mess with someone’s feelings just because you’re unsure of your own.  If you are unsure in any way, be sure to say so.  Always be open and honest.  And remember that when the truth is replaced by silence, silence becomes a lie too. Here’s a harsh reality of life:  Regardless of the quality of your relationships with your parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins, or close friends, you will miss them when they’re gone from your life.  And someday they will be. You have to set aside quality time to share your love openly and honestly with those you love.  Realize that no matter how much time you spend with someone you care about, or how much you appreciate them, sometimes it will never seem like you had enough time together.  Don’t learn this lesson the hard way.  Express your love.  Tell your family what you need to tell them.  Don’t shy away from important conversations because you feel awkward or uncomfortable.  You never know when you might lose your opportunity. So stay in close touch with what’s going on in your loved ones’ lives – communicate openly on a regular basis.  Not because it’s convenient, but because they are worth the extra effort. The greatest path to positive influence in any relationship is love.  And the greatest path to love is full acceptance within the present moment – allowing everything to be as it is, without hoping or trying to change things. Presence is recognizing and celebrating that we are all inextricably connected to each other by a power greater than all of us, and that our connection to that power and to one another is grounded in the “now.”  It’s about knowing that you must first attend to the reality of the moment before you can effectively contribute anything positive to it.  Practicing presence brings a sense of perspective and purpose to our lives, and opens the doorway to love others as they are. Being completely present with someone is difficult, however, because it requires you to share yourself completely, vulnerabilities and all, and enter moments of unguarded honesty with this person.  And this person may hurt you, and you may hurt them too.  Yes, you will hurt each other sometimes.  But this is the very condition of full presence.  To become summer, means accepting the risk of winter.  To become present, means accepting the risk of absence.  (Read The Power of Now.) No matter how honest and kind you try to be, you will occasionally step on the toes of the people closest to you.  And this is precisely why patience and forgiveness are so vital.  Patience is the ability to let your light shine on those you love, even after your fuse has blown.  And forgiveness is knowing deep down that they didn’t mean to blow your fuse in the first place. Patience and forgiveness can be bitter at first, but the seeds you plant now will bear sweet fruit in the end.

Among these items is an old leather-bound journal that she aptly named her Inspiration Journal. Throughout the second half of her life, she used this journal to jot down ideas, thoughts, quotes, song lyrics, and anything else that moved her. She would read excerpts from her journal to me when I was growing up, and I would listen and ask questions. I honestly credit a part of who I am now to the wisdom she bestowed on me when I was young. Although I’ve shared some of her wisdom in the past here on the blog and with our email subscribers, today is the day she became an angel fifteen years ago. So to honor her, I want to share some of my favorite excerpts from her journal with you. I’ve done my best to sort, copyedit, and reorganize her thoughts into twelve inspiring bullet points. I hope you find value in them. No matter where you are or what you’re going through, always believe that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Never expect, assume, or demand. Just do your best, control the elements you can control, and then let it be. Because once you have done what you can, if it is meant to be, it will happen, or it will show you the next step that needs to be taken. Just choose to focus on one thing at a time. You don’t have to do it all, and you don’t have to do it all right now. Breathe, be present, and do your best with what’s in front of you. What you put into life, life will eventually give you back many times over. (Read The Power of Now.) Speak and walk your truth even if your voice and legs shake. By being yourself, you put something beautiful into the world that was not there before. So walk your path confidently and don’t expect anyone else to understand your journey, especially if they have not been exactly where you are going. You’ve been hurt; you’ve gone through numerous ups and downs that have made you who you are today. Over the years, so many things have happened – things that have changed your perspective, taught you lessons, and forced your spirit to grow. As time passes, nobody stays the same, but some people will still tell you that you have changed. Respond to them by saying, “Of course I’ve changed. That’s what life is all about. But I’m still the same person, just a little stronger now than I ever was before.” Circumstances will direct you, correct you, and perfect you over time. So whatever you do, hold on to hope. The tiniest thread will twist into an unbreakable cord. Let hope anchor you in the possibility that this is not the end of your story – that the change in the tides will eventually bring you to peaceful shores. Don’t just educate yourself to be rich, educate yourself to be happy. That way when you get older you’ll know the true value of things, not the price. You will come to realize that the best days are the days when you don’t need anything extreme or special to happen to make you smile. You simply appreciate the moments and feel gratitude, seeking nothing else, nothing more. That is what true happiness is all about in the end. (Note: Our newest publication via Penguin Random House, “The Good Morning Journal: Powerful Prompts and Reflections to Start Every Day”, is a great tool for daily gratitude and self-reflection.) Understand that the greater part of your misery or unhappiness is determined not by your circumstances, but by your attitude. So smile at those who often try to begrudge or hurt you, show them what’s missing in their life and what they can’t take away from you. Sometimes when a loved one says, “I’m okay,” they need you to look them in the eyes, hug them tight, and reply, “I know you’re not.” And don’t be too upset if some people only seem to remember you when they need you. Feel privileged that you are like a beacon of light that comes to their minds when there is darkness in their lives. Sometimes you have to let a person go so they can grow. Because, over the course of their lives, it is not what you do for them, but what you have taught them to do for themselves that will make them a successful human being. Sometimes getting the results you crave means stripping yourself of people that don’t serve your best interests. This allows you to make space for those who support you in being the absolute best version of yourself. It happens gradually as you grow. You find out who you are and what you want, and then you realize that people you’ve known forever don’t see things the way you do. So you keep the wonderful memories, but find yourself moving on. It’s usually better to look back on life and say, “I can’t believe I did that,” than to look back and say, “I wish I did that.” In the end, people will judge you in some way anyway. So don’t live your life trying to impress others. Instead live your life impressing yourself. Love yourself enough to never lower your standards for anyone. (Read The Last Lecture.) If you’re looking for a happy ending and can’t seem to find one, maybe it’s time to start looking for a new beginning. Brush yourself off and accept that you have to fail from time to time. That’s how you learn. The strongest people out there — the ones who laugh the hardest with a genuine smile — are the same people who have fought the toughest battles. They’re smiling because they’ve decided that they’re not going to let anything hold them down, they’re moving on to a new beginning. As I’m wrapping up this short tribute to my grandmother, I’m reminded of a poem excerpt by Christian D. Larson that she used to have hanging on her refrigerator when I was a kid. As soon as I was old enough to understand the poem, my grandmother made a photocopy of it for me, and over 30 years later I still have that same photocopy laminated and hanging on my office bulletin board. Although I’ve shared this poem in past blog posts over the years, I wanted to re-share it here, as these are words my grandmother said she strived to live by: “Promise Yourself… To think only the best, to work only for the best,and to do the best you can.To be just as enthusiastic about the success of othersas you are about your own. To forgive the mistakes of the pastand press on to greater achievements in the present.To wear a friendly countenance at all timesand give every living creature you meet a smile. To give so much time to the improvement of yourselfthat you have no time to criticize others.To be too focused for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear,and too at peace to permit the presence of trouble. To think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world,not in loud words but great deeds.To live in faith that the whole world is on your sideso long as you are true to the best that is in you.” (Note: Angel and I discuss strategies for living true to these words in the Happiness & Self-Love chapters of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently”.)

"3 Questions that Will Free Your Mind and Turn Your Life Around|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/3-questions-free-mind.jpg?resize=500%2C477&ssl=1| “Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers.”?Voltaire It’s not the answers you get from others, but the questions you ask yourself that will help you grow stronger.  In fact, the simple questions you ask yourself on a daily basis will determine the type of person you become in the long run. And that’s precisely why we recorded today’s video blog post – to help you embark on a positive journey of self-inquiry.  Keep in mind that these questions have no right or wrong answers… Because sometimes asking the right questions IS the answer. Remember, the way you treat yourself sets the standard for others.  You must love who you are or no one else will.  So treat yourself the way you want others to treat you.  Stop discrediting yourself for everything you aren’t, and start giving yourself credit for everything you ARE.  We have to learn to be our own best friends, because sometimes we fall too easily into the trap of being our own worst enemies. Honestly, the amount of abuse you tolerate in your relationships is often equal to the amount of abuse you heap on yourself.  If you are used to telling yourself that you’re unattractive, that you are destined to fail, and that you’re not capable of performing in the world without someone holding your hand, then you will accept and feel most comfortable in relationships with people who reinforce these same negative beliefs. Because that’s what careless words do – they clutter your mind and make you love yourself and life a little less. So when you’re hanging out by yourself, watch how you talk to yourself.  Watch your thoughts.  Keep in mind that it is only ever our own thoughts that hurt us.  It’s how we choose to think about it all.  You know this is true.  You think 60,000 thoughts a day.  Don’t waste fifty nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine of them on limited, negative thinking. In fact, review your self-talk right now.  How well have you chosen the words you’ve recently used to talk to yourself?  Have you put them to positive or negative use?  If I eavesdropped on your self-talk a minute ago, would I have heard statements that empower happiness, or statements that refute it? The bottom line is that your relationship with yourself is the closest and most important relationship you will ever, ever have.  So let me ask you this:  When was the last time someone told you that they loved you just the way you are, and that what you think and how you feel matters?  When was the last time someone told you that you did a great job, or took you someplace special to celebrate one of your small, everyday victories, simply because they know you deserve it?  When was the last time that “someone” was YOU?  (Read The Mastery of Love.) Think long and hard.  And when your answer is NO for too many days in a row, you know it’s time for a change. And this is an interesting conversation, because we are all aware deep down that life is short, and that death will happen to every one of us eventually, and yet we are infinitely surprised when it happens to someone we know.  It’s like walking up a flight of stairs with a distracted mind, and misjudging the final step.  You expected there to be one more stair than there is, and so you find yourself off balance for a moment, before your mind shifts back to reality and how the world really is. So LIVE your life TODAY!  Don’t ignore death, but don’t be afraid of it either.  Be afraid of a life you never lived because you were too afraid to take positive action.  Death is not the greatest loss in life.  The greatest loss is what dies inside you while you’re still alive.  Be bold.  Be courageous.  Be scared to death, and then take the next step in the direction of your dreams ANYWAY. You’ve got to take that step.  Because sadly, there are far too many people who live their entire lives on the default settings, never realizing they can customize absolutely everything.  Don’t be one of them!  You have to live your own life your own way.  That’s all there is to it.  Each of us has a unique fire in our heart for something that makes us feel alive.  It’s your duty to find it and keep it lit.  You’ve got to stop caring so much about what everyone else wants for you, and start actually living for yourself. Find your love, your talents, your passions, and embrace them.  Don’t hide behind other people’s decisions.  Don’t let others tell you what you want.  Design and experience YOUR life!  The life you create from doing something that moves you is far better than the life you get from sitting around wishing you were doing it.  So do something today, and every day, that moves you, even if you can only spare ten minutes here and there. It happens to you slowly as you grow.  You discover more about who you are and what you want, and then you realize that there are changes you need to make.  The lifestyle you’ve been living no longer fits.  The people you’ve known forever no longer see things the way you do.  So you cherish all the great memories, but find yourself in desperate need of moving on. Some things simply are NOT meant to be.  Everything from your past does not belong in your present.  To hold on to relationships and circumstances that have already moved on without you, is to stay stuck in a place and time that no longer exists.  Moving on doesn’t mean you erase or completely forget the wonderful things from your past, it just means that you find a positive way of surviving without them in your present. Truth be told, we all have a story.  We have all gone through something that has changed us in a way that we could never go back to who we once were.  In life, this kind of change is inevitable.  Everything around you is impermanent – your body, your possessions, your relationships, and so forth.  You don’t have control over every little thing that happens to you, but you do have control over how you decide to internalize it. Pay as much attention to the changes that are working positively in your life as you do to those changes that are giving you trouble.  Appreciate how the unexpected is sometimes better than what you expected.  And above all, stop stressing over what’s behind you.  The end of something good is always the beginning of something great.  Say to yourself: “Dear Past, thank you for all the life lessons you have taught me.  Dear Present, I am ready now!”  Because a priceless new beginning always occurs at the point you thought would be the end of everything. So don’t sweat the small stuff.  Live simply.  Love generously.  Speak truthfully.  Work diligently.  Then let go, and let what’s meant to be, BE.  (Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Simplicity” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) As you know, Marc and I are committed to asking the right questions along with you.  In fact, we believe self-inquiry is one of the surest paths to personal freedom and positive change.  And this is precisely why we ask one new thought-provoking question at the end of every one of our blog posts here on Marc and Angel Hack Life. So today, we challenge you to a little self-inquiry starting with the three questions we discussed in this post.  Please leave a comment below and let us know what your initial reaction was to each question. Photo by: Dhilung Kirat 40 Amazing Things You Will Never Forget|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/40-amazing-things.jpg?resize=500%2C375&ssl=1|NOTE: This post has been updated in 2020 with new stories and data, and moved to here:40 Incredible Life Experiences You Will Never ForgetPhoto by: Hamish Irvine 10 Things to Remember When You Feel Lost and Alone|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-lost-and-alone.jpg?resize=500%2C469&ssl=1| “Being alone never felt right.  Sometimes it felt good, but it never felt right.”— Charles Bukowski “This morning I felt lost and alone as I was driving home after a brutal breakup with my boyfriend.  I turned on the radio and the Michael Jackson song ‘You Are Not Alone’ was playing.  A few seconds later, at the exact moment the chorus began, I passed a huge billboard sign with big black letters that read, ‘YOU ARE NOT ALONE!’” That’s the opening paragraph of an email I received today from a reader named Ella.  It made me smile because I love when life delivers seemingly coincidental, positive messages like that, right when we need them most. However, the rest of Ella’s email further described her ongoing struggle with feeling “lost and alone” in life.  Which got me thinking… Why do people have to feel this way?  What’s the point of it all?  Millions of people in this world, all of them craving connection, and looking for specific experiences and people to satisfy them, yet inadvertently isolating themselves in the process.  Why?  Was the planet put here just to nourish our loneliness? The more I’ve experienced and explored my own feelings of uncertainty and loneliness, the more I’ve realized how necessary these feelings are.  It’s good for us to spend time exploring unknowns, alone.  It gives us an opportunity to discover who we really are and what life is all about. Here are some things to keep in mind when you feel lost and alone: So many of us are fighting the same exact battle alongside you.  We are all in this together.  So no matter how embarrassed or pathetic you feel about your own situation, know that there are others out there experiencing the same emotions.  When you hear yourself say, “I am all alone,” it’s just your worried mind trying to sell you a lie.  There’s always someone who can relate to you.  Perhaps you can’t immediately talk to them, but they are out there, and that’s all you need to know right now. Sometimes you need to be alone, not to be lonely, but to enjoy a little free time just being yourself and finding your way.  In other words, the moments you feel lonely are the moments you may most need to be by yourself.  This is one of life’s cruelest ironies. We need solitude, because when we’re alone we’re detached from obligations, we don’t need to put on a show, and we can hear our own thoughts and feel what our intuition is telling us.  And the truth is, throughout your life there will be times when the world gets real quiet and the only thing left is the beat of your own heart.  So you’d better learn the sound of it, otherwise you’ll never understand what it’s telling you.  (Read Quiet: The Power of Introverts.) Not until you are lost in this world can you begin to find your best path.  Realizing you are lost is the first step to living the life you want.  The second step is leaving the life you don’t want.  Making a big life change is pretty scary.  But you know what’s even scarier?  Regret. I can tell you from my own life experience that I’ve found love, lost it, found it, lost it and then I found it once again.  But each time what I found was more incredible than the last.  So remember that everyone suffers in life at some point.  Everyone feels lost sometimes.  The key is using your experiences to grow.  When you apply what you’re learning to your future choices and actions, you move forward not backward.  You become stronger and wiser.  It’s not easy, but it’s worth it in the end. You cannot find peace by avoiding life.  Life spins with unexpected changes; so instead of avoiding it, take every change and experience as a challenge for growth.  Either it will give you what you want or it will teach you what the next step is.  And remember, finding peace in life does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, no challenges, and no hard work.  It means to be in the midst of those things while remaining calm in your heart. Honestly, life is too short to spend at war with yourself.  The biggest disappointments in our lives are often the result of misplaced expectations.  Letting go of needless expectations is your first step to happiness.  Come from a mindset of peace and acceptance, and you can deal with almost anything and grow beyond it. Be determined to be positive.  Understand that the greater part of your misery or unhappiness is determined not by your circumstances, but by your attitude.  A happy person is not a person who’s always in a good situation, but rather a person who always has a good attitude in every situation.  So smile at those who often try to begrudge or hurt you; show them what’s missing in their life and what they can’t take away from you.  Doing so doesn’t mean forgetting or giving in, it means you choose happiness over hurt.  (Read Buddha’s Brain.) The trouble is not always in being alone; it’s being lonely in the presence of others.  One can be lonely in the midst of a crowd.  Wouldn’t you agree?  So keep this in mind and choose your relationships wisely.  It’s always better to be alone than to be in bad company.  And when you do decide to come back for someone, do so because you’re truly better off with this person.  Don’t do it just for the sake not being alone. Friends and family won’t always support your goals, but you must pursue them anyway.  Follow your intuition.  Following your intuition means doing what feels right, even if it doesn’t look or sound right to others.  Only time will tell, but our human instincts are rarely wrong.  Even if things don’t turn out as you anticipated, at least you won’t have to spend the rest of your life wondering what could have been.  So don’t worry about what everyone else thinks; just keep living and speaking your truth. Ultimately, you know you’re on the right track in life when you become uninterested in looking back, and eager to take the next step, regardless of what anyone else thinks. You’ve been hurt; you’ve gone through numerous ups and downs that have made you who you are today.  Over the years, so many things have happened – things that have changed your perspective, taught you lessons, and forced your spirit to grow.  As time passes, nobody stays the same, but some people will still tell you that you have changed.  Respond to them by saying, “Of course I’ve changed.  That’s what life is all about.  I’m still the same human being, just a little stronger now than I ever was before.” Always do your best.  And realize that “your best” is going to change repeatedly.  For instance, it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best in the present moment and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.  And remember that no matter what’s happening, you can efficiently fight the battles of just today.  It’s only when you add the battles of those two abysmal eternities, yesterday and tomorrow, that life gets overwhelmingly complicated.  It’s necessary, therefore, to let yourself live just one day at a time – just today – just right here, right now.  And do the best you can in it.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self_love” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) The seemingly useless happenings add up to something.  The minimum wage job you had in high school.  The evenings you spent socializing with colleagues you never see anymore.  The hours you spent writing thoughts on a personal blog that no one reads.  Contemplations about elaborate future plans that never came to be.  All those lonely nights spent reading novels and news columns and comics strips and fashion magazines and questioning your own principles on life and sex and religion and whether or not you’re good enough just the way you are.  All of this has strengthened you.  All of this has led you to every success you’ve ever had.  All of this has made you who you are today. What helps you stay positive when you feel lost and alone?  What’s something encouraging you try to keep in mind when you’re up against lots of uncertainty?  Leave a comment below and share your thoughts. Photo by: Little Zoker 20 Self-Confidence Traps Holding Smart People Back|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/25-self-confidence.jpg?resize=500%2C336&ssl=1| 8 Things You Should Never Give Up for a Relationship|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/8-give-up-relationship.jpg?resize=500%2C331&ssl=1| Being alone doesn’t mean you’re weak, it simply means you’re strong enough to wait for the right relationship. “It’s been exactly ten years since my controlling, abusive ex-fiancé sold my favorite guitar which cost almost $1,000 and took me ages to save for.  He sold it on the day I broke up with him.  When I went to pick up my belongings, he was proud that he had sold it to a local pawnshop.  Luckily, I managed to track down the guy that bought it from the pawnshop.  The guy was really sweet and gave it back to me for free, on the condition that I join him on his front porch for an hour and play guitar with him.  He grabbed a second guitar and we ended up sitting there on his porch for the rest of the afternoon playing music, talking, and laughing.  He’s been my husband for almost nine years now, and we are happier now than ever.” That’s a paraphrased version of a story one of our coaching clients, Megan, lived through a while back.  It’s one of those life stories that really stuck with me – one that I still think about on a regular basis.  And it immediately came to mind this morning when a new reader of ours, Jay, emailed me a long story about his present, broken relationship.  Specifically this one line jumped out at me:  “I feel like I’ve given up my love, my passions, my friendships, and my life for her, but it’s never enough.” Using Megan’s story as a frame of reference, we are reminded that unhealthy relationships restrict and impair, while healthy relationships bring freedom and life to our existence.  It’s important to remember the difference.  It’s important to remember what you should NEVER have to give up for a relationship.  And that’s what this article is about – some good reminders for Jay, and for all of us… It’s not hard to find someone who tells you they love you; it’s hard to find someone who actually means it.  But you will find them eventually, so don’t rush love, and don’t settle.  Find someone who isn’t afraid to admit they miss you.  Someone who knows you’re not perfect, but appreciates you as you are.  One who gives their heart completely.  Someone who says, “I love you” and then proves it day in and day out.  Find someone who wouldn’t mind waking up with you in the morning, seeing your wrinkles and grey hair, and then falls in love with you all over again. Remember, to the people who truly love you, you are magnificent already.  This is not because they’re blind to your shortcomings, but because they so vividly see the beauty of your soul.  Your shortcomings then dim by comparison.  The people who care about you are willing to let you be imperfect and magnificent, at the same time. Don’t put the only keys to your growth and happiness in someone else’s pocket.  Relationships are not about authority and obedience; they’re agreements of love and respect.  You simply can’t live your entire life through someone else’s fantasies.  There must be compromise and the space to do what’s right for you, even if someone you care about disagrees.  Give, but don’t allow yourself to be used.  Listen to loved ones, but don’t lose track of your inner voice in the process. Never apologize for what you feel and what you don’t feel; that’s a betrayal of your truth.  No matter how much advice people give you, sometimes you have to feel things out for yourself, make decisions on your own, experience things firsthand, and build your own conclusions from the ground up the old fashion way.  (Read Choose Yourself.) There’s honestly nothing more intimate than simply being understood and understanding someone else in return.  Even when there are disagreements, every healthy relationship contains this mutual understanding – a loving space filled with listening and compromise. So remember to listen without defending, and speak without offending.  Communication isn’t just an important part of a relationship, it is the relationship.  And really, there’s only one rule for being a good communicator: the willingness to hear others.  Because we do not always need a busy mind that speaks, just a patient heart that listens. Love is the creative force of the universe.  It is as important to life as oxygen is to breathing.  When it is present in our lives we feel happier, more optimistic and fulfilled.  Without it, we become angry, cynical, resentful people, critical of ourselves and others, effectively squashing the greatness that exists in us, and diminishing our own light. Open your heart and let love out.  Love people.  Love experiences.  Love yourself.  And let go of those who try to stop you. To live a great life, you must lose your fear of being wrong.  Remember that doing something and getting it wrong is at least ten times more productive than doing nothing.  Even when things don’t work out, they do.  Because in the end, experience is what you get when you didn’t get exactly what you wanted, and experience is often the most valuable thing you have to give. So don’t be too timid and squeamish about your actions.  Don’t let someone scare you out of failing forward.  All of life is an experiment.  The more experiments you make the better.  Either you will succeed or you will learn the next best step.  Win-win.  (Read Start.) Never let anyone or anything get in the way of your joy.  Live a life that makes you smile.  Because you don’t want to get to the end, or to tomorrow, even, and realize that your life is a collection of meetings and “someday’s” and errands and receipts and empty promises. So go ahead and sing out loud in the car with the windows down, and dance in your living room, and stay up all night laughing, and paint your walls any color you want, and enjoy some port wine and chocolate cake.  Yes, and go ahead and sleep in on clean white sheets, and throw parties, and paint, and write poetry, and read books so good they make you lose track of time.  And just keep living and laughing and making God glad that he gave life to someone who loves and cherishes the gift. If a relationship is closing you off from the world, it’s time to break free.  It’s time to choose love over deception.  After all, that’s what love is all about – freedom. So don’t blame love if a broken relationship is interfering with your other important relationships, or robbing you of your self-esteem and personal freedoms.  No, don’t blame love.  For it isn’t love that’s stealing from you.  It’s possession.  It’s obsession.  It’s manipulation.  It’s confusion.  Love has nothing to do with your situation.  For love doesn’t close the door on happiness and liberty.  It opens it wide to let more in. Likewise, if someone expects you to be someone you’re not, take a step back.  It’s wiser to lose relationships over being who you are, than to keep them intact by pretending to be someone else.  It’s easier to nurse a little heartache and meet someone new, than it is to piece together your own shattered identity.  It’s easier to fill an empty space within your life where someone else used to be, than it is to fill the empty space within yourself where YOU used to be.  (Angel and I discuss this in detail in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) No matter what you do or how amazing you are, throughout your lifetime some people will still upset you, disrespect you, and treat you poorly.  Let them be; let karma deal with the cruel things they have done.  Hatred and negativity filling your heart and mind will only consume you and your potential.  You will begin to heal and grow emotionally when you let go of these past hurts, excuse the people who have wronged you, and forgive yourself for your misjudgments. Bottom line:  Learning to ignore certain people and situations is one of the great paths to inner peace.  So let GO when you must.  Let them be, so you can be at peace. What else would you add to the list?  What should you NEVER have to give up for a relationship?  Leave a comment below and share your thoughts. Photo by: Vega "
"8 Things You Should NOT Do to Get Ahead|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/8-not-get-ahead.jpg?resize=500%2C298&ssl=1| What can you tell yourself that you don’t already know?  A whole lot. In the privacy of your mind you constantly talk to yourself.  Your inner monologue might seem pointless at times, but the truth is the act of talking to yourself can help you learn and maintain a positive lifelong trajectory.  Therefore, collected below are six effective topics for self-talk, so the next time you talk to yourself you will know exactly what to say. When it comes to lifelong labors and dreams, lukewarm is no good.  Hot is no good either.  White hot and passionate is the only way to work and live. Invest your thoughts and time in the things you love.  Don’t wait around for too long to get involved in something that moves you.  Realize how important it is to be an enthusiast in life.  If you are interested in something, no matter what it is, explore it.  Get up and go after it.  Embrace it, hug it, love it, and above all, let your passion flow freely. The most important decision you will ever make is what you do with the limited time that has been given to you.  Before you know it you’ll be asking, “How did it get so late so soon?”  So put your thoughts and time to good use, and let yourself be drawn to the strange pull of what you love – doing so will not lead you astray.  Live your life so that when you’re old, you never have to let the person you became fantasize about the person you were capable of being. Why worry about what others think of you?  Should you have more confidence in their opinions than you do your own? Truth be told, how others see you is not nearly as important as how you see yourself.  To be happy means to live confidently in your own skin – to be faithful to that which exists within you.  What you’re doing by being yourself is you’re keeping it real, and you’re being really brave. When you choose to stay true to YOU, some people might refuse to accept you for who you are.  Forget them.  Rather than being fake and incurring the pain and confusion of trying to be someone you’re not, choose to stand strong, even at the risk of incurring ridicule.  When you are comfortable in your skin, not everyone in this world will like you, and that’s perfectly OK.  You could be the ripest, juiciest apple in the world, and there’s going to be at least a few people out there who hate apples.  (Read The Untethered Soul.) When it comes to goal setting, you must be specific.  If you find yourself talking to yourself about wanting everything, it means you are treacherously close to achieving nothing.  It means you are avoiding the effort required to get anywhere at all. Usually, it’s not too difficult to decide what you want your life to look like in a year from now.  What is difficult is figuring out what you’re willing to give up in order to do the things that must be done to get to where you want to go. This takes serious commitment, and it requires transient discomfort.  When you decide to aim for something higher, you must be willing to suffer a bit of vertigo – the fear of falling.  And you must be willing to fight against that voice of emptiness below you which tempts and lures you to believe that you don’t have enough strength to ascend any higher. Sometimes the human mind operates in mysterious ways when it comes to achievements and happiness.  We dream of something and we wait and wait and feel like it’s taking forever to arrive.  Then it does and it’s over, and all we really want is to curl back up in that moment before things change again. Although there’s nothing wrong with enjoying a fulfilled dream, you must realize that it’s just one small moment of your life.  Like every other moment, this one instance of victory is fleeting.  Lifelong happiness is not found in any one particular moment, it’s found in all the moments and memories leading up to our inevitable sunset – all the small victories of each day that fall between the big events. Ultimately you will realize that your highest aspirations should just be a target – a point on the horizon to step towards.  You may not ever reach it, but you can always look up after every small step and see beauty of where that step has taken you.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the Happiness and Passion chapters of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Talk yourself into helping someone today. No exercise is better for your heart and mind than reaching down and helping others up.  Happiness and success in life doesn’t come through selfishness, but through selflessness.  Everything you do comes back around to you. The best way to feel alive is to get up and do something positive for someone else.  Don’t wait around for good things to happen in this world.  If you go out and make good things happen, you will fill the world with happiness and you will make yourself smile in the process. Greet people with positivity.  Encourage them.  Compliment them.  Lend them a helping hand.  Notice their progress, cheer them on and make them smile.  Love and kindness is contagious.  The more happiness and success you help others find, the more happiness and success you will find every single day of your life.  (Read The Happiness Project.) Right now, you have more than enough to be happy. Right now, you have the full capacity to find something small to celebrate. Right now, you have a choice to make. Don’t make the mistake of waiting on someone or something to come along and make you happy.  True happiness comes from within, when you choose not to allow another person or event to control your emotions, and when you choose to focus on what you have, not what you haven’t. One of the great secrets to happiness is to pay more attention to the beginnings than the endings.  So many people say they want a new life, but then they take the new one they get every morning for granted.  Don’t do this.  Don’t wait until your life is almost over to realize how great it has been.  A great life begins right now, when you stop wanting a better one. Scream it out loud:  “Life is good!” What have you been talking to yourself about lately?  Is it positive or negative self-talk?  What kind of positive self-talk do you use to motivate yourself?  What kind of negative self-talk do you need to stop?  Share your thoughts with us by leaving a comment below.

Everything you want is on the other side of fear.  Don’t ever hesitate to give yourself a chance to be everything you are capable of being. Although fear can feel overwhelming, and defeats more people than any other force in the world, it’s not as powerful as it seems.  Fear is only as deep as your mind allows.  You are still in control.  The key is to acknowledge your fear and directly address it.  You must step right up and confront it face to face.  This tactic robs fear of its power, instead of fear robbing YOU of… Fear of being different… Don’t be fooled by what others say, especially when they try to tell you what is right for you.  Listen and then draw your own conclusions.  What is your intuition telling you? There is not a clear path that everyone should follow.  Your greatest fear should not be of failure, but of succeeding in life at all the wrong things.  Choose a path that fits YOU.  Those who follow the crowd usually get lost in it.  Challenge yourself to ask with each and every step, and each focus point that consumes your energy: “Does this thing I’m doing right now truly serve me and those I care about in the next few minutes, few months, and few years?” Whatever you settle on, just make sure you don’t gain the whole world by losing your soul and purpose in the process.  (Read The Road Less Traveled.) Fear of not being good enough… Don’t be too hard on yourself.  There are plenty of people willing to do that for you.  Do your best and surrender the rest.  Tell yourself, “I am doing the best I can with what I have in this moment.  That is all I can ever expect of anyone, including me.”  Love yourself and be proud of everything you do, even your mistakes, because your mistakes mean you’re trying. If you feel like others are not treating you with love and respect, check your price tag.  Perhaps you subconsciously marked yourself down.  Because it’s YOU who tells others what you’re worth by showing them what you are willing to accept for your time and attention.  So get off the clearance rack.  If you don’t value and respect yourself, wholeheartedly, no one else will either. Fear of commitment… You cannot live your life at the mercy of chance.  You cannot stumble along with a map marked only with the places you fear, or the places you know you don’t want to revisit.  You cannot remain trapped, endlessly, in a state where you are unable to ask for directions, even though you’re terribly lost, because you don’t know your destination. You have to commit to goals that speak to you.  You have to stand up, look at yourself in the mirror, and say, “It isn’t good enough for me to know only what I DON’T want in life.  I need to decide what I DO want.”  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Goals and Success” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Fear of change and discomfort… As Thich Nhat Hanh so perfectly said, “People have a hard time letting go of their suffering.  Out of a fear of the unknown, they prefer suffering that is familiar.” In many cases you stay stuck in your old routines for no other reason than that they are familiar to you.  In other words, you’re afraid of change and the unknown.  You continually put your dreams and goals off until tomorrow, and you pass on great opportunities simply because they have the potential to lead you out of your comfort zone. You start using excuses to justify your lack of backbone:  “Someday when I have more money,” or “when I’m older,” or the over-abused “I’ll get to it as soon as I have more time.”  This is a vicious cycle that leads to a deeply unsatisfying life – a way of thinking that eventually sends you to your grave with immense regret.  Regret that you didn’t follow your heart.  Regret that you always put everyone else’s needs before your own.  Regret that you didn’t do what you could have done when you had the chance. Fear of facing inner truths… If you keep looking for happiness outside yourself, you will never find it.  Happiness is found from within.  What you seek is not somewhere else at some other time; what you seek is here and now, within you.  The more you look for it outside yourself, the more it hides from you. Relax, remember the source of your deepest desires, and allow yourself to know their fulfillment.  A choice, not circumstances, determines happiness.  Each morning when you open your eyes, say to yourself:  “I, not external people or events, have the power to make me happy or unhappy today.  It’s up to me.  Yesterday is gone and tomorrow hasn’t come yet.  I only have today and I’m going to be happy in it.”  (Read The Untethered Soul.) Fear of not being loved in return… Although it is nice when gestures of love are returned, true love is one-way traffic.  It’s a pure flow of giving and expecting nothing in return.  Anything else is a contract.  Notice how whenever you allow love to flow you are always clear, calm and strong.  It is only when the thought arises, “What have they given me in return?” that there is confusion and resentment.  Ego transacts, love transforms.  Life is too short for all these meticulous contracts and transactions. Look out for yourself by focusing your love in a direction that feels right to you, but once you decide to love, remain clear, remain bright, and remain strong.  Love without expectation.  Don’t let fear get in your way.  When the love you give is true, the people worthy of your love will gradually reveal themselves over time. Fear of being alone… Sadly, no matter how much love you give, some relationships simply aren’t meant to be.  You can try your hardest, you can do everything and say everything, but sometimes people just aren’t worth stressing over anymore, and they aren’t worth worrying about.  It’s important to know when to distance yourself from someone who only hurts you and brings you down.  When you give your love to someone, truly and purely without expectation, and it’s never good enough for them, there’s a good chance you’re giving your love to the wrong person. The bottom line is that long-term relationships should help you, not hurt you.  Spend time with nice people who are smart, driven and like-minded.  And remember, good relationships are a sacred bond – a circle of trust.  Both parties must be 100% on board.  If and when the time comes to let a relationship go, don’t be hostile.  Simply thank the relationships that don’t work out for you, because they just made room for the ones that will. Your biggest fears are completely dependent on you for their survival.  Every new day is another chance to change your life, and it’s way too short to let fear interfere.  Today, focus your conscious mind on things you desire, not things you fear.  Doing so can bring your dreams to life.

In other words, we forget to give thanks continuously, for all things.  Since every step we have taken has led us right to where we are, and all things have contributed to our development, when we finally do pause to give thanks, we try to include ALL things in our gratitude. So that’s what I want to reflect on today – a few quick reminders about some things you, too, likely forget to be grateful for… YOU are one of a kind.  You are lucky enough to have something that makes you different from everyone else.  Embrace your individuality.  Self-worth comes from one thing: thinking that you are worthy.  So appreciate what it feels like underneath your own skin.  You are amazing just the way you are. Too many days are wasted comparing ourselves to others and wishing to be someone or something we aren’t.  Every one of us has our own strengths and weaknesses, and it is only when you accept everything you are, and aren’t, that you will truly find the happiness and fulfillment you seek. Life isn’t about a single moment of great triumph and attainment.  It’s about the trials and errors that get you there – the blood, sweat, and tears – the small, inconsequential things you do every day.  It all matters in the end – every step, every regret, every decision, and every affliction. The seemingly useless happenings add up to something.  The minimum wage job you had in high school.  The evenings you spent socializing with coworkers you never see anymore.  The hours you spent writing thoughts on a personal blog that no one reads.  Contemplations about elaborate future plans that never came to be.  All those lonely nights spent reading novels and news columns and comics strips and fashion magazines and questioning your own principles on life and sex and religion and whether or not you’re good enough just the way you are. All of this has strengthened you.  All of this has led you to every success you’ve ever had.  All of this has made you who you are today.  (I’ve written about this extensively in the “Goals and Success” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Challenges are what make life interesting; working to overcome them is what gives life meaning. Failure and struggles keep you humble, success and achievement keep you glowing, but only faith and determination keeps you going.  So stay focused, and celebrate your efforts too, not just your outcomes. Remember that the opposite of failing is not succeeding; the opposite of failing is trying.  Your daily efforts are what make it all possible.  Appreciate what they teach you, even when they don’t lead you to an ideal outcome. In between all your goals, priorities, obligations, and everything else that might appear on one of your upcoming to-do lists, there are moments called “life” that still have to be lived and enjoyed. The trick is to make the very best of now, and value it for what it’s worth.  In other words, don’t wish all your time away by waiting for better times ahead.  Smile, right now, because you can.  (Read The Power of Now.) If you feel stressed and stuck, let go, take a deep breath and appreciate the fact that this moment is a new beginning.  Stop thinking about what might have been and starting looking at what can be.  Right now is a perfect time to start over.  This moment is a brand new opportunity to rebuild what you truly want. There are three little words that can release you from your past struggles and regrets and guide you forward to a positive new beginning.  These words are: “From now on…” As Cynthia Ozick once said, “We often take for granted the very things that most deserve our gratitude.” Have you ever noticed that the more familiar you become with an amazing person, a beautiful place, or an ideal situation in your life, the more you seem to take it for granted?  It’s like you somehow believe life is supposed to be this way – like it won’t ever change.  And most of the time, all the maintenance these wonderful things need is a little time, attention, and deliberate appreciation. So how often do you pause to appreciate your life and everyone and everything in it?  How often do you stop dead in your tracks and think, “Wow, thank you”? In other words, if you got sick today you could recover. Never underestimate the gift of your health.  It’s the greatest wealth you will ever own.  It’s the foundation for every chance at happiness and success life has to offer.  Your body is the only place you will truly ever live. Respect your body.  Eat well.  Sleep well.  Breathe deeply.  Move harmoniously.  Daily.  (Read Eat Right 4 Your Type.) Not only are you wealthy enough to be online right now, but you can read too. Believe it or not, only about one third of the world’s population has internet access.  And, even crazier than that, there are roughly 774 million people in the world who aren’t educated enough to read. YOU are one of the lucky ones. We all have a whole lot to be grateful for.  So at the end of the day before you close your eyes, smile and be happy with where you’ve been and grateful for what you have experienced and overcome. Life is rarely perfect, but it’s always pretty darn good. What would you add to the list? What do you sometimes forget to be grateful for?

It’s important to understand that love is not just about finding the right person, it’s about working with them to create the right relationship.  Marc and I have met and worked with couples at all ends of the spectrum over the years, and we’ve found that the happiest couples, or the unhappy couples who successfully turn things around, are able to create loving, lasting relationships by doing the following: Neglect based on lack of attention damages relationships far more often than malicious abuse.  There’s nothing more vital to the bond you share with someone than simply being there for them.  Too often we underestimate the power of a thoughtful question and a listening ear that’s fully present and focused.  Although it’s a simple act, it may very well be the most powerful act of caring – one which has the potential to turn a relationship around. When we pay attention to each other we breathe new life into each other.  With frequent attention and affection our relationships flourish, and we as individuals grow stronger.  This is the side effect of a good relationship – we help heal each other’s wounds and support each other’s strengths. Bottom line:  Stay in close touch with what’s going on in your partner’s life – communicate openly on a regular basis.  Not because it’s convenient, but because they are worth the extra effort. No matter how sure you are of someone’s love, it’s always nice to be reminded of it.  When you truly love someone, be loving in words and deeds every single day.  Don’t beat around the bush.  Be straightforward. If you appreciate someone today, tell them.  If you adore someone today, show them.  Hearts are often confused and broken by thoughtful words left unspoken and loving deeds left undone.  There might not be a tomorrow.  Today is the day to express your love and admiration.  (Read 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) The most important trip you will ever take in life is meeting your partner half way.  You will achieve far more by working with them, rather than working alone or against them.  That’s what healthy relationships are all about – teamwork.  It really is a full circle.  The strength of a relationship depends on the strength of its two members, and the strength of each member in the long run depends on the quality of the relationship. Anyone who helps you to make your half-hearted attempts more whole-hearted through passion, love and teamwork, is a precious friend and teacher, and thus makes a great partner.  Take the lead and BE this partner.  Make an effort to work closely with your significant other, and conquer the world together. Actions often speak much louder than words.  When you love someone you have to act accordingly.  They will be able to tell how you feel about them simply by the way you treat them over the long-term. You can say sorry a thousand times, or say “I love you” as much as you want, but if you’re not going to prove that the things you say are true, they aren’t.  If you can’t show it, your words are not sincere. And remember, it’s not so much about how much you do for your loved ones as it is about the love you put into what you do for them.  Learn what matters most to them and make a habit of it. All humans are imperfect.  At times, the confident lose confidence, the patient misplace their patience, the generous act selfish, and the knowledgeable second guess what they know. And guess what?  You’re human and so is your partner.  In fact, we all are.  We make mistakes, we lose our tempers, and we get caught off guard.  We stumble, we slip, and we spin out of control sometimes. But that’s the worst of it; we all have our moments.  Most of the time we’re remarkable.  So stand beside the people you love through their trying times of imperfection, and offer yourself the same courtesy; if you aren’t willing to, you don’t deserve to be around for the perfect moments either.  (Read The Mastery of Love.) What you focus on grows stronger in your relationships.  When you focus on a person’s wonderful qualities, you have a wonderful relationship with them.  When you focus on a person’s not so wonderful qualities, you have a not so wonderful relationship with them.  When you focus on benefits of a situation, you get to take advantage of them.  When you focus on the drawbacks, you gain nothing but a frown. The bottom line is that you see only what you want to see, and what you see determines the health of your relationships.  Your attitude is a little thing that makes a massive difference.  Don’t be the stubborn one who makes it a point to not see the good in your partner. Infatuating yourself with someone simply for what they look like on the outside is like choosing your favorite food based on color instead of taste.  It makes no sense.  It’s innate, invisible, unquantifiable characteristics that create lasting attraction.  There must be common ground in your interests and outlooks on life. Just as some people enjoy the smell of mint, while others prefer the scent of cinnamon, there is an undeniable, magnetic draw that attracts you to the qualities of certain people, places, and things.  Sometimes it’s even the scars your soul shares with them that reels you in and creates the very hinges that hold you together in the long run. If you’re disappointed with yourself or frustrated with your partner, the answer is not to take it out on the world around you.  Retribution, whether it’s focused on yourself or others, brings zero value into your life.  The way beyond the pain from the past is not with vengeance, mockery, bullying or retaliation, but with present love. Forgive the past, forgive yourself, forgive your partner, and love the present moment for what it’s worth.  There are plenty of beautiful things to love right now; you just have to want to see them.  Loving is never easy, especially when times are tough, yet it is easily the most powerful and positively enduring action possible. Let your partner in when you’re in a dark place.  Open up to them completely.  Don’t expect them to solve your problems; just allow them to face your problems with you.  Give them permission to stand beside you.  They won’t necessarily be able to pull you out of the dark place you’re in, but the light that spills in when they enter will at least show you which way the door is. Above all, the important thing to remember is that you are not alone.  No matter how bizarre or embarrassed or pathetic you feel about your own situation, your partner is in your life and has dealt with similar emotions and wants to help you.  When you hear yourself say, “I am alone,” it’s just your insecurities trying to sell you a lie.  (Read Daring Greatly.) It’s not about finding someone to lose yourself in, it’s about meeting someone to find yourself in.  When you connect with someone special, especially a lifelong partner, this person helps you find the best in yourself.  In this way, neither of you actually meet the best in each other; you both grow into your best selves by spending time together and nurturing each other’s growth. When you honestly think about what you and your partner add to each other’s lives, you will often find that instead of giving or taking things from each other (advice, answers, material gifts, etc.), you two have chosen rather to share in each other’s joy and pain, and experience life together through good times and bad.  No matter what, you two are there for one another, growing and learning as one. The best relationships are not just about the good times you share, they’re also about the obstacles you go through together, and the fact that you still say “I love you” in the end.  And loving someone isn’t just about saying it every day, it’s showing it every day in every way.

If so, it’s time to purge a few bad habits.  It’s time to learn from your mistakes rather than be conquered by them, and let your errors be of commission rather than omission. It’s time to cut out the habits that have been holding you back, change the tune, clean the house, and get rid of the dust and dirt.  Stop denying yourself a fair chance at a good life.  Stop being who you were, and become who you truly are. When you stop doing the wrong things, the right things start happening.  Take the following habits and flip the switch: Even if someone has known you for your entire life, it is impossible for them to know exactly what you’re thinking and feeling.  They can’t feel something for you or know exactly how your mind is processing thoughts.  They could invest every bit of their energy over the course of their entire lifetime in an attempt to achieve this understanding, but in the end they would fall short. This is precisely why you need to open up and speak your mind to a supportive confidant who will listen to you without judgment.  Only then will they get a momentary, unfiltered glimpse into your soul.  Only then will you feel the pressure of your thoughts subside. If you feel extremely stressed or even a bit depressed, then you’re likely feeling very alone.  It’s vital that you talk to someone who is sympathetic, whether this person is your spouse, parent, sibling, a good therapist, or just a trusted friend.  So many people suffer in silence and feel that they would be a burden to others if they spoke up about their troubling thoughts. Understand that your mental health is vital and everyone needs a helping hand and a listening ear sometimes.  In fact, helping one another is a big part of what makes us human, so opening up and asking for assistance is one way of enabling someone close to you to realize their own humanity. Be fair to yourself.  Perfectionism is a trap.  Your expectations need to expand and contract as circumstances in your life change.  When you learn to give yourself a break and feel okay about not being able to live up to impossible standards, then you can begin to get the worry-free rest your mind and body so badly need. You will always be perfectly imperfect just the way you are, wherever you are.  Instead of berating yourself for falling short, give yourself credit for making progress.  Grow as you go.  Let go of how things “should be” so you can see all the great possibilities in front of you. It’s also important to note that there’s no such thing as perfect happiness, just as there’s no such thing as perfect despair.  This is why trying to be perfect is an exercise in futility.  What does exist, however, is a continuous series of imperfect moments in your life filled with infinite possibilities and opportunities for you to interpret them and do with them as you please. You can pave the road you travel with doubt and despair or hope and happiness.  It’s your choice.  Either way, you will someday arrive at the same destination.  The only question is:  Do you want to arrive with a frown or a smile?  (Read The Happiness Hypothesis.) When you get too caught up in the busyness of your daily routine, you lose connection with the important people in your life, and yourself.  You end up filling all your waking hours, and then you fool yourself into believing you are relaxing when you’re merely moving from one of your daily labors to the next. Relaxation is the key to mental and physical recovery.  Stopping for a while and taking time to relax when you feel like things are getting out of control will gradually allow your mind and body to feel restored and reenergized again, thus allowing you to reconnect with the right inner mindset and the people and things that matter most to you. How do you relax?  There are many ways, but the foundation of all of them is focused breathing.  Your breath is the bridge between your life circumstances and your consciousness; it unites your body and your thoughts.  Whenever your thinking becomes scattered with the worries and stress of busyness, use your breath as the means to take hold of your thoughts again.  Just breathe, be present, and do your best with what’s in front of you. There’s a saying that the definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.  If you want to improve yourself, you have to try new things to see what works and what doesn’t. If you keep doing what you’re doing, you’ll keep getting what you’re getting.  Inspiration is great, but it must be met by dedicated action.  Changes must be invoked and implemented.  The difference between what is impossible and possible for you lies in what you do and how determined you are. Often the difference between a successful person and a person who struggles to implement positive changes is not one’s superior abilities, but the courage that one has to bet on one’s ideas, to take calculated risks, and to take steady steps forward.  In other words, some people sit and wait for the magic beans to arrive while the rest of us just get up and get to work. So ask yourself:  What’s going to be different today?  How do you want your life to be from here on out?  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Goals and Success” chapter of “1000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.”) Do you plan your days?  Did you wake up today knowing what you wanted to accomplish?  If not, maybe it’s time you do. The way you spend your time defines who you are.  You don’t get to choose how you are going to die or when; you can only decide how you are going to live right now.  Trust me, a year from now you will wish you had managed your time properly today. What would you regret not accomplishing this year?  What would you regret doing an abysmal job at, simply because you waited until the last minute and then rushed around doing 99 things at once?  Create a plan to accomplish these things and get started today. Planning doesn’t have to be long and tedious; it can just be a 60 second process.  Every night, think about a few small things that you want to accomplish tomorrow and write them down.  When you wake up the next morning, review this list before you do anything else, and then take the first step. Remember, we only have two choices when we wake up in the morning:  either we go back to sleep and dream, or we wake up and chase a dream.  In the end it doesn’t matter what you’re thinking, it matters what you’re doing.  Whatever you want to accomplish, it’s time to get started now. When life gets busy, it’s easy to put the most important people on the back burner, because you know they’ll wait for you.  Right? Wrong.  Your important relationships should be at the forefront of your priority list.  When we take things for granted, these things eventually get taken away.  Too often we don’t realize what we have until it’s gone.  Too often it seems we hurt the ones closest to us by letting less important things take precedence over them on a daily basis. Appreciate what you have, who loves you and who cares for you.  You’ll never know how much they mean to you until the day they are no longer beside you.  You know who these people are.  They’re the ones who are always there with you in spirit – the ones who leave footprints in your thoughts and dreams.  They are the glue that binds a smile to your soul.  Treat them as such.  (Read The Last Lecture.) The human body is the only machine for which there are no spare parts (unless you borrow them from someone else), so treat your body right.  Exercise to be fit, not skinny.  Eat to nourish yourself.  And always ignore the haters, doubters and unhealthy examples that were once feeding you. Staying in shape is simpler than most people make it.  Body fat is dictated by what you eat and your activity.  Working out affects two things mainly: fat and muscle.  Aerobic exercise burns fat and builds a little muscle.  Weight training builds muscle and burns a little fat.  In most cases, if you’re overweight you’re eating too much of the wrong stuff and/or not exercising enough. Also, keep in mind that your brain is part of your body too.  The human brain accounts for roughly 2% of the total mass of the human body, yet it consumes over 20% of the oxygen and nutrients the human body intakes.  So even if you don’t care what you’re body looks like, it makes sense to fuel your body with healthy food and keep your blood oxygen levels high with regular exercise. Bottom line:  Take good care of your body.  It’s the only place you will ever truly live. We all make choices, but in the end our choices make us.  Realize that you are only destined to become one person – the person you choose to be in this moment.  Do good and feel good.  Do bad and feel bad.  It’s that simple.  So don’t be afraid to make necessary changes and start over.  Right now is a brand new opportunity to choose differently and build what you truly want. What choices have been hurting your happiness?  What habits do you need to change?  Please leave a comment below and share a small piece of your story with us. Photo by: Paul G. "
"9 Things You Will Regret Not Doing Sooner|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/9-regret-not-doing.jpg?resize=500%2C313&ssl=1| “People always say life is too short for regrets.But the truth is, it’s too long.”?Sarah Addison Allen One of the most difficult things to deal with in life is regret.  Sometimes something will happen, and you will respond in the wrong way, and for a while thereafter you will wish you had done it differently.  But eventually, you accept the experience as a lesson learned and you move on with your life. This is hardly the worst kind of regret.  What could be worse? The chances you didn’t take.  The relationships you were afraid to nurture.  The decisions you waited too long to make.  The things you didn’t even try when you had the chance.  Those important words you left unspoken and deeds you left undone. The good news is, it’s not too late.  You are here breathing, which means you still have a chance to do what you might have done, and be what you might have been.  Right now you have an opportunity to write yourself a future free of regret. So take this opportunity and… The greatest miracle of your success in life will not be that you finished, it will be that you had the courage to begin. The feeling you get from taking the first step is far better than the feeling you get from sitting around thinking about it.  Get up and get moving.  Take the first step today – just one small step forward on that goal you’ve been meaning to work on. Even if you don’t feel 100% prepared right now, your worst try will always be 100% more effective than the person who never did.  It is so easy to get caught up in planning and perfecting that before you know it, you have made taking the first step a bigger deal than it is.  Sometimes you just have to go ahead and take things as they come, one step at a time. So give up the excuses and begin now.  Tomorrow you will be happy you started today. …and then take another step. You were not meant to sit at the edge of your comfort zone.  Not trying for fear of falling.  Not loving for fear of losing love.  Not speaking your truth for fear of what others will think.  Not looking at yourself in the mirror for fear of what you might see. Try, and then try again with all your might.  Your courage will unfold as your resolve takes hold.  And with each effort you make you will earn a little more confidence which you can use to acquire what no one else can give you: Your self-respect, and the life you were meant to live.  (Read Daring Greatly.) Focus enough energy inward.  Before befriending others, you have to be your own friend.  Before making others happy, you have to make yourself happy.  It’s not called selfishness; it’s called personal development. Even when you’re with others, you’re still with yourself.  When you wake up in the morning, you’re with yourself.  Laying in bed at night you’re with yourself.  Walking down the street at noon you’re with yourself.  What kind of person do you want to walk down the street with?  What kind of person do you want to wake up in the morning with?  What kind of person do you want to see at the end of the day before you fall asleep?  It’s your responsibility to be the person you want to be with. It’s important to nurture your relationships, and it’s important to start with YOU. For the average person happiness is a choice, yet so many of us are unhappy all the time.  There are many reasons, but it all boils down to one simple principle:  We often choose something else over happiness.  Because it often takes less effort to be unhappy.  For example, instead of seeking happiness we lazily follow the path of least resistance, we refuse to accept change, we aimlessly try to control the uncontrollable, and so on and so forth.  Averting these poor choices and the negative attitudes that accompany them is the first step. The second step is injecting meaning into your day-to-day life.  Franklin D. Roosevelt once said, “Happiness is not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort.”  To find true happiness in life you have to follow your heart and intuition.  You have to be who you are, and design a lifestyle and career that fulfills you – no matter what that entails or what people say about it.  And it is never too late to do so. Sure you have responsibilities.  And no, you won’t be able to do what you want to do every waking minute of your life.  But you almost always have a choice to do more of what you really want to do – to work on something that matters to you – something that moves you and gives your life meaning. Bottom line:  Life isn’t about pleasing everyone.  Begin today by taking full responsibility for your own happiness.  (Read 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) If I were to write a book entitled, “How to Be Amazing at Anything”, it would only contain a single page with one word on it: “Practice!”  Because that’s all it takes to be amazing. Whether it means learning to write by practicing writing or learning to live by practicing living, the principles are identical.  In each instance, it is the relentless routine of a precise set of actions, physical and intellectual, focused on a desired result.  Practice means to perform, over and over again in the face of all obstacles, some act of vision, faith, or desire. Practice is a means of inventing an amazing outcome in all walks of life. It’s not what you look at in life that matters; it’s what you choose to see.  The biggest wall you must climb is the one you have built in your mind.  If you don’t control your attitude, then it will control you. Negative feelings are like weeds; if you don’t fully extract their roots, they will keep coming back.  So take control of your attitude.  Look at what’s right.  Believe in yourself.  Ignore those who try to discourage you.  Avoid negative people, places, things, and habits.  Don’t give up, and don’t give in to consuming the garbage these negative sources are trying to feed you. Sure, there will always be problems and challenges, but there are always people willing to transform those problems and challenges into great opportunities.  Those who have the courage, commitment and discipline to do so, create a better life for everyone.  Be one of these people.  Focus on positive solutions and work your way eagerly toward a brighter future. Spending quality time smiling with family and friends, enjoying the antics of a pet, seeing your child or niece or nephew smile, experiencing intimate and heart-felt moments with your significant other – these times are priceless. So don’t get so caught up in the rat race, to the point where you are too stressed and exhausted to enjoy your closest relationships.  As we get older, fun with friends and family is often underrated.  With all of our responsibilities, spending time “playing” with the people closest to us seems like an indulgence.  It shouldn’t be.  It should be a requirement. Remember, we don’t live forever.  You must make an effort to appreciate what you have, who loves you and who cares for you, because you’ll never know how much they mean to you until the day they are no longer beside you.  Spend lots of quality time with the people you love.  Someday you will either regret not doing so, or you will say, “I’m glad I did.” Pause for a moment.  Breathe in slowly and deeply.  Exhale.  Feel the miracle of your breath.  And say, “Thank you.”  Be as grateful as possible, for small things, not just for big things – for the simple act of breathing, the time together, the conversations, etc. You probably woke up with a few aches and pains this morning, but you woke up.  You’ve seen better days, but you’ve also seen worse.  You might not have everything you want right now, but you have everything you need to move forward. Every moment counts.  Every second matters.  Whatever is given is a gift.  Right now life isn’t perfect, but it sure is good.  Acknowledging this is the foundation for all the happiness and abundance you seek.  (Read Buddha’s Brain.) Sometimes things won’t work out like you plan.  Life has other things in mind.  You need to let these things go.  Learn what you can and move along.  You can’t have a great day today if you’re still thinking and worrying about yesterday.  Whatever could have been or should have been, doesn’t matter.  This moment is here and now for you to live. It’s okay to not have all the answers yet.  In fact, you’ll never have ALL the answers.  Sometimes being strong and moving on are the only choices you have.  There are some things in life that you may never completely get over.  The best you may be able to do is get through them slowly, and that’s perfectly okay. Just continue the journey, focus on the present, do your best, and trust the process.  The struggle forward is worth the effort.  There’s still a lot of beauty left to be seen on the road ahead. Your future depends on what you do right now. Challenge yourself to be who you know you are capable of being.  Challenge yourself to follow through – to live what you preach, to walk your talk.  Don’t worry about how slowly you feel you’re heading towards your goals, or how many roadblocks you find, or how many detours you’re forced to take.  As long as you keep doing your thing, you’re still cruising far ahead of everyone who’s too scared to even try.

Photo by: Michael Phillips 10 Ways Happy People Prioritize Their To-Do Lists|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-happy-people-to-do.jpg?resize=500%2C355&ssl=1| “What can I start doing today to make my life happier and more fulfilling?” This is one of the most common questions readers ask us via email, blog comments, and social media.  So today I want to share some simple, actionable ways to improve your happiness and wellbeing on a daily basis. In the seven years of this blog’s existence, Angel and I have had the pleasure of meeting, coaching and interacting with hundreds of truly inspiring, happy, prolific people.  And the more we have interacted with people like this, the more we realize the similarities in how they prioritize their lives, and how their priorities align with our own. What becomes evident is that, to sustain happiness, we must focus our attention on the right things, in the right ways.  Every growing human being (that means all of us) has resource constraints: limited time and energy.  It is critical that we spend our resources effectively. Here are 10 ways to prioritize your life and your to-do lists for increased happiness and fulfillment: In other words, make the thing you have chosen to do the number one priority while you’re doing it.  Focus with your full attention.  See the value in where you are, while you’re there.  Enjoy what’s happening, while it’s happening. In the end, you will come to realize that the best days are the days when you don’t need anything extreme or special to happen to make you smile.  You simply appreciate the moments and feel gratitude, seeking nothing else, nothing more.  That is what true happiness is all about. Nurture your important relationships in such a way that when you tell the people you care about that you care about them, you’re simply reinforcing what they already know based on how you have prioritized them into your life. Give them your full attention.  Let them see their own beauty in your eyes.  Let them find their own voice through your listening ears.  Help them discover their own greatness in your presence. Make the people you love a top priority, always. As Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once said, “Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least.” Truthfully, the most important thing in life is knowing what the most important things in life are, and prioritizing them accordingly.  Sadly, most of us spend too much time on urgent things and not enough time on important things. So do yourself a favor and implement these three action steps every time you’re building or sorting your to-do list: Sometimes everything on your list will look important, which might be true to an extent.  But as you practice prioritizing, you will get better and better at it.  And eventually you will know, without question, when to set aside the important things in order to accomplish the vital ones, like spending quality time with loved ones.  (Read The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.) Getting anything worthwhile done is a matter of connecting with why you have chosen to do this thing in the first place. Don’t allow others to confuse you.  Don’t let them convince your heart what is right for you.  Your heart already knows.  Listen to it.  Don’t let anyone else dilute the power of your inner voice.  You’ve got to stand up for something specific, on your own two legs, or you will achieve nothing worthwhile in your own mind’s eye. Within you there is a formidable and undeniable sense of purpose.  Happiness comes from making a solid and persistent connection to that purpose.  When your intentions are supported by a “why” that has meaning, you will find the “how” to bring them to life. When it comes to tackling big projects, you can try to do everything yourself, or you can reach out and find the right people to help you.  The first choice will raise your stress and blood pressure; the second choice will raise your consciousness and effectiveness. Choosing the right perspective is so important; you CAN see life’s challenges as opportunities.  When an unexpected obstacle is suddenly standing in your way, don’t get overwhelmed.  Take a breather and regroup.  Someone else nearby knows how to get around it.  Find and engage them. For example, if your website is suddenly having glitches with a new web browser, don’t read a giant book on web design.  Hire a professional web designer.  See the problem as an opportunity to delegate.  Life is trying to teach you that most long-term, worthy endeavors are team efforts, and so much more palatable when shared with others.  Every unexpected obstacle in life is a lesson on teamwork in disguise, solvable with the right team of people. Regardless of what you’re trying to accomplish, it’s always easier if you have a group of people who understand what you’re doing, why you’re doing it, and what challenges you’re facing.  Staying in touch with these people and sharing ideas with them will accelerate your effectiveness and happiness.  Best selling author, Seth Godin, refers to these people as your tribe members. A tribe is a group of people connected to one another via an idea, movement or common goal.  For millions of years, human beings have been part of one tribe or another.  Godin says, “A group needs only two things to be a tribe: a shared interest and a way to communicate.” Every single one of us craves the feeling of being part of something bigger than ourselves.  By nature, we are tribal, but oftentimes we become disconnected from our tribe.  We know our people are out there – somewhere – but we feel lost and disconnected from them.  If you’re feeling disconnected, open up to your peers and initiate a conversation.  Tap into your tribe. In many ways, life is a circle – what you put in to it comes back around.  When you make a positive impact in the world, the world will have a positive impact on you. If you want to be rich, be generous.  If you want to make friends, be friendly.  If you want to be heard, listen.  If you want to be understood by others, take the time to truly understand them.  If you want to live an interesting life, be interested in the happenings around you. You won’t always get back exactly what you wanted or expected, but when you give what you can you almost always receive what you need.  (Read The Secret.) Let old problems remain where they belong – in the past.  No matter how many times you revisit the past, there’s nothing new to see.  Don’t let what once happened get in the way of what is happening.  Just because you’ve made mistakes doesn’t mean your mistakes get to make you.  If something important didn’t work yesterday, figure out what changes can be made today. Tame your inner critic; let go and move on productively.  You must make a conscious effort to do this, it won’t happen automatically.  You will have to rise up and say, “I don’t care how hard this is.  I don’t care how disappointed I am.  I’m not going to let yesterday’s problems get the best of me.  I’m taking the lessons and moving on with my life.” Whenever you catch yourself in a rambling bout of negative self-talk, stop and ask yourself, “If I had a friend who spoke to me in the same way that I sometimes speak to myself, how long would I allow this person to be my friend?” Remember, the way you treat yourself sets the standard for others, and the world at large, to follow.  Above everyone else, YOU deserve YOUR respect.  So make sure your decisions, behaviors and actions reflect your self-respect as you carry out your plans.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Things don’t always go as planned.  Good things can’t always be planned.  Be flexible and open to life’s twists and turns. Organize, but don’t agonize.  Keep your space and time ordered, but your schedule underbooked.  Create a foundation with a soft place to land, a wide margin of error, and room to think and breathe… Freeing yourself from an overbooked schedule lets you experience more of life’s good surprises, and also provides you with flexibility when the unforeseen disrupts your foresight. So, in summary… Focus on your priorities, but take things in stride.  Make decisions, not excuses.  Live one moment at a time.  Count your blessings, not your troubles.  Let the wrong things go.  Look for lessons in unforeseen obstacles.  Ask for help.  Give as much as you take.  Make time for those who matter.  Laugh when you can.  Cry when you need to.  And always stay true to your values. Which of the ten points above do you need to work on? What other happiness tips are on your to-do list? We would love to hear from you.  Please leave a comment below and share your thoughts and insights with the community.

That’s what this short article is about – how to live in such a way that you always get what you truly need. You can get almost everything in life you need if you simply help enough people around you get what they need.  The most prolific work is found in the challenge of helping someone who has less than you do.  It’s one of life’s great paradoxes; when you help others you end up benefiting as much if not more than those you have helped. If you feel stuck in your life because you have lost your direction, shift your focus from your circumstances to the circumstances of those around you.  As Gandhi once said, “The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.”  Instead of asking, “Why don’t I have what I need?” ask, “How can I help you get what you need?”  Find someone who could use an extra hand and make an offer they can’t refuse. Life is a circle – what goes around, comes around eventually.  Since so many people are out to only help themselves, when you genuinely seek to help others succeed in getting what they need, they will notice your presence.  These people will in turn fight to help you succeed in getting everything you need.  What you need becomes what they want most. Bottom line:  Live so that your life is not defined by what you have acquired, but by what you have given away… not by what is etched on a gravestone, but what is etched in the lives and hearts of those you have helped.  (Read The How of Happiness.) When deprived of passion and meaningful work, human beings lose their reason for living; they get lost and go frantically mad. Thus, a fulfilling life is lived by letting your interests and passions drive you forward, and then losing yourself in the journey of taking each required step. The same way your body responds to the right nutrients, your heart, mind and spirit also need nourishment.  You are able to get that nourishment when you indulge in meaningful work, because when you truly lose yourself in something that moves you, you will eventually find yourself there too. So never let the reality of what is, get in the way of what is possible.  Never give up on the things that make your heart skip a beat.  A focused human being driven by passion is always more powerful than the reality of the moment.  Express your love.  Live your truth.  Share your enthusiasm. Take action towards meaningful goals.  Walk your talk.  Embrace your gifts.  Bounce to the beat of your own drum.  Work on something worth remembering. What happens when people open their hearts and minds?  They experience.  They love.  They learn.  They grow.  That’s what vulnerability is – the openness to possibility.  Love is vulnerability.  Happiness is vulnerability.  The risk of being vulnerable is the price of opening yourself to beauty and opportunity. Being vulnerable is not about showing the parts of you that are polished; it’s about revealing the unpolished parts you would rather keep hidden from the world.  It’s showing up and letting yourself be fully seen.  It’s looking out into the world with an honest, open heart and saying, “This is me.  Take me or leave me.” The truth is, nothing worthwhile in this world is a safe bet.  Since love and happiness are born out of your willingness to be vulnerable, to be open to something wonderful that could be taken away from you, you must accept it.  Because when you hide from your vulnerability, you automatically hide from everything in life worth attaining. Be vulnerable.  Allow yourself to feel, to be open and authentic.  Tear down any emotional brick walls you have built around you and feel every unique emotion, both good and bad.  This is real life.  This is how you welcome new opportunities.  Vulnerability sounds like honesty and feels like courage.  Honesty and courage aren’t always the easiest choices, but they’re never the wrong ones.  (Read Daring Greatly.) Stop looking outside yourself for the answers.  Start asking yourself the right questions.  Voltaire once said, “Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers.”  This is such sound advice, because if you keep asking yourself the wrong questions, you will never get an answer you like. The questions you’re regularly exposed to have a powerful influence on the direction of your life.  And, not surprisingly, the questions you hear most often come directly from YOU.  What questions are you asking yourself?  Are they helping you better understand yourself?  Or are they sending you on a wild goose chase? The problem is that when you think you have to “look” for things in life like love, meaning, and inspiration, the “looking” implies that these things are somehow hiding behind some bushes somewhere, just waiting to be discovered.  So you start asking yourself questions that lead you further and further outside yourself, which is not where the answers you seek live. In life you have to create your own love, define your own meaning, and harbor your own inspiration.  This process starts on the inside, not somewhere else.  Much of this can be accomplished simply by asking yourself the right questions.  Start with these: Obviously, there are many other questions you can ask as well.  It’s all about self-inquiries that help you stay true to your principles, pursue your passions, grow through adversity, and add value to the world around you.  (Angel and I cover hundreds of important life questions as a theme that radiates through every chapter of our book, 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Whatever it is you need to achieve in life, take everything in stride, one tiny step at a time. Don’t build mountains in your mind.  Don’t try to conquer the world all at once.  When you seek instant gratification you make life unnecessarily painful and frustrating.  When you choose instead to treat each moment as an opportunity to make a small, positive, investment in the present moment, the rewards come naturally. Although each individual effort in each moment may seem to have an insignificant impact when you make it, at some point you’ll look back and realize the momentous impact these moments created once they were added together.  By moving at this sustainable pace, you’ll be able to continue moving forward for as long as it takes to get precisely where you need to go. Take a step now, then another, and keep on stepping.  You are responsible for getting what you need in life.  It always comes down to your actions in the present moment.  You choose: either action and results, or inaction and excuses.  You can’t have both. You may not feel like taking another step right now, and that’s fine.  Take a break, rest, and then take another step as soon as possible.  Know that the pain of discipline and persistence is far less than the pain of regret.  No one has ever given their needs their best shot and regretted it. What do we all need in life?  What are some other important steps that can help us get what we need?  Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

In other words, we forget to give thanks continuously, for all things.  Since every step we have taken has led us right to where we are, and all things have contributed to our development, when we finally do pause to give thanks, we try to include ALL things in our gratitude. So that’s what I want to reflect on today – a few quick reminders about some things you, too, likely forget to be grateful for… YOU are one of a kind.  You are lucky enough to have something that makes you different from everyone else.  Embrace your individuality.  Self-worth comes from one thing: thinking that you are worthy.  So appreciate what it feels like underneath your own skin.  You are amazing just the way you are. Too many days are wasted comparing ourselves to others and wishing to be someone or something we aren’t.  Every one of us has our own strengths and weaknesses, and it is only when you accept everything you are, and aren’t, that you will truly find the happiness and fulfillment you seek. Life isn’t about a single moment of great triumph and attainment.  It’s about the trials and errors that get you there – the blood, sweat, and tears – the small, inconsequential things you do every day.  It all matters in the end – every step, every regret, every decision, and every affliction. The seemingly useless happenings add up to something.  The minimum wage job you had in high school.  The evenings you spent socializing with coworkers you never see anymore.  The hours you spent writing thoughts on a personal blog that no one reads.  Contemplations about elaborate future plans that never came to be.  All those lonely nights spent reading novels and news columns and comics strips and fashion magazines and questioning your own principles on life and sex and religion and whether or not you’re good enough just the way you are. All of this has strengthened you.  All of this has led you to every success you’ve ever had.  All of this has made you who you are today.  (I’ve written about this extensively in the “Goals and Success” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Challenges are what make life interesting; working to overcome them is what gives life meaning. Failure and struggles keep you humble, success and achievement keep you glowing, but only faith and determination keeps you going.  So stay focused, and celebrate your efforts too, not just your outcomes. Remember that the opposite of failing is not succeeding; the opposite of failing is trying.  Your daily efforts are what make it all possible.  Appreciate what they teach you, even when they don’t lead you to an ideal outcome. In between all your goals, priorities, obligations, and everything else that might appear on one of your upcoming to-do lists, there are moments called “life” that still have to be lived and enjoyed. The trick is to make the very best of now, and value it for what it’s worth.  In other words, don’t wish all your time away by waiting for better times ahead.  Smile, right now, because you can.  (Read The Power of Now.) If you feel stressed and stuck, let go, take a deep breath and appreciate the fact that this moment is a new beginning.  Stop thinking about what might have been and starting looking at what can be.  Right now is a perfect time to start over.  This moment is a brand new opportunity to rebuild what you truly want. There are three little words that can release you from your past struggles and regrets and guide you forward to a positive new beginning.  These words are: “From now on…” As Cynthia Ozick once said, “We often take for granted the very things that most deserve our gratitude.” Have you ever noticed that the more familiar you become with an amazing person, a beautiful place, or an ideal situation in your life, the more you seem to take it for granted?  It’s like you somehow believe life is supposed to be this way – like it won’t ever change.  And most of the time, all the maintenance these wonderful things need is a little time, attention, and deliberate appreciation. So how often do you pause to appreciate your life and everyone and everything in it?  How often do you stop dead in your tracks and think, “Wow, thank you”? In other words, if you got sick today you could recover. Never underestimate the gift of your health.  It’s the greatest wealth you will ever own.  It’s the foundation for every chance at happiness and success life has to offer.  Your body is the only place you will truly ever live. Respect your body.  Eat well.  Sleep well.  Breathe deeply.  Move harmoniously.  Daily.  (Read Eat Right 4 Your Type.) Not only are you wealthy enough to be online right now, but you can read too. Believe it or not, only about one third of the world’s population has internet access.  And, even crazier than that, there are roughly 774 million people in the world who aren’t educated enough to read. YOU are one of the lucky ones. We all have a whole lot to be grateful for.  So at the end of the day before you close your eyes, smile and be happy with where you’ve been and grateful for what you have experienced and overcome. Life is rarely perfect, but it’s always pretty darn good. What would you add to the list? What do you sometimes forget to be grateful for?

"6 Things You Will Regret About Today|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/6-regret-about-today.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| “I have seen and touched and danced and sung and climbed and loved and meditated on a lifetime spent living honestly.  Should it all end tomorrow, I can positively say there would be no regrets.  I feel fortunate to have walked 90 years in my shoes.  I am truly lucky.  I really have lived 1,000 times over.” Those are the opening lines to one of the final entries in my grandmother’s journal – a 270-page, leather-bound journal she wrote small entries in almost every day during the final decade of her life.  When my grandmother passed on, she formally left her journal for me in her will.  Since then, I have read it from cover to cover countless times.  Although I have shared some of her insights and quotes with you before, the quote above is the only one I have printed out and hanging over my desk.  It reminds me to strive to end each day with no excuses, no false explanations, and no regrets. Over the course of our blog’s seven-year lifespan, Angel and I have received well over a thousand emails from readers who either have regrets or are fearful that they are leading a life that will ultimately lead to regret.  As we’ve read and responded to each of these emails over the years, it became clear to us that most people struggle with the exact same regrets.  In this post, I want to share six of these regrets with you – the ones that seem, by a long shot, to be the most popular among our readers – and examine some ideas on how to avoid their grief. Sometimes you will not be able to see where you are going; every step will seem uncertain.  But know that as long as you follow your intuition and take baby steps, your soul’s inner GPS will guide you home.  You will find that you will be the right person, at the right place, at the right time, doing the right thing on point.  Trust your instincts.  Relax.  You know what to do.  Living is about learning as you go. Living is risky business.  Every decision, every interaction, every step, every time you get out of bed in the morning, you take a small risk.  To truly live is to know you’re getting up and taking that risk, and to trust yourself to take it.  To not get out of bed, clutching to illusions of safety, is to die slowly without ever having truly lived. If you simply ignore your feelings and let uncertainty win, you will never know anything for sure, and in many ways this unknowing will be worse than finding out your hunch was wrong.  Because if you were wrong, you could make adjustments and carry on with your life without ever looking back and wondering what might have been.  (Read Uncertainty.) Well, it’s true, you have failed and you have been hurt… perhaps quite a bit.  But it’s also true that you have loved, and been loved.  That you have risked, and received.  That you have grown not just older, but wiser every day.  And all of this carries a weight of its own – a greater weight than any particular failure or wound.  Think of your whole life as a giant pie chart.  In the end, you will look back on your life and see that the greatest portion of it was spent living, loving, and learning through unanticipated, priceless experiences.  The problems, the failures, the sadness… these things are part of the pie, but they are just small slivers that led to the bigger slices of life. What you need to realize is that we all do things we desperately wish we could undo.  These feelings of regret just become part of who we are, along with everything else.  To spend time trying to change the past, is to waste all of the present and future.  Forget the failures of the past and focus on the present opportunities.  It’s better to have a life full of small failures that you learned from, rather than a lifetime filled with the regrets of never trying. Have you ever seen a toddler learn to walk?  They stumble and fall numerous times before getting it right.  Mistakes are learning opportunities.  It takes failure after failure to create success.  So don’t let time pass you by like a hand waving from a train you desperately want to be on.  Don’t spend the rest of your life thinking about why you didn’t do what you can do right now. Get your priorities straight.  Twenty years from now it won’t really matter what shoes you wore today, how your hair looked, or what brand of jeans you bought. What will matter is how you lived and loved, what you learned, and how you applied this knowledge. So forget about impressing everyone else.  Be real instead. If you want to impress someone, impress yourself by making progress on something you’re sincerely proud of.  It’s truly amazing what you can accomplish in a day when you aren’t constantly worried about what everyone else in the world thinks. All those important words you have kept to yourself… They are bottling up inside you! Is it really possible to tell someone what you feel?  Yes, it is.  They won’t always understand, because even when they have heard you, they can’t feel exactly what you feel inside.  But you still have to speak up, for your own peace of mind. If you appreciate someone today, tell them.  If you have something to say, say it now.  Hearts are often confused and broken by words left unspoken.  There might not be a tomorrow.  Today is the day to express your love, your feelings, and your message to the world.  Communicate on your own terms, with your own words, and get your thoughts out there. And again, remember, no matter how cautiously you choose your words, someone will always twist them around and misinterpret what you say.  So just say what you need to say.  In order to be fully expressed and free of regret, you must lose your fear of being judged.  (Read Daring Greatly.) Some people frantically seek a defined state of success as though their entire self-worth depends on whether or not they make it to the top – of their company, industry, niche, etc.  Their goals and efforts are wound tight around stringent routines that they repeat every single day of their lives, without stopping to breathe.  And in the process, they forget about every other dimension of their life – the passions, hobbies, and activities that make them smile. Franklin D. Roosevelt once said, “Happiness is not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort.”  With the modern 8-to-5 work schedule it’s so easy to trap yourself into doing what you don’t want to do for 40+ hours every week and then mindlessly wasting all your free time being lazy. Sure you have responsibilities.  And no, you won’t be able to do what you want to do every waking minute of your life.  But you always have a choice to do more of what you really want to do – to work on something that matters to you – something that moves you and makes you smile.  Make time for YOU too. When you don’t talk enough with your the people you love, there’s a lot of beautiful stuff that ends up not getting said.  When you don’t spend enough time with the people you love, there’s a lot of beautiful emotion that ends up not being felt. As we get older, social fun is often underrated.  With all of our big responsibilities, socializing seems like an indulgence.  It shouldn’t be.  It should be a requirement.  When your work life is busy, and all your energy is focused in that arena, it’s all too easy to find yourself off balance.  While drive and focus is important, if you intend to maintain happiness and peace in your life you still need to balance in the soccer games, the family dinners, the intimate dates with your significant other, and the outings with your closest friends. Nurture your important relationships so that when you tell the people you love that you love them, it’s merely a ritualistic validation of what you have already shown them by how you have prioritized them into your schedule every day.  (I’ve written about this extensively in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) One day, many moons from now, you will find yourself close to the end, and thinking about the beginning. TODAY is that beginning.  TODAY is life.  You’ve got to live it. Live for what’s right.  Live for what you believe in.  Live for what’s important to you.  Live for the people you love, and never forget to tell them how much they mean to you.  Realize that today you’re lucky because you still have a chance.  So stop for a moment and think.  Whatever you still need to do, start doing it now.  There are only so many todays left. Asking you a question like, “What will you regret most about today?” is an obvious way to end this post.  But I want to flip your perspective instead.  So tell me… What’s one thing you CAN do today that you know you will NOT regret?

Wisdom, after all, is not about knowing all the answers every minute; it’s about asking the right questions.  In the long run, the simple questions you ask yourself on a regular basis will determine the type of person you become. At the very least, you need to set aside some dedicated “me time” at the end of each week – a personal timeout for self-reflection and self-inquiry – to ask yourself questions like these: Life’s dynamic nature continually renews the possibilities before you; you honestly never can be certain when the next gust of wind will arrive and what it will blow in your direction.  Open yourself to these surprises and pay attention.  Many of them will bring goodness you never knew you were missing. Some of your best discoveries will likely come when you least expect them, in places you never even thought to look.  What you were not looking for can end up being more than you ever hoped to find.  So seek your goals and dreams diligently, but don’t be so unyielding that you develop tunnel vision.  Do not blind yourself from all the unpredictable wonders and opportunities passing in your periphery. You are never too old, too young, too busy, or too educated to find value and joy in new, unexpected opportunities.  So stay on the lookout, and keep track of these pleasant surprises.  Be sure not to lose them in the haste of your weekly routines. This question will help you clarify the distinction between activity and achievement.  There will always be routines and mundane tasks that require you to go through the motions, but what else did you derive from your work this week?  What was learned that could be built upon?  Surely there were successes and failures – ideas that worked and those that wallowed.  Think about these events and extract what is useful. Look at your week from beginning to end.  It was not a week of lounging around doing nothing; it was a week in which you had everything to do, and now you have done it.  Pat yourself on the back, and then acknowledge the week’s lessons – especially the things that didn’t go your way.  If you didn’t get a task done the way you had hoped or a particular solution didn’t work, it only means something better is out there waiting for you next week.  And the lessons you just learned are the first step towards it.  (Read Decisive.) It’s not what you do or achieve every once in awhile (big picture), but what you do every day (small picture) that counts.  Dream big dreams, but realize that short-term, realistic goals are the key to success.  What you want to achieve is directly connected to your daily actions.  The way you spend your time defines who you are and who you will become. Therefore, make sure what you are doing (small picture) truly aligns with where you want to go (big picture). While the pleasure junkies of the world avoid pain and discomfort at all costs, be someone who truly understands the value and benefits of working through the tough situations that others typically avoid.  Be willing to sacrifice short-term pleasure for long-term happiness.  Be more interested in something being effective than you are in something being easy.  While everyone else is looking for the quickest shortcut, look for the course of action that will produce the real results you want for yourself. As Stephen Covey once said, “Most of us spend too much time on what is urgent and not enough time on what is important.”  In other words, productivity is not just about getting things done, it’s about getting the right things done. At the end of each week, look at how you have spent your time, and adjust the allocation as necessary for the upcoming week.  Do your best to get rid of your schedule’s complexities so you can spend more time on the things that matter.  This means fine-tuning and eliminating all but the essential tasks, so you are left with only the ones that add value to your life.  And above all, know when to set aside the important things for the vital things, like family.  (Read The Power of Habit.) Not knowing which path to take can be painful, but nothing is more disheartening than standing still and never making a decision at all.  This is why it’s imperative to think about your fears and address them on a weekly basis.  You have to stop them so they don’t stop you from moving forward with your life. So what should you do?  Anything… something small… so long as you don’t simply sit there.  If you make a mistake, start over.  Try something else.  If you wait until you’ve satisfied all the uncertainties in your mind, it may be too late. The bottom line is that you gain strength, confidence and emotional growth by living through every experience in which you are forced to stop and look fear in the face.  And once the face-off is over and you realize you’re still breathing, you must say to yourself, “I have lived through period of uncertainty, I have learned from it, and I am better off.  AND I am capable of dealing with the next intimidating circumstance that comes my way too.” Just as you don’t move from one place to another without first sorting your belongings, and leaving behind what is not useful or needed, so too should you follow the same process with what you’ve mentally gathered, before moving on.  Do some purging and clear some clutter.  Don’t carry excess baggage into next week.  Eliminate the unnecessary so the necessary may shine bright. Throw away any regrets, shame and anger that you have accumulated this week, and take only the treasures worth keeping: the lessons, the love and the best of what can be remembered. One of the easiest ways to sort through your mental clutter, and decide what needs to be discarded, is to perform a simple brain dumping exercise whereby you dump your emotions into a written journal or notepad.  Literally think about this week’s standout moments, make a list of how you felt on each occasion, and then review your findings.  Clear out the negative clutter that’s lingering in your mind by processing your thoughts, filing the lessons, forgiving yourself, forgiving others, and letting this week go. The bottom line is that you have to close the door on this week’s negativities, change the record, clean the house, and get rid of the mental dust and dirt.  Don’t deny yourself a fair chance at the week ahead.  Stop holding on to what was, so you can enjoy what is beginning now.  (I discuss this in more detail in the “Simplicity” and “Success” chapters of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Next week is a new beginning – a blank canvas upon which you have the delightful opportunity to create.  On Monday morning you will be standing at the start of an impressive adventure, with the very real and present opportunity to shape your present and future in exactly the way you see fit. And as they say, well begun is half done… What would you add to the list? Please leave a comment below and share your insights with us. Photo by: Lauren Rushing One Lesson on Regret Most People Learn Too Late|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/lifes-biggest-regrets.jpg?resize=500%2C375&ssl=1| 6 Reasons Your Relationship is Suffering|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/9-relationship-suffering.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| “Every relationship needs an argument every now and then.  Just to prove that it is strong enough to survive.  Long-term relationships, the ones that matter, are all about weathering the peaks and the valleys.”?Nicholas Sparks At some point we all get involved in a serious relationship, be it falling in love with a significant other, or simply establishing an amazingly close friendship.  As soon as this relationship is in place, both parties must do their part to nurture it.   When they fail to do so, solidarity is gradually replaced with suffering. Although I sincerely hope your closest relationships are not suffering, if you have found yourself in this kind of predicament (as we all do sometimes), chances are the problem can be traced back to one or a few causes.  If your relationships are all rainbows and butterflies right now, consider yourself lucky – this list will simply provide some good food for thought. You don’t love and appreciate someone because they’re perfect, you love and appreciate them in spite of the fact that they are not.  “Perfection” is a deadly fantasy – something none of us will ever be.  So beware of your tendency to “fix” someone when they’re NOT broken.  They are perfectly imperfect, just the way they should be. Truthfully, the less you expect from someone you care about, the happier your relationship with them will be.  No one in your life will act exactly as you hope or expect them to, ever.  They are not YOU – they will not love, give, understand or respond like you do. The biggest disappointments in life and in relationships are the result of misplaced expectations.  Tempering unrealistic expectations of how something or someone “should be” will greatly reduce unnecessary frustration and suffering.  (I’ve written about this extensively in the “Relationships” chapter of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.”) When we’re feeling incomplete, we tend to go out looking for somebody else to complete us.  Initially we meet someone who’s compatible with us and they distract us from our deficiency, at least for a while.  Then a few months or years into the relationship, we find that we’re still feeling incomplete, so we blame our friend or lover.  It feels like they’ve changed, but in reality they haven’t; they’ve just become less of a distraction to our own growing, inner void. Ultimately what you need to realize is that while a close friend or lover can add beautiful dimensions to your life, YOU are responsible for your own fulfillment.  Only you can complete yourself.  Nobody else can provide your missing pieces, and to believe otherwise is to succumb to a lifetime of feeling broken, as every relationship you enter eventually ends in hopeless disappointment. Perhaps there’s something that really bothers you about your friend or lover.  Why aren’t you saying something?  Are you afraid they’ll get upset?  Maybe they will and maybe they won’t.  Either way you need to deal with it upfront, constructively, and avoid burying it until it worsens, festers and explodes out of you. Great communication is the cornerstone of a great relationship.  If you have resentment, you must talk it out rather than let the resentment grow.  If you’re feeling jealous, you must communicate in an open and honest manner to address your insecurities.  If you have expectations of your friend or lover, you must communicate them clearly.  If there are any problems whatsoever, you must get them out of your head and into the open so they can be worked out. Information is the grease that keeps the engine of communication running.  Always give the important people in your life the information they need to understand you.  And communicate more than just problems – communicate the good things too.  Share what you love about your friend or lover.  Share what is going on in your mind and heart.  Share your deepest thoughts, needs, wishes, hopes and dreams.  (Read The 5 Love Languages.) Anything is better than lies.  They are like a cancer in the heart and soul.  They eat away what is good and leave only decay and devastation behind.  If you spend your life learning to lie to the people around you, not only will you hurt and deceive them, you will also hurt and deceive yourself – you will forget your own truth. There is perhaps no phenomenon that is more destructive to a relationship than dishonesty, which permits envy, hate and deception to be acted out under the guise of love and virtue.  Even the smallest, seemingly innocent lies eventually snowball into larger issues.  Stand by the whole truth – your truth – always.  If you say you’re going to do something, DO IT!  If you say you’re going to be somewhere, BE THERE!  If you say you feel something, MEAN IT!  If you can’t, won’t and don’t, then DON’T LIE. It’s always better to tell the whole truth up front.  Don’t play games with the minds and hearts of others.  Don’t tell half-truths and expect your friends or lover to trust you when the full truth comes out; half-truths are no better than lies. Remember, love and friendship don’t hurt.  Lying, cheating and messing with people’s feelings and emotions hurts.  Honesty is the healing remedy. Presence is complete awareness, or paying full attention to “the now.”  If you do not find at least some amount of presence in the moments you share with those you care about, it is impossible to listen, speak, compromise, or otherwise connect with them on a meaningful level. Presence is looking inward and learning how to be with yourself, in the moment, see the gears turning, embrace what’s in your immediate vicinity, and thereby put space around destructive thoughts of other times and places, as you apply your full energy to the “here and now.”  The idea is that you must first attend to the reality of the moment before you can effectively contribute anything positive to it. Simply being completely present with someone else is difficult because it requires you to share yourself completely, vulnerabilities and all, and enter a moment of unguarded honesty with this person. To cultivate your presence, all you need to do is sit quietly for as long as you desire and put your full attention on your breath – thinking only of what each inhale and exhale feels like.  Don’t judge or resist your inner-workings.  Simply accept and breathe.  Practice this a few times a day, and it will start to feel more natural.  This way, when you are in the thick of a deep conversation with a friend or partner, you can access that presence and listen without judgment or impatience, speak with clarity, and learn to fully connect and compromise. Bottom line:  Be Present.  Give the people you care about your full attention.  Let them see they’re own beauty in your eyes.  Let them find their own voice through your listening ears.  Help them discover their own greatness in your presence.  (Read The Power of Now.) There are certain people who aren’t meant to fit into your life in the long-term no matter how much you want them to.  They pass through your life in a shorter time frame than you had hoped to teach you things they never could have taught you if they stayed. So many people think friends or lovers have to be the perfect fit, because that’s what everyone tells you to want – that’s the Hollywood love story.  Of course, it’s nice when relationships stay healthy and last, but that doesn’t mean your failed relationships aren’t equally as important.  Some people you engage with will be like a mirror – people who show you things that are holding you back, people who show you the ways that don’t work, people who bring your insecurities and misjudgments to your own attention so you can change your life. It’s these people – the ones who come into your life for a short time and teach you a priceless lesson – that are some of the most important people you will ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you until you’re wide awake. Do you want to live with these people in your life forever?  No way – that would be way too painful!  They come into your life to shake you up, tear apart your ego, flip your perspective, show you your obstacles, break your heart and mind open so new rays of light can shine in, just to reveal another layer of YOU to yourself, and then they move on like they’re supposed to. Take their lessons as gifts and be sure you move on too. What would you add to the list?  Why do some good relationships go bad?  Please leave a comment below and share your insights with us.

"8 Things Happy, Successful People Never Say|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/8-happy-successful-say.jpg?resize=500%2C267&ssl=1| That’s what careless words do…They make you love life a little less. How well have you chosen your words?  Have you put them to positive or negative use?  If I eavesdropped on your self-talk, or your conversations with others, would I hear statements that create happiness or statements that refute it? Words are powerful.  They can create or they can destroy.  Even the small words you whisper under your breath can be the ones to hurt you, or save you.  Your ability to write a happy life story hinges on your language.  It is your inner and outer verbal expression that makes your joy possible and that infuses your life with purpose and vitality. Today, I challenge you to choose your words wisely.  It’s time to STOP saying… To accomplish great things, you must not only act, but also dream, not only plan, but also believe.  Be a dreamer, a believer, and a courageous and cheerful thinker.  Be a positive motivator, a productive doer, and a go-getter who keeps her head in the clouds and her feet on the ground.  Let the spirit of passion and possibility ignite a fire within you to do something worthwhile today, and don’t forget to spread your enthusiasm to those around you. There’s no excuse for being an amateur forever.  Life is short.  The day is rapidly approaching when the risk to remain perched in your nest is far more detrimental than the risk it takes to fly.  Fly!  Spread your wings.  Start now.  What a disgrace it would be for you to grow old without ever seeing the beauty and strength of your full potential. Be bold enough to use your voice, brave enough to listen to your heart, and strong enough to live the life you’ve always imagined.  And remember, people are going to talk regardless of what you do or how well you do it.  So worry about yourself before you worry about what others think. William James once said, “When you have a choice to make and you don’t make it, that in itself is a choice.”  Nothing could be closer to the truth. Ultimately, life has no meaning; you have a meaning and you bring it to life.  It is a waste to always be questioning yourself when you are the answer.  Until you can look at yourself in the mirror and honestly say, “I have a choice.  I am here now because of the choices I’ve made in the past,” you will never be able to say, “I choose differently.” You’re choosing, all day, every day.  If you’re struggling at a job you don’t love, look at it this way: you’re choosing to make a living to pay your mortgage, support your family, and fuel your dreams.  Don’t resist it; own it – that’s where your power is.  If you’re in a relationship that’s causing you pain, you’re choosing to be in it.  Maybe staying will lead to essential growth or a breakthrough or a deeper understanding of love.  Or not.  But you’re choosing to be in or out, right now.  Whichever you choose, own it – that’s where your power is.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Happiness” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Don’t allow others to confuse you.  Don’t let them convince your heart what is right for you.  Your heart already knows.  Listen to it.  Don’t let anyone dilute the power of your inner voice.  You’ve got to stand up for something specific, on your own two feet, or you will achieve nothing worthwhile in your own mind.  Within you there is formidable and undeniable sense of purpose.  Happiness comes from making a solid and persistent connection to that purpose.  When your intentions are supported by a “why” that has meaning, you will find the “how” to bring them to life. Bottom line:  What’s right for you may be wrong for others, and vice versa.  The truth is that the world isn’t really as it is, but as we see it.  And we all see it differently.  So don’t be scared to step out of line.  It’s OK to go off the beaten path, as long as you know why going a different way is right for you.  Some people may resent the freedom that you create in your life when you choose to be true to yourself.  If you come across these people, ignore them and carry on. The worst obstacle in life is a bad attitude.  Remember, it’s not what happens to you, but how you respond to what happens to you.  You can’t let one bad moment spoil a bunch of good ones.  Don’t let the silly little dramas of each day get you down.  Smile, even when it feels like things are falling apart.  Smiling doesn’t always mean you’re happy; sometimes it just means you’re strong. Likewise, do not let the negative opinions of others derail you.  Throughout your life you will meet two kinds of people: those who are a drain on your energy and try to derail your dreams, and those who give you the energy to pursue your dreams.  Ignore the first kind and cherish the second.  People that doubt, judge, and disrespect you are not worth your time and attention.  (Read The Four Agreements.) As Martin Luther King Jr. so profoundly said, “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.  Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”  Truth be told, when we harbor feelings of hate, it eventually gets the best of us.  Everything and everyone you hate rents permanent space in both your head and heart.  So if you want to eliminate something or someone from your mind, don’t hate.  Instead, disconnect yourself, move on, and don’t look back. And remember that getting even doesn’t help you get ahead.  You will never get ahead of anyone as long as you try to get even with them.  Sometimes we don’t forgive people because they deserve it; we forgive them because they need it, because we need it, and because we cannot move forward without it.  To forgive is to rediscover the inner peace and purpose that at first you thought someone took away when they betrayed you. Yes you CAN!  Stop stressing over what could have been, because the chances are if it should have been, it would have been.  You may feel discouraged.  You may feel upset.  You may feel too old.  You may be sick.  You may be divorced.  You may be unemployed.  You may be financially strapped.  You may be… etc.  But you’re not dead – YOU ARE ALIVE.  Your journey is far from over. Forget about how you thought things were supposed to be.  Just because some things didn’t work out as you had expected, or didn’t happen as fast as you thought they would, is no excuse to give up on yourself.  Time passes one way or the other.  Do what you need to do so that, at the very least, you can look back someday and say, “I gave life my best shot.”  (Read You Can Heal Your Life.) Nothing is permanent in this crazy world, not even your mistakes, failures, or troubles.  So laugh at the confusion, live consciously in the moment, and enjoy your life as it unfolds.  You might not be exactly where you had intended to go, but you are precisely where you need to be to take the next best step forward. As Maria Robinson once said, “Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending.”  This is your life; shape it, or someone else will try for you.  Strength shows not only in the ability to hold on, but in the ability to start over when you must.  It is never too late to become what you might have been.  Keep learning, adapting, and growing.  You may not be there yet, but you are closer than you were yesterday. A great deal of unhappiness comes into the world because of confusion, bewilderment, and things left unsaid.  Many times in life I’ve regretted the things I’ve said without thinking.  But I’ve never regretted the things I said nearly as much as the words I’ve left unspoken. Speak up.  Don’t hide your thoughts and feelings, especially when you can make a difference.  Be brave.  Say what needs to be said.  When you don’t communicate effectively with those around you, there’s a lot of important stuff that ends up not getting said and a lot of beautiful emotion that ends up not being felt.  There’s no greater sadness than holding on to the words you never had the courage to speak. What would you add to the list?  What’s something you should NOT say if you want to increase your potential for happiness and success?  Leave a comment below and share your thoughts. Photo by: David Kracht 7 Stressful Things to Start Ignoring|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-stressful-ignoring.jpg?resize=500%2C407&ssl=1| Life is too short to stress yourself with things thatdon’t even deserve to be an issue in your life. When I was nine-years-old, my dad came into my room one Sunday afternoon with teary eyes and told me that we might lose our house.  He explained that he had been struggling to find a job, and if he didn’t find one soon we would not be able to afford to live in our house anymore.  I could tell he was sad, angry, and worried all at once.  Without thinking about it, I hugged my dad and said, “It’s just a house.  I don’t care where we live, as long as we’re together.” My dad, who’s now 70, loves to reminisce about this story.  He says my innocent, sincere response brought perspective to the stressful predicament our family was facing at the time.  Suddenly, he realized the sky wasn’t falling.  We were all healthy and capable of getting through this together.  And we did. As we journey through life, so many of us let stress get the best of us.  Don’t let this happen to you.  Don’t let your mind stir up and put up with unnecessary drama.  Do your best, take small steps forward, keep things in perspective, and ignore the following… Keep calm and think positively.  Evolve your being and inspire yourself and others.  Say it out loud, “I am sorry negativity, I have no time for you.  I have far too many positive things to do.”  Take the next 24 hours and every time you start to complain, realize it, admit it and stop it.  How often do you complain and harp on negative thoughts?  It may be more often than you think.  Know that bringing awareness to this unproductive habit is the first step to overcoming it.  You are not allowed to complain about something unless you’re going to do something about it. It’s better to be a lion for a day than a sheep all your life.  Instead of complaining about your circumstances, get busy creating new ones.  Remember that stumbling blocks become stepping stones when you look for the positive in a situation, even if you have to look a little harder than usual.  Be thankful for the little struggles you go through today.  They make you stronger and wiser.  Don’t let them break you; let them make you. And when it comes to your interactions with negative people…  Smile, even if you have to force it.  Laugh, even if it hurts.  Don’t let them get to you.  You are amazing and life is good, regardless of what others say.  Those who talk down to you are just trying to walk tall by making you feel small.  Rise up.  If someone has nothing nice to say, ignore them. When you follow your heart and intuition, someone will try to discredit you for it.  When you finally find something that makes you happy, not everyone will be happy for you.  When you show unwavering kindness to others, some people will question your motives.  When you are honest to the core, some folks will attempt to use your honesty against you.  When you look for the best in everyone you meet, a few of them will take advantage of it. Don’t let any of these people stop you from doing these things.  These people don’t matter.  In the end, what does matter is how you feel about yourself and the life you have led.  You will ask yourself one question: “Am I proud of how I lived?”  Make the answer: “Yes!”  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) You can’t always be agreeable; that’s how people take advantage of you.  You have to set boundaries.  Don’t ever change just to impress someone.  Change because it makes you a better person and leads you to a better future.  Being your true self is the most effective formula for happiness and success there is. Truth be told, one of the greatest freedoms is simply not caring what everyone else thinks of you.  Take risks.  Follow your intuition.  Don’t just accept the safe and easy choices because you’re afraid of what others might think or say.  Sometimes you need to step outside, get some fresh air, and remind yourself of who you are and what you want to be.  You have to take a stand and do your own thing your own way, no matter what anyone else thinks or says about you.  Don’t let small minds convince you that your dreams are too big.  They aren’t. The quest for perfection always ends in devastation.  Thinking you have to do things perfectly is like strapping an extra 500 pounds to your back – it absolutely crushes you.  According to research professor, Brené Brown, “Perfection is correlated with depression, anxiety, addiction, and life paralysis or missed opportunities.  The fear of failing, making mistakes, not meeting people’s expectations, and being criticized keeps us outside the arena where healthy competition and striving unfolds.” You might not be the most beautiful, the strongest, or the most talented person in the world, and that’s OK.  Don’t pretend to be someone you’re not.  You’re great at being YOU.  You might not be proud of all the things you’ve done in the past, but that’s okay too.  The past is not today.  Be proud of who you are, how you’ve grown, and what you’ve learned along the way. Ultimately, you need to realize that perfect is the enemy of great.  And the real world doesn’t reward perfection; it rewards people who get great things done.  And the only way to get great things done is to be imperfect 99.9% of the time.  (Read Daring Greatly.) When life is good, enjoy it.  Don’t go looking for something better.  Happiness never comes to those who don’t appreciate what they have.  A psychology study (Nickerson et al.) conducted in 2003 is proof of this.  The study examined the attitudes of 12,000 college freshmen when they were eighteen, and then measured their life-satisfaction at age 37.  Those who had expressed heightened materialistic aspirations as freshmen – always wanting something they didn’t have – were far less satisfied with their lives two decades later. To be happy doesn’t mean you don’t desire more, it means you are thankful for what you have now and patient for everything yet to come.  Too many people spend money they haven’t earned, to buy things they don’t want or need, to impress folks they don’t even know.  Don’t be one of them.  Sometimes it’s easy to get so caught up in trying to attain something new and big, that you fail to notice all the little things that give life its magic.  As Epicurus once said, “Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.” Not everything that’s faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it’s faced.  Many people never achieve what they want in life because when opportunity knocks, they’re still sleeping and dreaming and waiting for a miracle.  Remember, problems are not stop signs, they’re guidelines.  Losing is a learning experience.  Strength does not come from winning at everything.  Your greatest struggles develop your greatest strengths. In the end, you are not what you have done, but what you have overcome.  All the hardships.  All the mistakes.  All the rejections.  All the pain.  All the times you questioned why.  All of these things have given birth to the wisdom and strength that will help you shine your light on the world, even in the darkest of hours.  (Read The Road Less Traveled.) We all have a story.  We’ve all gone through something that has changed us in a way that we could never go back to who we once were.  In life, this kind of change is inevitable.  Everything around you is impermanent – your body, your possessions, your relationships, etc.  You don’t have control over every little thing that happens to you, but you do have control over how you decide to internalize it. Pay as much attention to the changes that are working positively in your life as you do to those changes that are giving you trouble.  Appreciate how the unexpected is sometimes better than what you expected.  And above all, stop stressing over what’s behind you.  The end of something good is always the beginning of something great.  Say to yourself: “Dear Past, thank you for all the life lessons you have taught me.  Dear Present, I am ready now!”  Because a priceless new beginning always occurs at the point you thought would be the end of everything. Bottom line:  Don’t sweat the small stuff.  Live simply.  Love generously.  Speak truthfully.  Work diligently.  Then let go and let what’s meant to be, be. Oliver Wendell Holmes once said, “Too many people die with their music still in them.”  I believe this is due in part to our tolerance of the wrong things – needless sources of stress that can be ignored.  So what do you think?  What would you add to this list?  What sources of stress do you need to ignore more often?  Please leave us a comment below and share your thoughts.

Surviving the ups, downs, and lightning storms of other people’s moodiness can be quite a challenge.  It’s important, though, to remember that some moody, negative people may be going through a difficult stage in their lives.  They may be ill, chronically worried, or lacking what they need in terms of love and emotional support.  Such people need to be listened to, supported, and cared for (although whatever the cause of their moodiness and negativity, you may still need to protect yourself from their behavior at times). But there’s another type of moody, negative behavior: that of the toxic bully, who will use his or her mood swings to intimidate and manipulate.  It’s this aspect of moodiness that inflicts enduring abuse and misery.  If you observe these people closely, you will notice that their attitude is overly self-referential.  Their relationships are prioritized according to how each one can be used to meet their selfish needs.  This is the kind of toxic behavior I want to look at in this post. I’m a firm believer that toxic mood swings (like chain letter emails) should not be inflicted on one person by another, under any circumstances.  So how can you best manage the fallout from other people’s relentless toxicity? If you know someone who insists on destructively dictating the emotional atmosphere, then be clear: they are toxic.  If you are suffering because of their attitude, and your compassion, patience, advice, and general attentiveness doesn’t seem to help them, and they don’t seem to care one bit, then ask yourself, “Do I need this person in my life?” When you delete toxic people from your environment it becomes a lot easier to breathe.  If the circumstances warrant it, leave these people behind and move on when you must.  Seriously, be strong and know when enough is enough!  Letting go of toxic people doesn’t mean you hate them, or that you wish them harm; it simply means you care about your own well-being. A healthy relationship is reciprocal; it should be give and take, but not in the sense that you’re always giving and they’re always taking.  If you must keep a truly toxic person in your life for whatever reason, then consider the remaining points… If you’re not careful, toxic people can use their moody behavior to get preferential treatment, because… well… it just seems easier to quiet them down than to listen to their grouchy rhetoric.  Don’t be fooled.  Short-term ease equals long-term pain for you in a situation like this.  Toxic people don’t change if they are being rewarded for not changing.  Decide this minute not to be influenced by their behavior.  Stop tiptoeing around them or making special pardons for their continued belligerence. Constant drama and negativity is never worth putting up with.  If someone over the age 21 can’t be a reasonable, reliable adult on a regular basis, it’s time to… Stand up for yourself.  Some people will do anything for their own personal gain at the expense of others – cut in line, take money and property, bully and belittle, pass guilt, etc.  Do not accept this behavior.  Most of these people know they’re doing the wrong thing and will back down surprisingly quickly when confronted.  In most social settings people tend to keep quiet until one person speaks up, so SPEAK UP. Some toxic people may use anger as a way of influencing you, or they may not respond to you when you’re trying to communicate, or interrupt you and suddenly start speaking negatively about something dear to you.  If ever you dare to speak up and respond adversely to their moody behavior, they may be surprised, or even outraged, that you’ve trespassed onto their behavioral territory.  But you must speak up anyway. Not mentioning someone’s toxic behavior can become the principal reason for being sucked into their mind games.  Challenging this kind of behavior upfront, on the other hand, will sometimes get them to realize the negative impact of their behavior.  For instance, you might say: Direct statements like these can be disarming if someone truly does use their moody attitude as a means of social manipulation, and these statements can also open a door of opportunity for you to try to help them if they are genuinely facing a serious problem. Even if they say: “What do you mean?” and deny it, at least you’ve made them aware that their attitude has become a known issue to someone else, rather than just a personal tool they can use to manipulate others whenever they want.  (Read Toxic People.) And if they persist in denial, it might be time to… Your dignity may be attacked, ravaged and disgracefully mocked, but it can never be taken away unless you willingly surrender it.  It’s all about finding the strength to defend your boundaries. Demonstrate that you won’t be insulted or belittled.  To be honest, I’ve never had much luck trying to call truly toxic people (the worst of the worst) out when they’ve continuously insulted me.  The best response I’ve received is a snarky, “I’m sorry you took what I said so personally.”  Much more effective has been ending conversations with sickening sweetness or just plain abruptness.  The message is clear:  There is no reward for subtle digs and no games will be played at your end. Truly toxic people will pollute everyone around them, including you if you allow them.  If you’ve tried reasoning with them and they aren’t budging, don’t hesitate to vacate their space and ignore them until they do. It’s them, not you.  KNOW this. Toxic people will likely try to imply that somehow you’ve done something wrong.  And because the “feeling guilty” button is quite large on many of us, even the implication that we might have done something wrong can hurt our confidence and unsettle our resolve.  Don’t let this happen to you. Remember, there is a huge amount of freedom that comes to you when you take nothing personally.  Most toxic people behave negatively not just to you, but to everyone they interact with.  Even when the situation seems personal – even if you feel directly insulted – it usually has nothing to do with you.  What they say and do, and the opinions they have, are based entirely on their own self-reflection.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Sometimes it makes sense to be sympathetic with toxic people whom you know are going through a difficult time, or those who are suffering from an illness.  There’s no question about it, some toxic people are genuinely distressed, depressed, or even mentally and physically ill, but you still need to separate their legitimate issues from how they behave toward you.  If you let people get away with anything because they are distressed, facing a medical condition, or depressed, even, then you are making it too tempting for them to start unconsciously using their unfortunate circumstance as a means to an end. Several years ago, I volunteered at a psychiatric hospital for children.  I mentored a boy there named Dennis, a diagnosed Bipolar disorder patient.  Dennis was a handful sometimes, and would often shout obscenities at others when he experienced one of his episodes.  But no one ever challenged his outbursts, and neither had I up to this point.  After all, he’s clinically “crazy” and can’t help it, right? One day I took Dennis to a local park to play catch.  An hour into our little field trip, Dennis entered one of his episodes and began calling me profane names.  But instead of ignoring his remarks, I said, “Stop bullying me and calling me names.  I know you’re a nice person, and much better than that.”  His jaw literally dropped.  Dennis looked stunned, and then, in a matter of seconds, he collected himself and replied, “I’m sorry I was mean Mr. Marc.” The lesson here is that you can’t “help” someone by making unwarranted pardons for everything they do simply because they have problems.  There are plenty of people who are going through extreme hardships who are not toxic to everyone around them.  We can only act with genuine compassion when we set boundaries.  Making too many pardons and allowances is not healthy or practical for anyone in the long-term.  (Read Who’s Pulling Your Strings?) If you are forced to live or work with a toxic person, then make sure you get enough alone time to relax, rest, and recuperate.  Having to play the role of a “focused, rational adult” in the face of toxic moodiness can be exhausting, and if you’re not careful, the toxicity can infect you.  Again, understand that even people with legitimate problems and clinical illnesses can still comprehend that you have needs as well, which means you can politely excuse yourself when you need to. You deserve this time away.  You deserve to think peacefully, free from external pressure and toxic behavior.  No problems to solve, boundaries to uphold, or personalities to please.  Sometimes you need to make time for yourself, away from the busy world you live in that doesn’t make time for you. What are your experiences with toxic people?  What have you done to cope with their behavior?  Please share your thoughts by leaving a comment below. Photo by: Monkeyc 9 Fears You Will Regret Never Facing|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/9-fears-facing.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| “Do one thing every day that scares you.”?Eleanor Roosevelt Today, I volunteered at a blood drive downtown.  One of the women who came in to donate blood was literally crying in fear as I called her into the donor’s room.  When I realized just how terrified she was, I told her, “It’s OK, calm down.  You don’t have to give blood if you don’t want to.”  She looked up at me from the donor chair, cracked a half smile through her tears and said, “I know, but I want to.  Fear shouldn’t stop me from doing what’s right.” Wow!  Talk about a wake-up call.  Her words immediately forced me to think about all the little fears that have been holding me back.  I’m sure you can relate.  So lets take a look at nine fears we can start facing today to avoid regret and heartache down the road. Our greatest fear is not that we are not special enough; our greatest fear is that we are too special.  It is our brilliance, not our deficiencies that often frighten us most.  Sometimes you likely catch yourself asking, “Who am I to think I can do this?”  When in fact you should be saying, “Who am I to think I can’t?”  Ignore your doubts.  Forget about fitting in.  Stand out! Don’t sell yourself short.  Don’t save face and then lose your soul in the process.  Doing so does not serve the world.  There is nothing helpful about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you.  You are meant to shine in a way only YOU can.  You were born to manifest all the unique brilliance inside you.  And as you let your light shine bright, you subconsciously give others permission to do the same.  As you are liberated from your own fear of standing out, your presence automatically liberates those around you too. There will NEVER be a perfect time to pursue your dreams and goals.  You will never feel 100% ready, because you will never be 100% complete.  You’re growing every day.  You just have to find faith in yourself right now.  Faith means living with uncertainty, feeling your way through life, letting your intuition guide you like a flashlight in the dark. What if, for today, you choose to believe that you have enough, you are enough, and that you’ve come far enough to be worthy?  What if, for today, you choose to believe that you are strong enough, wise enough, kind enough, and loved enough to move forward?  What if, as the sun sets on today, you choose to believe that you did a pretty good job?  And what if tomorrow morning, you choose to believe it all over again?  (Angel and I cover this in more detail in the “Self-Love” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Sometimes life sucks.  Sometimes life gets so hard that you don’t want to get out of bed in the morning.  Sometimes life is so stressful that all you want to do is curl up and cry.  But sometimes life is beautiful.  Sometimes life is so amazing that all you want to do is smile.  Sometimes you just have to stay positive, and push through the hard times.  Why?  Because life is worth it.  The good times are worth it.  YOU are worth it. Realize that fear is the worst of it; fear is your real enemy.  So get up, get out in the stormy weather of the real world, and kick fear as hard as you can right in the teeth.  Do so by staring at it dead in the eyes and then walking right through it into the storm.  Let the rain kiss your skin.  That’s the first step.  Because once you’re wet, you won’t fear the rain anymore. Life’s toughest struggles are intended to make you better, not bitter.  Your struggles with “losing” develop your greatest strengths.  Many of the most vital lessons you learn in life you don’t necessarily seek on purpose.  Sometimes the wrong choices bring you to the right places.  In fact, every time you screw up, you’re one step closer to your goal.  The only mistake that can truly hurt you is choosing to do nothing simply because you’re too scared to make a mistake. Failure is not falling down; failure is staying down when you have the choice to get back up.  Ultimately, what you need to remember is that you are in competition with one person and one person only – yourself.  Your toughest competitor is simply the voices in your head.  You can’t fail; you can only learn what you need to know to get up and take the next step. I hate to break it to you, but you can’t control everything in your life no matter how many safeguards you put into place.  Life is about finding a balance between what we can and cannot control.  You must learn to live comfortably between effort and surrender.  Life does not owe you anything; it has already given you everything you need.  Freedom is not overcoming what you think stands in your way; it is understanding that what is in your way is part of the way. Quite simply, the reason you are sometimes miserable and stressed is because of an unhealthy attachment to certain things you have no control over.  So let go; release the tension and stress.  Realize you haven’t lost anything; you were never in control to begin with.  See what happens when you loosen your grip, throw your hands into the air, and allow life to just happen and flow as it does, without constant worry and micromanagement.  (Read The Power of Now.) Some people spend their entire lives living in another time and place.  They lament about what has been, what they could have done, or what might become.  Don’t be one of them.  If you live your life with the regrets of yesterday and the worries of tomorrow, you’ll have no “today” to be thankful for.  Let go and live!  Don’t let the past and future steal your present. You act like it’s you against the world, but it’s really just you against yourself.  You become a prisoner in your own mind when you cling to the pains of another time and place.  Instead, be free and cling no more.  If you’re brave enough to say “goodbye,” life will always reward you with a new “hello.”  So keep your faith and focus on the present as you put one foot in front of the other.  Doing so won’t make all your dreams and goals easier, but it will make them possible. As you grow older, what you look like on the outside becomes less and less of an issue, and who you are on the inside becomes the focal point of interest.  You eventually realize that beauty has almost nothing to do with looks; it’s who you are as a person, how you make others feel about themselves, and most importantly, how you feel about yourself. So no matter how plain and undesirable you may feel right now, if your truth is written across your face, you are beautiful.  What you do, and the way you think, makes you beautiful.  Don’t try to be someone you’re not.  You may look into a mirror and see flaws, but someone else looks at you and sees a person they love.  This is not because they’re blind to your shortcomings but because they so clearly see your soul.  Your shortcomings then dim by comparison.  The people who care about you see the beauty of your imperfections, sometimes even before you do. Nothing in life is to be feared, everything is only to be understood.  Now is the time to understand more, so you may fear less.  Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery from fear of what you don’t understand. Those of us who can’t handle the tension of not understanding often judge and lash out at others.  We defend our circumstances by condemning people in different circumstances.  That’s how it works – you either learn to let your uncertainty come and go, or you don’t, and instead dump it on others.  So much depends on simply learning that feeling uncertain is not a sign that anything’s wrong with you or anyone else – it’s just a sign that we’re all human.  Nobody has it all figured out.  NOBODY!  We’ve all got confusion and joy and pride and exhaustion circling in our minds.  Beautiful things are hard to understand at first – they’re designed that way so we must study them carefully, which ends up bringing us together instead of pushing us apart.  (Read The Four Agreements.) Change is often resisted when it’s needed the most.  Yet, if nothing ever changed there would be no sunrise the next morning.  Most of us are comfortable where we are even though the whole universe is constantly changing around us.  Learning to accept this is vital to our happiness and general success in life.  Because only when we change, do we grow, and begin to see a world we never knew was possible. Ultimately, you can choose to let your past define you and confine you, or you can choose to learn, grow, and leave it behind you.  Just like the seasons, you have the ability to change.  In many ways, you already have. And don’t forget, however good or bad a situation is now, it will change.  That’s the one thing you can count on.  So embrace it, and realize that change happens for a reason.  It won’t always be easy or obvious at first, but in the end it will be worth it.

Photo by: Nicolo Paternoster 12 Lies People Love to Tell You|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/12-lies-people-tell.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| “Lies run sprints, but the truth runs marathons.”?Michael Jackson Over the years you’ve developed a set of beliefs based on what others have told you.  The problem is, many of these people weren’t telling the truth.  They were merely repeating the little, seemingly innocent lies someone else once told them.  Now, the false beliefs they’ve ingrained in your mind are impeding your potential and holding you back from the life you’re capable of living. Here are twelve lies you’ve likely heard and the truth that will set you free: If you want to make an impact, big or small, get comfortable with being uncomfortable.  All growth begins at the end of your comfort zone.  Maybe the thing you’re scared of is exactly what you should do.  Sometimes life is about risking it all for a dream no one can see but you. In the end, you will not regret the things you have done nearly as much as the things you have left undone.  It’s always better to be left with a few “oh wells,” than a bunch of “what ifs.”  It’s better to have a lifetime full of experiences and mistakes you learned from, rather than a heart full of regrets and empty dreams.  Someday you will want to look back at your life and say, “I can’t believe I did that!” instead of, “Gosh, I wish I would have…”  (Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Goals and Success” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) When a dream matters enough to a person, that person will find a way to achieve what at first seemed impossible.  Let that person be YOU.  It’s kind of fun to do the impossible.  Go after your dream, no matter how unattainable others tell you it is.  What’s impossible to them may not be impossible for you. You must choose yourself and live your life from beginning to end; no one else can do it for you.  Claiming full control over your health, dreams, and well-being are some of the areas in your life where you get to be a little selfish and not feel bad about it.  If you want to reach your goals, you have to be the center of this part of your journey.  You have to make it work for you and you alone.  It’s not selfishness, it’s self-care and self-improvement.  Anything less is a setup for failure. People are sometimes too quick to judge, but slow to correct themselves.  Don’t be one of them.  Focus on your own growth, goals, and self-worth.  Leave people to their opinions and judgments.  Let them respect you for who you are, and not for who they want you to be…  Or let them walk away if they choose.  Either way, they can’t harm you; it’s their understanding that is faulty, not yours. Strength doesn’t come from what you can do; it comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn’t do.  When you are at your lowest point, you are open to the greatest positive change.  Happiness is not the absence of problems, but the strength to deal with them.  The strongest people are the ones who feel pain, accept it, learn from it, and fight through it.  They turn their wounds into wisdom.  (Read The Road Less Traveled.) The Chinese symbol for the word “crisis” is written using two strokes of a pen.  One stroke stands for danger, and the other for opportunity.  In other words, in a crisis, beware of the danger, but also recognize the opportunity.  Life always balances itself out.  Everything that happens is neither positive nor negative; it just depends on your perspective. The love of your life isn’t perfect, you aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect.  But if you can make each other laugh once in awhile, cause each other to think twice about the sweetness of life, and both admit to being human and making mistakes, your relationship is something special.  No, you two may not always choose the most poetic words, and there will likely be inconsiderate slip-ups on occasion, but that’s what makes your bond real.  Smile when they make you happy, speak up when they make you mad, and miss them when they’re gone.  Love hard when there is love to be had.  Perfect love doesn’t exist, but true love does, and it’s worth the effort. Love between two people comes because both people want to share their love, not because YOU want it from the other person.  Your family, friends, co-workers, partner – they all love you because they choose to, not because you want them to.  Love is meant to be felt, enjoyed and lived, not to be forced on anyone. Kindness is not to be mistaken for weakness, nor forgiveness for acceptance.  It’s about knowing resentment is not on the path to happiness.  Having confidence and class is the ability to walk away from a bad situation with a smile on your face and forgiveness in your heart. There are two ways of being rich: One is to have all you want, the other is to be satisfied with what you have.  Accept and appreciate things now, and you’ll find more happiness in every moment you live.  Happiness comes when you stop complaining about the troubles you have and offer thanks for all the troubles you don’t have.  And remember, you have to fight through some bad days to earn the best days of your life.  (Read The How of Happiness.) Anyone can run away; it’s super easy.  Facing issues and working through them makes you strong.  Focus on your dreams, not your problems.  It’s not too late.  A hundred disappointments in the past can’t equal the power of one positive action right now.  Talk is cheap; action is priceless.  Go for it!  Give yourself another chance. What would you add to this list?  What (seemingly innocent) lies do people often tell each other?  How have these lies affected you personally?  Share your thoughts with us by leaving a comment below.

"10 Risks Happy People Take Every Day|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-dare-you-today.jpg?resize=500%2C375&ssl=1| “You cannot protect yourself from sadnesswithout protecting yourself from happiness.”— Jonathan Foer Almost two decades ago, somewhat as a joke since she tutored me throughout grade school, I asked my grandmother to sign my yearbook.  This was her closing paragraph: “The best thing you can do from this day forward is to follow your intuition.  Take risks.  Don’t just make the safe and easy choices because you’re afraid of what could happen.  If you do, very little worth remembering will ever happen.” Years later, as I grew interested in the psychology of happiness, I realized how pertinent my grandmother’s words were.  Risk is an inherent part of living a good life.  Without taking risks, you cannot truly live… you merely exist.  Which is why the happiest among us take small risks every day.  Let’s take a look at ten examples, and examine some ideas on how to implement them in your own life. As you grow up, you will learn that even the one person who wasn’t supposed to ever let you down probably will in some small way.  You will have your heart broken probably more than once.  You too will inadvertently break some hearts, so remember how it felt when yours was broken.  You’ll occasionally argue with your closest friends.  You’ll blame new loves for things an old one did.  You’ll cry because time is passing too fast, and you’ll eventually lose someone you thought you couldn’t live without.  This is what happens when you open your heart and mind to the greatest joys of life. Chuck Palahniuk once said, “The only way to find true happiness in life is to risk being completely cut open.”  Nothing could be closer to the truth.  Anybody who is capable of living and loving is bound to get hurt at some point, but that’s a risk that’s well worth the reward.  The result is a life filled with honesty and love. So take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like you’ve never been hurt.  Don’t be afraid that your days will end in pain, be afraid they will never begin with honesty and love.  Life is too short to let it pass by.  Open your heart and mind and live it to the fullest! You don’t need everyone to like you.  You are a piece of art.  Not everyone is going to see your beauty.  Ultimately, it’s YOUR opinion of yourself that matters, and if someone doesn’t like it, forget about them.  Stop being a people-pleaser all the time, because when you go around pleasing everyone but yourself, you are the one that gets hurt. Your value doesn’t decrease based on someone’s inability to see your worth.  It’s their loss, not yours.  So be careful not to give so much of yourself to others that you end up completely losing yourself.  In the end you will know who truly loves you; they’re the ones who respect you for who you are, and no matter what, they stand by your side.  Surround yourself with these people.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) You will always be missing out on something.  You simply can’t have it all.  Thus it will always seem like something wonderful might be happening elsewhere.  And that’s OK.  Let it go, and realize you have everything right now.  The best in life isn’t somewhere else; it’s right where you are at this moment.  You have to accept that some things will never be yours, and learn to value the things that are only yours. What you take for granted, someone else is praying for.  Happiness never comes to those who don’t appreciate what they already have.  Don’t wait until what you HAVE becomes what you HAD.  Pause and appreciate all the good things you have in your life right now, as they are happening. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “The purpose of life is not to simply be happy.  It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.” Happiness doesn’t come through selfishness, but through selflessness.  Everything you do comes back around.  Greet people with a smile.  Encourage them.  Compliment them.  Notice their progress, cheer them on, and help them smile.  Smiles are contagious.  The more happiness you help others find in life, the more happiness you will find. Remember, happiness comes from your own choices and actions.  Waiting for someone else to make you happy is the best way to be sad.  The more you take responsibility for your past and present, the more you are able to create the future you seek. So stop blaming others for what you have or don’t have, or for what you feel or don’t feel.  When you blame others for what you’re going through, you deny responsibility and perpetuate the problem.  Stop giving your power away and start taking responsibility for your life.  Blaming is just another sorry excuse, and making excuses is the first step towards both misery and failure.  YOU, and only you, are responsible for your decisions; make a good one right now that your future self will thank you for.  (Read Buddha’s Brain.) Today is a new day – a new beginning.  You have been given this day to use as you please.  You can waste it or you can use it for something worthwhile.  Either way, what you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it.  You can’t always wait for the perfect time, because there may be no such thing.  Sometimes you must dare to jump. It is only possible to live happily ever after on a daily basis.  Laziness and procrastination may appear attractive, but action leads to happiness.  Great challenges make life interesting; overcoming them makes life meaningful.  When tomorrow comes, today will be gone forever.  In its place will be something that you have left behind.  Let it be something worthwhile – something you are thankful for. Needless worry gives small things a big shadow.  In the end, you can either focus on what’s tearing you apart, or what’s holding you together.  You have to roll with life instead of against it.  And sorry for spoiling the ending for you… but everything is going to be OK – you just need to learn a lesson or two first. Don’t run from the realities of your present struggles.  The pain and defeat contained within them are necessary to your long-term growth.  Remember, there is a difference between encountering defeats and being defeated.  Nothing ever goes away until it teaches you what you need to know to grow. If you are too afraid of failure, you can’t possibly do what needs to be done to succeed in living a fulfilling life.  The key is to get comfortable with being uncomfortable.  Comfort is state of being in which to find rest and renewal for a short time; it is a dreary and dismal place to remain permanently.  If you don’t challenge yourself on a regular basis, by taking small steps into unfamiliar territory, your abilities and effectiveness will become stale and weak.  The reason life can be so rewarding is precisely because nothing is guaranteed. Some of your best life experiences and opportunities will come to you only after you dare to lose.  When your efforts are met with failure, you know you are on to something; because on the flip-side of that failure is a real, substantial accomplishment that doesn’t come easy.  Your failed attempt is simply evidence that you are reaching higher.  And “higher” is always the best direction to travel in.  (Read The Road Less Traveled.) Down days and disappointments are completely normal, and not something you should feel guilty about having.  Happiness is never constant.  Surrendering to your sadness, or whatever negative emotion is trying to come to the surface, does not make you a bad person.  But remember, if you aren’t sincerely thankful for every smile, don’t be totally shocked by every tear.  Keep things in perspective. Once you embrace unpleasant news, not as a negative but as evidence of a need for positive change, you’re learning from it and growing.  Whatever life throws at you, even if it hurts, be strong and fight through it.  Remember, strong walls shake but never collapse.  Life always offers you another chance… it’s called tomorrow. Holding on to what’s no longer there holds too many of us back.  Some of us spend the majority of our lives recounting the past and letting it steer the course of the present.  Don’t waste your time trying to live in another time and place.  Let the past GO!  You must accept the end of something in order to begin to build something new.  So close some old doors today.  Not because of pride, inability or egotism, but simply because you’ve entered each one of them in the past and realize that they lead to nowhere. When we continue to repeat a story in our head, as all of us do, we eventually believe that story and embrace it – whether it empowers us or not.  So the question is:  Does your story empower you?  Don’t place your past mishaps on your mind, their weight may crush your current potential.  Instead, place them under your feet and use them as a platform to view the horizon.  Remember, all things are difficult before they are easy.  What matters the most is what you start doing now. Remember, what counts the most is not what you learned by reading this article, but how you apply the knowledge.  You must take action.  So start small, but start now. Choose one of the ten points above that speaks to you and practice working on it today, tomorrow and every day for the next few months.  Eventually, one day, without even thinking about it you’ll start doing it automatically.  And you’ll suddenly realize that your diligent practice has evolved into a permanent, internalized habit of happiness.

We suddenly realized how the fragility of life makes every moment so meaningful, and that most of us waste far too many moments immersing ourselves in needless distractions that steal our attention away from the things that actually matter. If you feel like you’re on the wrong track with what matters most to you, here are nine warning signs to look for, and tips to get you back on track: There are people who live their entire lives on the default settings, never realizing they can customize everything.  Don’t be one of them. You have to live your own life your own way.  That’s all there is to it.  Each of us has a unique fire in our heart for something that makes us feel alive.  It’s your duty to find it and keep it lit.  You’ve got to stop caring so much about what everyone else wants for you, and start actually living for yourself. Find your love, your talents, your passions and embrace them.  Don’t hide behind other people’s decisions.  Don’t let others tell you what you want.  Design and experience YOUR life!  The life you create from doing something that moves you is far better than the life you get from sitting around wishing you were doing it.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Passion and Growth” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Never let your fear decide your future.  To play it too safe is one of the riskiest choices you can make.  You cannot grow unless you are willing to change and adapt.  You will never improve yourself if you cling to what used to be simply because it’s familiar and comfortable. Accept what is, let go of what was and have faith in what could be.  The bold steps you take into the unknown won’t be easy, but every step is worth it.  There’s no telling how many miles you will have to run while chasing a dream, but this chase is what gives meaning to life.  And even if you have to fail several times before you succeed, your worst attempt will always be 100% better than the person who settles and never tries at all. Nothing in life is easy. Don’t expect things to be given to you.  Go out and achieve them.  Good things come to those who work for them.  Some have natural talent, while others make up for it with tremendous heart and determination, and it’s almost always the latter group that succeeds in the long run. There is too much emphasis on finding a ‘quick fix’ in today’s society.  For example taking diet pills to lose weight instead of exercising and eating well.  No amount of magic fairy dust replaces diligent, focused, hard work. Working and training for something is the opposite of hoping for it.  If you believe in it with all your heart, then work for it with all your might.  Great achievements must be earned.  There is no elevator to success; you must take the stairs.  So forget how you feel and remember what you deserve.  NOW is always the best time to break out of your shell and show the world who you really are and what you’re really made of.  Start right where you are, use what you have, do what you can, and give it your best shot. The big difference between an obstacle and an opportunity is how you look at it.  Look at the positives and don’t dwell on the negatives.  If you keep your head down, you’ll miss life’s goodness. There’s no shortage of problems waiting to be addressed.  When you see problems piled on top of problems, and when there seems to be no end to the work that must be done in order to resolve them, what are you really seeing?  You’re looking at a mountain of opportunity.  You’re looking at a situation in which you can truly make a difference.  You’re looking at an environment where you can reach great heights by raising the stakes and pulling the reality of what’s possible along with you. When you look at an obstacle, but see opportunity instead, you become a powerful source that transforms grief into greatness.  (Read Flourish.) To achieve success and sustain happiness in life, you must focus your attention on the right things, in the right ways.  Every growing human being (that means all of us) has resource constraints: limited time and energy.  It is critical that you spend your resources effectively.  You have to stay laser-focused on doing the RIGHT work, instead of doing a bunch of inconsequential work, right. Not all work is created equal.  Don’t get caught up in odd jobs, even those that seem urgent, unless they are also important.  Don’t confuse being busy with being productive. We are judged by what we finish, not what we start.  Period. Think about it, you rarely fail for the things you do.  You fail for the things you don’t do, the business you leave unfinished, and the things you make excuses about for the rest of your life. In all walks of life, passion is what starts it and dedication is what finishes it. Never get so busy making a living that you forget to make a life for yourself.  Never get so busy that you don’t have time to be kind and connect with others.  The happiest lives are connected to quality relationships.  If you are too busy to share an occasional laugh with someone, you are too busy. Truth be told, sometimes we’re so busy watching out for what’s just ahead of us that we don’t take time to enjoy where we are and who we’re with.  So lift your head up today and appreciate those standing beside you.  The people you take for granted today may turn out to be the only ones you need tomorrow. Oh, and if you’re currently on the fast track to success, be sure to be nice to people on your way up, because you might meet them again on your way back down.  Remember life is a circle.  Everything comes back around. Wrong things happen when you trust and worry about the wrong people.  Don’t make too much time for people who rarely make time for you, or who only make time for you when it’s convenient for them.  Know your worth.  Know the difference between what you’re getting from people and what you deserve. Surround yourself with those who will support you when it rains, not just when it shines.  And above all, remember that people come and people go.  That’s life.  You have to stop holding on to those who have let go of you long ago.  (Read Emotional Blackmail.) Needless drama doesn’t just walk into your life out of nowhere; you either create it, invite it or associate with those who bring it.  Do not let anyone’s ignorance, hate, drama or negativity stop you from being the best person you can be. Be an example of a pure existence.  Don’t spew hostile words at someone who spews them at you.  Ignore their foolish antics and focus on kindness.  Communicate and express yourself from a place of peace, from a place of love, with the best intentions.  Use your voice for good – to inspire, to encourage, to educate, and to spread the notions of compassion and understanding. If someone insists on foisting their hostility and drama on you, simply ignore them and walk away.  Sometimes people will talk about you when they envy the life you lead.  Let them be.  You affected their life; don’t let them affect yours.  Those who create their own drama deserve their own karma.  Don’t get sidetracked by people who are not on track. If you are reading this, smile.  Although nothing in life is ever guaranteed, you can always choose to make the present a positive, productive experience. What you do with this moment is what’s most important, because the present is the steering wheel of your life.  The only difference between where you are and where you want to be, at any point in time, is what you are presently doing.  Your present actions can instantly steer you onto the right track.  From this moment forward everything changes if you want it to.  You simply have to decide what to do right now. In what way have you traveled down the wrong track in life?  What have you learned and what changes have you made?  Leave us a comment below and share your thoughts. Photo by: Dustin McClure 10 Truths You Will Learn Before You Find Happiness|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-truths-before-happiness.jpg?resize=500%2C339&ssl=1| “Happiness is when what you think, what you say,and what you do are in harmony.”— Mahatma Gandhi We are all beautiful human beings here in this world trying to find our way.  Every day we seek to better understand the meaning of our lives.  We long to discover our gifts and release them fully into the world, and we hope to find happiness and peace along the way.  For some of us the key to these desires rings loud and clear, driving what we do and how we do it.  For others, these deep seeded needs are buried below the noise of daily life, below ego, below fear, below the pressures and norms that we face in society… and thus, they are rarely addressed. Along my own journey of self-actualization, I’ve witnessed dozens of great people discover their own paths to happiness and self-fulfillment, and I’ve noticed many common themes emerge.  In all cases, the happiness they discover and gradually develop internally is seeded by the realization of certain fundamental truths. It seems we are all here to realize these truths, in our own way, in our own time.  And once they resonate fully, not just intellectually, but emotionally and spiritually, we are then able to find the happiness and peace we seek… You are indefinable.  You are the only one in this world who gets to say who you are.  Circumstances and the opinions of others can only define you if you allow them to.  Do not give away your power and the magic of your essence by putting weight on negative situations in your life or the negative words of other people. There is nothing you are missing.  There is no need to frantically become more, be more, do more, or get more.  You are whole and complete, and were gifted every talent and insight you needed to thrive in this world in the moment you were born.  Your only job is to accept this truth and then allow it to unfold.  Some gifts don’t become apparent until later in life.  Some insights only become clear to you once you have life experiences that unlock such wisdom from within you.  Trust in this and relax. We are beautifully imperfect beings, operating in a very imperfect world, and that is just the way it is meant to be.  Striving for perfection is a hollow goal, one that can never be achieved.  Society shows us doctored images of perfection constantly in marketing, media, opinions and expectations.  Do not buy into this illusion; it will only lead you into darkness.  Embrace your quirks, your flaws and the fact that life is a roller coaster at times.  Strive for excellence, have high standards… but never confuse that with the crippling behavior of perfectionism. You are the witnessing essence and consciousness behind the noise in your mind.  Your mind doesn’t define you, nor does it control you.  It is not who you are.  As soon as you recognize this, by watching your thoughts like an intrigued third-party observer, you will create instant distance from those thoughts and therefore no longer be identified with or enslaved by them.  (Read The Power of Now.) Whatever you believe to be true about yourself and life in the long-term becomes your reality.  Your beliefs are ingrained patterns of thinking that you build up over a lifetime.  They are habitual ways of processing the world around you.  If those beliefs don’t work in your favor, you can change them.  How?  In the very same way the negative beliefs formed in the first place – via repetitive thoughts that you accepted to be the truth.  Ingrain new beliefs by consciously choosing and repeating messages that lift you up. Now is the moment.  The past is just a memory.  The future is a mental projection.  You can choose to dwell back in the past for learning and joyous reflection.  You can choose to dwell in the future for visualization and practical planning.  However, any time your awareness floats away to the past or future frequently for negative purposes, you are suffocating your ability to thrive in the only moment you ever have… the now.  Past and future literally do not exist right now – feel the freedom in this truth.  (Read The Untethered Soul.) The world will never see another human being like you.  There is no one on the face of the planet that has what you have.  Your uniqueness, in every respect, is your gift.  Life asks one thing of you… to be the full expression of yourself so that you can leave your unique imprint on all those you encounter and upon the world.  Never underestimate the power of your energy and how it ripples outwards to affect everything and everyone around you – IF you are being your full, authentic self.  Honor your intuition and act upon all your inspirations. Without challenges you cannot unlock your full potential.  Obstacles are opportunities for growth.  The world needs the fullness of who you are, and it is through your experiences in life that you unfold into that fullness.  How can you demonstrate willpower and strength if your resolve has never been tested?  How can you role model love and compassion if you have never faced the opposite?  Knowing there is a higher purpose within dark times, is what leads you to be at peace in the midst of those storms, knowing that you are a diamond being forged under pressure. We do not forgive others in order to free them of the situation, burden, guilt or regret.  We forgive others to free ourselves and walk into compassion and love by doing so.  It is in freeing ourselves that our energy level rises, our consciousness rises, and in doing so those around us benefit too.  The words of forgiveness have a positive impact on those we forgive, but ultimately forgiveness is a choice that allows us to be happy again.  This goes for both forgiveness of others and forgiveness of self. Letting go is not giving up.  Letting go is surrendering any obsessive attachment to particular people, outcomes and situations.  Surrender means showing up every day in your life with the intention to be your best self, and to do the best you know how, without expecting life to go a certain way.  Have goals, have dreams, aspire and take purposeful action, but detach from what life must look like. The energy of someone aspiring to create their dreams, teamed with surrender, is far more powerful and creative than someone determined to create outcomes with a desperate ‘must have’ mentality.  Surrender brings inner peace and joy, and lest we forget that our outer lives are a reflection of our inner state of being.  (Read 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.)

By all means, find ways to be more efficient.  But make no mistake that it takes diligent effort to build something worthwhile.  There are certainly some success stories out there about people who excelled rather quickly, but you will usually find they had put in years of related work long before anyone was paying attention to their seemingly rapid success.  In other words, their current state of achievement is simply all those years of work coming together flawlessly in the present. The most effective way to handle what must be done is to do it.  Put in the required labor.  Don’t sell yourself short by taking shortcuts like these: Someday you will look back on your life and realize that everything worthwhile you’ve ever accomplished initially challenged you.  And that is as it should be, because big challenges often prepare ordinary people for extraordinary success. Every struggle arises for a reason – for experience or a lesson.  A great journey is never easy, and no dose of adversity along the way is ever a waste of time if you learn and grow from it. Remember, an arrow can only be shot by pulling it backwards, and such is life.  When life is pulling you back with difficulties, it means it’s going to eventually launch you forward in a positive direction.  So keep focusing, and keep aiming! The decision to settle for mediocrity is a real killer.  If you settle for just anything, you’ll never know what you’re truly worthy of.  There is ample time for you to be who you want to be.  Despite the struggles that you might be facing, never give up on yourself.  Don’t just take the easy way out and settle for less than what you know you are capable of. Realize that it’s not always about trying to fix something that’s broken either.  Sometimes it’s about starting over and creating something new.  Sometimes you need to distance yourself to see things clearly.  Sometimes growing stronger means growing apart from old habits, relationships, and situations, and finding something different that truly moves you – something that gets you so excited you can’t wait to get out of bed in the morning.  That’s what LIVING is all about.  Don’t settle.  (Angel and I cover this in more detail in the “Self-Love” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) It’s not what you do every once in a while, but what you dedicate yourself to on a daily basis that makes a difference in the end.  Having a plan, even a flawed one at first, is better than no plan at all. Don’t trap yourself, endlessly, in a state where you are unable to ask for directions, even though you’re terribly lost, simply because you don’t know your destination.  Figure out what you want.  When you get real about the true feelings you crave, you end up surprising yourself with an abundance of new opportunities and possibilities. Bottom line:  One day your life will flash before your eyes.  Do your best every day to make sure it’s worth watching.  Work towards something that brings meaning to your moments. Allen Ginsberg once said, “Follow your inner moonlight; don’t hide the madness.”  In other words, in this crazy world that’s trying to make you like everyone else, find the courage to be your incredible self. Never let what other people expect from you dictate what you expect from yourself.  Clarity about your true desires is so liberating because you get to stop proving yourself to everyone, including yourself. We have all been placed on this earth to discover our own way, and we will never be happy if we live someone else’s idea of life.  So stop being ashamed of how you feel.  You have the right to feel any emotion that comes to you, and to follow a path that makes you happy.  Don’t compare yourself to others, or get discouraged by the success of others.  Follow your intuition, never give up on yourself, and stop expecting others to understand your journey, especially if they have not walked your same path.  (Read The Road Less Traveled.) Be frank with yourself.  The things you say you will deal with later rarely get done.  It’s time to get up and make an immediate difference in your life.  You know all those things you’ve been meaning to get done for the past month, year, etc.?  Pick one right now and start doing it.  Get your hands dirty, challenge your mind, and get sweaty if you have to.  Break out of your comforting lull and get involved.  If you feel crummy, it’ll make you feel better.  If you already feel good, it will make you feel great. Ultimately, you will not be judged by what you say; you will be judged by what you do.  Wake up each morning determined, so you can go to bed satisfied.  Have the courage and discipline today to do what is needed instead of simply what is convenient.  Or as Pablo Picasso once said, “Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone.” Forgetting people who hurt you is your gift to them; forgiving people who hurt you is your gift to yourself.  Always forgive others, not because they necessarily deserve forgiveness, but because you deserve peace of mind.  We are all one, so when we forgive others we forgive ourselves, which is the first step in the healing process.  Without forgiveness, the potential for true happiness in your life is limited. In addition, we often tell ourselves that we’re better off without some people in our lives, and while this can be true, you should also build forgiveness into your character.  Keep in mind that some relationships will temporarily split, only to come back together twice as strong as before.  Forgiveness alone makes this possible.  (Read The Mastery of Love.) It hurts to love someone and not be loved in return, but what hurts even more is to love someone and never find the time to let them know how you feel.  There is no greater sadness than holding on to the loving words and deeds you never delivered to those you love. The people you take for granted today may turn out to be the only ones you need tomorrow.  So make plenty of time for those who truly matter.  The best gift you can give them is the purity of your full attention.  Just be present with them and pay attention to the little things, because when you really miss someone, you miss the little things the most, like just laughing together. The journey begins when we are born.  The destination is death.  So the journey is far superior to the destination.  Don’t sell yourself short!  Make your journey worthwhile every single day, because the distance we each get to travel is a mystery. Getting where you want to go in life is not about finding a shortcut, it’s about putting in the required time and effort.  You have to set goals and fulfill your commitments, even when no one would notice but you, and know in your heart why doing so matters.

This evening when I sat down to brainstorm some ideas for a new post, Marc’s story about the other men’s complaints kept echoing through my mind.  And this got me thinking about all the failed relationships and marriages I’ve witnessed over the years, and what they had in common.  So I started jotting down notes, and before I knew it I had the perfect outline for this post – six things every couple should stop doing. If your relationship with your partner doesn’t feel as healthy and happy as it once did, there’s a good chance you both need to STOP… The best gift you can give someone you love is the purity of your full presence.  Presence is complete awareness, or paying full attention to “the now.”  If you do not find at least some amount of presence in the moments you share with your partner, it is impossible to listen, speak, compromise, or otherwise connect with them on a meaningful level. To cultivate your presence, all you need to do is sit quietly for as long as you desire and put your full attention on your breath – thinking only of what each inhale and exhale feels like.  Don’t judge or resist your inner-workings.  Simply accept and breathe.  Practice this a few times a day, and it will start to feel more natural.  This way, when you are in the thick of a deep conversation with your partner, you can access that presence and listen without judgment or impatience, speak with clarity, and learn to fully connect and compromise. Bottom line:  Be Present.  Give your partner your full attention.  Let them see their own beauty in your eyes.  Let them find their own voice through your listening ears.  Help them discover their own greatness in your presence.  (Read The Power of Now.) The secret to a healthy, lasting relationship is not about how many days, months, or years you’ve been together, it’s about how much you truly love each other every day.  You must directly express this love through your words and actions.  It seems like such a small thing, but in our busy lives we often forget that a kind word, a helping hand, or just a smile and a quick “thank you” can create a bright spot in your partner’s life. Relationships last a lifetime only when two people make a choice to keep it and work for it.  Tell your partner you love them every night, and prove it every day.  These acts of love don’t need to be extravagant; they just need to be true. Also, acknowledging and appreciating each other’s daily victories is one of the most loving things two people can do for each other.  So before going to bed every night, take a moment to openly discuss and appreciate three things you each accomplished during the day, no matter how small.  Compliment each other and celebrate together.  What we focus on expands.  What we appreciate, appreciates in value. Good relationships don’t just happen, and they aren’t built solely on a foundation of convenience.  They take time, patience, effort, and two people who want to be together and are willing to meet in the middle.  When there’s a disagreement, they work out a solution that works for both parties – a compromise, rather than a need for the other person to change or completely give in. Ultimately, love is when another person’s happiness is equally as important as your own.  It’s not only about romance, candle-lit diners and walking hand in hand; it’s about a lifetime of commitment and cooperation.  Two people don’t stay in love because they sleep in the same bed, but because they share the same foundation of honesty, trust, and respect.  (Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) When it comes to closest relationships, you don’t always have to be right, you just have to not be too worried about being wrong.  Ask yourself, “Does it really matter?”  Oftentimes it’s far better to be kind than to be right. Express your opinions freely and politely with your partner, remembering that if your purpose is to ridicule or prove them wrong, it will only bring bitterness into your relationship.  Respecting their opinion, without judging or jumping to conclusions, always carries more weight than simply being right. Bottom line:  Life is so much better when you focus on being happy together, rather than worrying about who is more right as an individual. You attract a person by the qualities you show them, you keep them around based on the qualities you truly possess.  Problems and flaws are a part of everyone’s life.  If you try to hide them, you don’t give the person who loves you a chance to truly know you and love you fully. As flawed as you might be, as out of place as you sometimes feel, and as lacking as you believe you are, you don’t have to hide the imperfect pieces of yourself from your partner.  They see your flaws as features that make you interesting, and they see your problems simply as a sign that you’re human too. By hiding things from your partner, you allow small problems to escalate and dominate both your life and your relationship.  If you make a mistake, it might be irritating, but don’t bury it inside you.  Be open about it, address it, and move on.  Our problems are really our blessings if we use them to grow stronger, both as individuals and as couples.  (Read Daring Greatly.) Getting even doesn’t help a relationship heal.  If you’re feeling pain, don’t take action that creates even more pain.  Don’t try to cover darkness with darkness.  Find the light.  Act out of love.  Do something that will enable you to move forward towards a more fulfilling reality. If your partner makes a mistake that hurts you, and you want your relationship to grow beyond it, you have to start with forgiveness.  Without it, the potential for long-term happiness in a relationship is impossible. You don’t forgive your partner because you’re weak; you forgive them because you’re strong enough to know that human beings make mistakes.  Forgiveness is giving up your craving to hurt them for hurting you.  It doesn’t mean you’re erasing the past, or forgetting what happened.  It means you’re letting go of the resentment and pain, and instead choosing to learn from the incident and move forward with your life… and hopefully move forward with your relationship too. The greatest relationships take a great deal of work.  They don’t just happen, or maintain themselves.  They thrive only when two people make an effort and take the risk of sharing what it is that’s going on in their heads and hearts. Keep in mind that every couple has ups and downs, every couple argues, and that’s the way it should be – you’re a partnership, and partnerships can’t function without regular communication and compromise.  When you don’t talk it out, there’s a lot of important stuff that ends up not getting said. And, above all, remember that it’s not all about you.  There is greatness in doing something you dislike for the sake of someone you love. What relationship mistakes would you add to this post?  What should every couple stop doing to each other?  Leave a comment below and share your thoughts with us. Photo by: Nattu "
"9 Things Happy, Successful People Choose to Ignore|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/9-choose-to-ignore.jpg?resize=500%2C409&ssl=1| “Life is to be enjoyed, not endured.”?Gordon B. Hinckley The president and co-founder of a local charity that directly cares for homeless people in our area is a 38-year-old musician and tattoo artist who’s covered from head to toe with tattoos and piercings, and has long brown dreadlocks that dangle below his waistline.  He’s been running the charity since he was 20 and has helped hundreds of people get back on their feet, including a woman I know personally who is now a successful entrepreneur. I just had a short, inspiring conversation with this unlikely hero a few minutes ago, and now I’m sitting here thinking about the dozens of happy, successful people I know like him who ignore stereotypes, negativity, and naysayers, and go against the grain to make a difference by doing things their own way… the right way. And following in their footsteps isn’t hard either; you just have to start ignoring… It’s OK to listen to others, but not at the full expense of your own intuition.  Throughout your life there will be many times when the world gets real quiet and the only thing left is the beat of your own heart.  So you’d better learn the sound of it, otherwise you’ll never understand what it’s telling you. When you spend too much time concentrating on everyone else’s perception of you, or who everyone else wants you to be, you eventually forget who you truly are.  So don’t fear the judgments of others; you know in your heart who you are and what’s true to you.  You don’t have to be someone else to impress and inspire people.  Let them be impressed and inspired by the real YOU.  Honestly, what does life matter if you lose yourself along the way?  Even your mentors should teach you HOW to think, not WHAT to think.  So if someone – anyone – is belittling your truth, it might be time to turn the other way. You can’t change what has already happened, so choose to look ahead instead of behind you.  Don’t stress.  Do your best.  Forget the rest.  Your past mistakes are meant to guide you, not define you.  Life is a beautiful circle.  You’re strong because you know your weaknesses.  You’re wise because you’ve been foolish.  You can laugh now because you’ve known sadness. It’s crazy how you always end up where you’re meant to be – how even the most tragic and stressful situations eventually teach you important lessons that you never dreamed you were going to learn.  Remember, oftentimes when things are falling apart, they are actually falling into place.  Just because you’re not where you want to be today doesn’t mean you won’t be there someday.  Everything is going to be come together – maybe not today, but eventually.  (Angel and I cover this in more detail in the “Adversity” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) A bad day is just a bad day.  It comes and it goes.  Choose not to make it anything more.  You will find that it’s necessary to let some things go simply for the reason that they’re heavy on your heart and soul.  Go ahead and let go of them.  Don’t clamp shackles to your own ankles.  It’s incredibly easy to enjoy more of your life right now, no matter what the situation.  It’s just a matter of dropping the layers of nonsense that are weighing you down. Behind every beautiful day, there has been some kind of struggle.  You fall, you rise, you make mistakes, you live, you learn.  You’re human, not perfect.  You’ve been hurt, but you’re alive.  Think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive today – to breathe, to think, to enjoy, and to chase the things you love.  Sometimes there is sadness in your journey, but there is also lots of beauty.  You must keep putting one foot in front of the other even when it hurts, for you will never know what is waiting for you just around the bend. Follow this daily to-do list and you’ll be just fine: Repeat… There are two types of pain in life: pain that hurts you, and pain that changes you.  But when you learn from it, they are one and the same.  If you want something, you must endure the pain of working for it.  It’s that simple.  If you’re not where you want to be right now, take the time to visualize yourself in the place you want to be and take the first step in that direction.  You may not be able to change your destination in a day, but you can change your direction right now. Remember, strength doesn’t come from what you can do.  It comes from overcoming the things you couldn’t.  Tough situations build strong, successful people.  No matter how much it hurts now, you have to hold your head up, grit your teeth, and keep going.  In the end, consistent action speaks for itself.  So focus diligently, work hard in silence, and let your success be your noise. In the beginning, you need to say “yes” to a lot of things to discover and establish your goals.  Later on, you need to say “no” to a lot of things and concentrate on your goals.  Stop over-committing and trying to do too much at once.  Start saying “no” more often.  If you never say “no,” you will take on too much and all you will achieve is stress and frustration. As Bruce Lee once said, “It is not a daily increase, but a daily decrease.  Hack away at the inessentials.”  Many of us spend too much time on what is urgent and not enough time on what is important.  Don’t be one of them.  It’s not what we claim are our priorities, but how we spend our time each day that reveals the truth.  Let your daily actions reflect your highest priorities.  (Read The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.) Patience is not about waiting; it’s the ability to keep a good attitude while working hard for what you believe in.  It’s the willingness to stay focused, confidently staking one small step at a time, knowing that the way you move a mountain is by moving one stone at a time.  Every stone you move, no matter how small, is progress. Whether you are working on improving your health, learning a new skill, or getting a business venture off the ground, you can’t expect instant gratification.  Instead, you must dedicate yourself to the best of your ability and understand that real change takes time.  Sometimes it may be hard to see your progress.  Sometimes it will be frustrating when the results you seek don’t appear as quickly as you had hoped.  Still, you are advancing.  Hang in there.  You may be moving things along slowly, but you are still moving a mountain. Never force anything.  Do your best, then let it be.  If it’s meant to be, it will be.  Don’t hold yourself down with things you can’t control.  Stop talking about the problem and start thinking about the solution.  Forget what could go wrong for a sec and think of what is already right. Remember, change happens for a reason.  Roll with it.  It won’t be ideal or easy at first, but it will be worth it in the end.  When times are good and everything is comfortably in order, it’s easy to become complacent and forget how skillful and resourceful you are capable of being.  Unanticipated troubles are necessary evils that push you forward, because they eventually end, but the lessons and growth you gain from them last a lifetime. Life is about overcoming fear and taking risks.  If you don’t take risks, you won’t know what you’re capable of.  If you don’t risk anything, you risk everything.  Truth be told, nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood.  Now is the time to expand your comfort zone so you can experience things and understand more… so that you may fear less in the long run. The reality, of course, is we all get afraid sometimes.  It’s not about not being afraid, but what you do when you feel that way.  When you feel doubt, or fear, or anxiety, or frustration, know that you can let it go just as surely as you can pull your hand away from a flame.  Keep your mind focused on the goodness, on the possibilities and on your most treasured goals.  What begins in your mind ends up in your life.  Think continually of the way you would like to be, let these thoughts drive your actions, and your reality will reliably catch up with your thinking.  (Read Daring Greatly.) Believe in yourself through tough times.  Believe in your capacity to succeed.  Believe that your relationships are worth the effort.  Believe that people make mistakes on their way to greatness.  Believe that people can be foolish and intelligent, selfish and generous, and stressed and happy all at once.  Believe that very few people hurt others on purpose.  Believe that there are many roads to what’s right.  Believe in your intuition, especially when you have to choose between two good paths.  Believe that the answers are out there waiting.  Believe that life will surprise you again and again.  Believe that the journey is the destination.  Believe that it’s all worth your while. Or as Roald Dahl once said, “And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places.  Those who don’t believe in magic will never find it.” Which of the points above have you struggled with?  What else do we all need to ignore more often?  Please leave a comment below and share your thoughts and insights with us.

May your life preach louder than your lips. May your success be your noise in the end. The result of enormous success is often pretty noisy — lots of people talking, writing, and sharing stories about it. The actual process of achieving enormous success, on the other hand, is far more discreet. But it’s this process that happens quietly, behind-the-scenes, that makes all the difference in the world. Marc and I are fortunate enough to know a number of enormously successful human beings. Regardless of lifestyle, industry or profession, they share many of the same quiet habits. And that’s precisely what I want to discuss with you today. Here are twelve key things the most successful people we know do quietly and diligently: [Read more…]  Let’s cut to the chase today. What you ultimately do in life comes out of who you believe you are. You have to practice believing in yourself and ignoring the naysayers. Because while you may not be able to control the impolite and unfair things some people say and do, you can press forward and decide not to be endlessly derailed by them. Of course, I know that’s all much easier said than done, but you must remind yourself that it can be done! How? Start by leveraging the right daily affirmations. After all, it’s not what others say about you, and it’s not what you broadcast to everyone else that determines the trajectory of your life. It’s what you whisper to yourself behind [Read more…]  You ultimately become what you repeatedly do. If your habits aren’t helping you, they’re hurting you. Here are some fairly common and widespread examples of the latter that will drain all your joy if you let them: Try to use frustration and inconvenience to motivate you rather than annoy you. You are in control of the way you look at life. Instead of getting angry, find the lesson. In place of envy, feel admiration. In place of worry, take action. In place of doubt, have faith. Remember that your response is always more powerful than your present circumstance. A small part of your life is decided by completely uncontrollable circumstances, while the vast majority of your life is decided by your responses. Where you ultimately end up is heavily dependent on [Read more…]  A good morning, and thus a good day, aren’t just experiences that magically happen — they are created consciously. Most of us are distracted from the get-go every morning. Trivial activities like checking social media, watching TV, and worrying about things we can’t control often set the tone of the day. And that means we waste our most well-rested time on things that don’t matter, while gradually losing touch with the significant, controllable parts of our lives that actually do matter. We simply forget that the morning hours are enormously important — they form the foundation from which the day is built. We forget that how we choose to spend these hours can be used to predict the kind of days we’re going to have, and ultimately the kind of lives we’re going to live. So if you feel like you’ve been getting a rough start lately, and stumbling through your days with diminished intention and focus, it’s time to consider [Read more…]  Perhaps it takes courage to raise children… Our youth can’t possibly know how age thinks and feels. And likewise, as we age we are often guilty of being so busy-brained that we forget what it was like to be young. Spending time with my young son helps me tap into my younger mind — he keeps me on my toes. For that I am grateful, but I still struggle as a parent. I struggle to be present. I struggle to be patient. I struggle to remember. Almost every single day. Truth be told, every parent battles with parenthood in their own way. Because parenting is not easy. What helps me is journaling about the lessons parenthood is gradually teaching me, and then referring back to what I’ve learned when I’m struggling and forgetful. Today, I want to share some quotes from my parenting journal with you. Perhaps they will assist you someday, the way they have assisted me again this morning… [Read more…] 10 Relationship Tips Everyone Forgets|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-relationship-tips-everyone.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1| “To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhow – this is a human offering that can border on miraculous.”—Elizabeth Gilbert Several years ago, on their 50th anniversary, my 87-year-old grandfather looked at my 84-year-old grandmother and said, “This right here, our relationship, this is my greatest accomplishment.” My grandfather’s words have always remained with me.  They were beautifully romantic, but more importantly, they were delightfully true.  Healthy relationships are accomplishments.  They take commitment and work, and two people who are willing to meet in the middle and put in the necessary effort. If you’re in a relationship, intimate or platonic, that could use a little help, the tips below will come in handy… Every moment of your life you are either growing or dying – and when you are physically healthy, it’s a choice, not fate.  The art of maintaining happiness in your life and relationships relies on the fine balancing act of holding on and letting go.  Yes, sometimes people you trust (including yourself) will hurt you.  Being hurt is something you can’t avoid, but being continuously miserable is always a choice.  Forgiveness is the remedy.  You have to let go of what’s behind you before you can grasp the goodness in front of you. An honest heart is the beginning of everything that is right with this world.  The most honorable people of all are not those who never make mistakes, but those who admit to them when they do, and then go on and do their best to right the wrongs they’ve made.  In the end, being honest might not always win you a lot of friends and lovers, but it will always keep the right ones in your life.  (Angel and I discuss this process in more detail in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) A good rule of thumb:  If you can’t say it to their face, you shouldn’t say it behind their back.  As Eleanor Roosevelt once said, “Great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, and small minds discuss people.”  Life is much too short to waste talking about people, gossiping, and stirring up trouble that has no substance.  If you don’t know, ask. If you don’t agree, say so.  If you don’t like it, speak up.  But never judge people behind their back. Stop judging others by your own past.  Never act, judge, or treat people like you know them better than they know themselves.  They are living a different life than you are.  What might be good for one person may not be good for another.  What might be bad for one person might change another person’s life for the better.  Allow the people in your life to make their own mistakes and their own decisions. If you want to awaken happiness in a relationship, start by living a life that makes you happy and then radiate your happiness into your relationship.  If you want to eliminate suffering in a relationship, start by eliminating the dark and negative parts of yourself, and then radiate your positivity into your relationship.  Truly, the greatest power you have in this world is the power of your own self-transformation.  All the positive change you seek in any relationship starts with the one in the mirror.  (Read The Four Agreements.) Aesop once said, “No act of kindness, however small, is ever wasted.”  Nothing could be closer to the truth.  Always be kinder than necessary.  You never know what someone is going through.  Sometimes you have to be kind to someone, not because they’re being nice, but because you are.  Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around. It takes some courage to stand up and speak; it takes even more courage to open your mind and listen.  Pay attention and be a good listener. Your ears will never get you in trouble.  The people in your life often need a listening ear more than they need a rambling voice.  And don’t listen with the intent to reply; hear what is being said with the intent to understand.  You are as beautiful as the love you give, and you are as wise as the silence you leave behind. You never lose by loving; you lose by holding back.  No relationship is impossible until you refuse to give it a chance.  Love means giving someone the chance to hurt you, but trusting them not to.  Without this trust, a relationship cannot survive.  You cannot just believe what you fear from others; you have to believe in the good faith of others.  If you are ever going to have someone trust you, you must feel that you can trust them too. Unconditional acceptance is something we want, but rarely ever give out.  Remember, people never do anything that is out of character.  They may do things that go against your expectations, but what people do reveals exactly who they are.  Never force your expectations on people, other than the expectation that they will be exactly who they are.  Who they are is not what they say or what you have come to expect, it is who they reveal themselves to be.  Either you accept them as they are, or you move on without them.  (Read Getting the Love You Want.) Know your worth!  When you give your time to someone who doesn’t respect you, you surrender pieces of your heart you will never get back.  All failed relationships hurt, but losing someone who doesn’t appreciate and respect you is actually a gain, not a loss.  Some people come into your life temporarily simply to teach you something.  They come and they go and they make a difference.  It’s perfectly okay that they’re not in your life anymore.  You now have more time to focus on the relationships that truly matter. Remember, even the healthiest relationships have small flaws.  Being too black and white about the quality and health of a relationship spells trouble.  Accept the fact that there will always be difficulties present, but you can still focus on the good.  Instead of constantly looking for signs of what’s not working in your relationship, what you need to do is look for signs of what is, and then use this as a solid foundation to build upon. Which of these relationship tips do you sometimes struggle with?  What else would you add to the list?  Please leave us a comment below and share your thoughts.

The road of life is rarely smooth.  It’s easy to stumble and fall and hurt yourself.  But these bumps and bruises are a necessary part of your growth – you fall down, you learn something, and then you brush yourself off and move forward. Today, let’s take a step forward.  Your bad habits – the ones that hurt your health and happiness – are 100% dependent on YOU for their survival.  Stop allowing these habits to control, limit, stifle, and discourage you from being your best self.  Today is YOURS to shape; own it!  Break free from the bad habits that are poisoning and diluting your potential. Life is a series of continuous natural events and changes.  Don’t resist them; doing so only creates unnecessary stress.  Let the reality of these events and changes take place.  Let them flow.  Or as Henry Wadsworth once said, “For after all, the best thing one can do when it is raining is let it rain.” To move forward in life you must first accept the reality of what it is.  This acceptance provides you with an important starting point from which you can move in any direction you choose.  To deny this reality or to fight against the past will merely waste your time and energy.  To wish that things were different, or to pretend that they are, gets you nowhere. Acceptance is letting go and allowing things to be the way they truly are.  It doesn’t mean you don’t care about improving the realities of life; it’s just realizing that the only thing you really have control over is yourself in the present moment.  This simple understanding is the foundation of acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be peace and growth in your life. Forgiveness is a big part of this process.  Forgiveness is the acceptance of the present moment, as it is, without attachment to any other time, place, or circumstance.  Almost all negativity is caused by a lack of forgiveness and denial of the present.  Unease, anxiety, guilt, tension, stress, worry, and resentment – all forms of unhealthy attachment – are caused by too much past and future, and not enough presence. There are specific disciplines and ways of seeing the world that you have to understand before you can awaken to a simpler, happier life.  As Einstein once said, “Out of clutter, find simplicity; from discord, find harmony; in the middle of difficulty, lies opportunity.” Sometimes we make life more complicated than it is.  We attach our happiness to achievement and then look for it in all the wrong ways and in all the wrong places.  Of course, you don’t have to live like this.  If you feel like you are, it’s time to simplify things.  It’s time to clear the air and get back to the basics. Simplifying is not seeing how little you can get by with – that’s poverty – but how efficiently you can put first things first, and use your time accordingly to pursue the things that make a difference and mean the most to you.  Less really is more.  Instead of adding, improve your life by subtracting.  Get rid of unnecessary clutter, negative influences and toxic relationships.  There is a big difference between what you want and what you need, between what’s excessive and what’s essential.  (Angel and I discuss this process in the Simplicity chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Life is kind of like climbing a ladder; you can climb the ladder as fast as you want, but it’s going to be a stressful waste of time if you get to the top and realize you’re leaning against the wrong wall.  You need to get this step in your life right to ensure that you are not wasting your energy on goals that you do not truly want to achieve.  Make sure your goals are truly YOURS, and in line with your values.  If you’re striving for someone else’s goals you are never going to be motivated or happy pursuing them. So the key is to figure out a few things that you truly want, and make sure you truly understand why you want these things.  Then write your mission statement.  It’s not just about setting goals; it’s a big picture project that helps you figure out who you are, what you represent, and where you intend to go in life.  It’s your personal manifesto – a framework for determining your actions, priorities, and opportunities. Establish goals that inspire you even if they seem slightly out of reach at the moment.  If you set goals that are too easy to achieve, you likely achieve far less than you are capable of.  As Les Brown so profoundly said, “Shoot for the moon, and if you miss you will still be standing among the stars.” Sometimes you just need to rest, think and be thankful.  Go ahead and withdraw from the cares of the world that will not withdraw from you. Every person needs some time away – a few calm moments every day to consciously separate the productive from the busy and the past from the present.  Commitments, obligations, family, employers and friends can exist during this time frame without you.  You deserve this time away in which no problems are faced and no solutions explored. Remember that rest is part of growing and getting stronger.  Your body and mind need to shut down every now and then to recuperate.  It’s simple: slow down, breathe and get more sleep.  Results = work + rest. Create healthy habits for downtime.  No screens within 30 minutes of bedtime.  Drink decaffeinated tea instead of coffee and soda.  Decompress by writing, reading or meditating.  Get at least seven hours of sleep to rejuvenate your mind and muscles.  Etc.  (Read The Power of Less.) Drugs are a waste of time. They destroy your body and mind, your self-respect and everything good that goes along with your self-esteem. People use drugs, legal and illegal, because the lives they choose to live are intolerably dull and unhappy.  They hate their surroundings, their work and routines and find no comfort in their leisure activities.  They are estranged from their true friends, families and passions, and yet they still find time to chat with a stranger at a bar about matters of insignificance.  It should tell you something, that many forms of drug use in our society are socially acceptable and socially promoted, whereas this same level of consumption among our moments of solitude are often lonely and shameful.  We need drugs, apparently, because we have lost touch with our true selves and each other. Forget the drugs.  Focus on reality.  Feel your true senses and use them to fuel your journey. Health can make or break your happiness and potential for success.  You have to feed your body what it needs – REAL food.  You don’t have to be a vegan, go Paleo, or keep up with a crazy diet to be healthy.  Just eat high quality, nutritious foods and eliminate sugars and processed garbage.  Eat foods that come from the Earth, not out of some machine or chemistry set. Also, practice mindful eating.  Don’t dine in front of the television.  No eating straight out of the bag either.  Make yourself a plate and measure out reasonable portions.  Try to savor or at least taste what you are eating.  Use smaller plates and drink more water to prevent overeating. Move and you will be rewarded with energy, confidence and clear thinking. Regardless of the size and shape of your body, it is the greatest tool you will ever own and the only place you ever truly live.  Without it, you wouldn’t be alive.  How you take care of it or fail to take care of it can make an enormous difference in the quality of your life. Studies have shown that exercising for fifteen minutes, three days each week, can add three years to your life.  And it will also help you feel darn good about yourself, because a fit, healthy body is by far the most attractive fashion statement.  (Read The 4-Hour Body.) There is no secret to success, health or happiness, except doing the work.  Don’t ask for permission or apologize for wanting to pursue a meaningful goal; just pursue it already.   Be confident in your abilities and clueless to the idea that failure is an option.  Learn as you go.  Fail forward. The world needs your ideas, your art, and your work.  If you are holding back because you’re scared, you’re not just letting yourself down; you’re letting us all down.  Forget about critics and pessimists; share your intelligence and unique perspectives.  Once you do, and the hustle gets in your veins, failure will cease to be relevant. Be willing to do the work because you believe in it, because you can, because it’s the right thing to do.  Persist despite uncertainties and second-guessing.  Do it consistently today, tomorrow and every day thereafter. Walk the talk.  Actions speak so much louder than words.  Stop talking about all of the great ideas you have and DO something EPIC.  Explanations and justifications are useless when actions and results speak for themselves.

Photo by: Bart 8 Good Morning Questions that Create Happiness|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/8-morning-questions.jpg?resize=500%2C332&ssl=1| The morning is extremely important.  It is the foundation from which the day is built.  How you choose to spend your morning can be used to predict what kind of day you’re going to have. Do you need help focusing on what matters most? If you think happiness and success means making lots of money and buying lots of stuff, the answer to this question is yes. Dirty, wrinkled sketches of dead presidents have never made anyone happy in the long run.  And how can you expect to be successful if you’re not happy?  Money helps along the way, but only you can make yourself happy and successful from the inside out.  There isn’t any amount of money that can buy that. Real happiness and success comes from the quality of your attitude, your relationships, and the emotions you experience each day.  That’s where the questions below come in.  Ask yourself these questions every morning and I absolutely guarantee that your days will get happier and more prolific over time: If you don’t take good care of yourself, then you can’t take good care of others either; which is why taking care of yourself is the best selfish thing you can do. Every new day is a chance to change your life.  Work on making life all that you want it to be.  Work hard for what you believe, and keep your dreams big and your worries small.  Figure out how you can best serve yourself today. Remember, you never need to carry more than you can hold, just take one small step at a time.  And while you’re out there today making decisions instead of excuses, learning new things, and getting closer and closer to your goals, know that there are others out there, like me, who admire your efforts and are striving for greatness too. You don’t need to be perfect to be a perfect friend or lover, but the commitment to your relationship is a precious responsibility.  Relationships last a lifetime only when two people make a deliberate choice to keep it, fight for it, and work for it.  These acts of love don’t need to be extravagant either; they just need to be true.  And true love is always shown in deeds, not just words. Also, remember that it’s not so much about what you do for your loved ones as it is about the love you put into what you do for them.  Learn what matters most to them and make a habit of it.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) “People often say that motivation doesn’t last.  Well, neither does bathing, that’s why we recommend it daily.”  Zig Ziglar said that, and nothing could be closer to the truth. To accomplish great things, you must not only act, but also dream, not only plan, but also believe.  Be a dreamer, a believer, and a courageous and cheerful thinker.  Be a positive motivator, a productive doer, and a go-getter who keeps her head in the clouds and her feet on the ground.  Let the spirit of passion and possibility ignite a fire within you to do something worthwhile today, and don’t forget to spread your enthusiasm to those around you. Being a genuinely good person, helping others, and leaving the world better than you found it is what a truly rich life is.  Knowing deep down that you counted – that someone else’s life would not have been as well off without you in it – that’s priceless.  That’s something worth working for. There are many small, simple actions you can make to profoundly impact your family, your community, and the world.   So do your best to leave everything you touch today a little better than you found it. You have your own way.  For you, this way of living is the absolute right way.  Honor it. One of the most influential sources of peace is simply being comfortable with who you really are.  Not trading your reality for a role, or your truth for an act.  Not giving up your freedom of thought.  Not putting on a mask. There cannot be peace in your external life until you are at peace within yourself, being yourself.  It won’t always be easy, but no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning your inner spirit.  (Read The Untethered Soul.) Is it telling you to go against the grain?  Is it urging you to do something differently?  It’s okay to listen to the advice of others, but don’t forget to check in with your own intuition.  If it leads you off the well worn path today, so be it. Don’t apologize for what you feel and what you don’t feel; that’s a betrayal of your truth.  No matter how much advice people give you, sometimes you have to feel things out for yourself, make decisions on your own, experience things firsthand, and build your own conclusions from the ground up the old fashion way. As Socrates once said, “Contentment is natural wealth, luxury is artificial poverty.” Do not waste all your happiness by overlooking everything you have for everything you wish you had.  If you do, you will never have enough.  Instead, appreciate the goodness that is already yours, and you will instantly find a lot more to smile about. Appreciate the good people and things around you, and you’ll soon find many more of them around you.  Truly appreciate your life, and you’ll find that you have more of it to live.  (Read Learned Optimism.) Do something worth remembering.  Try something new.  Express your love.  Live your truth.  Share your enthusiasm.  Take action towards meaningful goals.  Walk your talk.  Embrace your gifts.  Bounce to the beat of your own drum. Do whatever it takes to make today a good memory. Remember, asking the right questions is the answer, because the questions you ask yourself on a daily basis determine your focus, and your focus determines your end results.  So ask yourself the questions above every morning and watch as the rest of your day falls into place. I would love to hear your perspective on the final question: What would YOU like to remember about today? Please leave a comment below and share your thoughts with the community.

JoyBell C. Even after you let go, the past is still part of who you are.  Every one of us lives in the present and makes choices based on some part of the past.  This fact is simply unavoidable.  You are only able to read these words right now because of your past.  Your brain relates past experiences (or learned knowledge) to these words. All forms of learning rely on your ability to continually reference the past.  If you think about it, many wise decisions you have made leading to this very moment were created through recalling what did or did not work in the past.  You are only able to do what you can now because of what you learned.  For instance, you only recognize a friend when she walks into the room because you reference a past connection with her.  In this way, you are using the past effectively. But when you start behaving ineffectively because you think, “this is the way it has always been,” problems arise.  Old traditions may be useful, or they may stifle your progress and growth.  It all depends on how relevant they are to the present.  It’s your job to make this determination. We talk about letting go of the past and moving on, but what do we really need to leave behind?  Since the past helps us at least as much as it hurts us, how do we know which pieces to discard? Here are some things I have learned that have helped me: When an experience in your life has emotional significance, it gets tagged in your brain as being important.  When the emotional experience is tragic, it triggers your brain’s fear mechanism, which tells your brain to remain on the lookout for any future conditions that vaguely remind you of this tragic experience (it does this to protect you from future harm).  Your brain then tries to match new experiences with the original one.  But depending on how emotionally attached you are to the original experience, it can lead to ‘false pattern matches’ which will inevitably lead you astray. For example: Again, these false pattern matches occur whenever you respond negatively and over-emotionally to a particular experience.  And it all happens subconsciously too.  Logically, you know that all muscular men are completely different human beings, but emotionally you respond as if they are one. If you feel that you are stuck because you can’t move beyond a past experience, then your brain is relating to it as if it’s still happening right now, which means it’s matching patterns improperly in the present.  Here’s a two-step solution that might help: Zookeepers typically strap a thin metal chain to a grown elephant’s leg, and then attach the other end to a small wooden peg that’s hammered into the ground.  The 10-foot tall, 10,000-pound elephant could easily snap the chain and uproot the wooden peg, and escape to freedom with minimal effort.  But it doesn’t.  In fact the elephant never even tries.  The world’s most powerful land animal, which can uproot a tree as easily as you could break a toothpick, remains defeated by a small wooden peg and a flimsy chain. Why? Because when the elephant was a baby, its trainers used the exact same methods to domesticate it.  A thin chain was strapped around its leg and the other end of the chain was tied to a wooden peg in the ground.  At the time, the chain and peg were strong enough to restrain the baby elephant.  When it tried to break away, the metal chain would pull it back.  Sometimes, tempted by the world it could see in the distance, the elephant would pull harder.  But the chain would not budge, and soon the baby elephant realized trying to escape was not possible.  So it stopped trying. And now that the elephant is all grown up, it sees the chain and the peg and it remembers what it learned as a baby – the chain and peg are impossible to escape.  Of course, this is no longer true, but it doesn’t matter.  It doesn’t matter that the 200-pound baby is now a 10,000 pound powerhouse.  The elephant’s self-limiting beliefs prevail. If you think about it, we are all like elephants.  We all have incredible power inside us.  And of course, we have our own chains and pegs – the self-limiting beliefs that hold us back.  Sometimes it’s a childhood experience or an early failure.  Sometimes it’s something we were told when we were younger.  We need to learn from the past, but be ready to update what we learned based on how our circumstances have changed (as they constantly do). Here are two things to consider: Nothing starts easy; everything begins at some level of difficulty.  Even waking up in the morning sometimes requires notable effort.  But one beautiful thing about life is the fact that the most difficult challenges are often the most rewarding and satisfying in the long run. The really tough job interviews that lead to huge career advancements.  The first few awkward words exchanged on first dates that lead to successful relationships.  The excruciating training that leads hopeful Olympians to gold medal placements.  None of these successful outcomes started from a place of comfort and ease. Far too many people are fearful of the unknown, comfy with putting in the least amount of effort, and not willing to put up with short-term pain for long-term gain.  Don’t be one of them – you know better than that.  You know that growth and progress require discomfort.  Every time you stretch your emotional, intellectual, and physical muscle groups, discomfort arises just before progress is made. In all walks of life, by committing to continuous, small uncomfortable steps forward, you are able to sidestep the biggest barrier to positive change:  Fear. Also, remember that growth begins at the end of your comfort zone.  Not only is it important to accept the discomfort of taking steps forward, it is also necessary to let go of comfortable routines and situations from the past.  Holding on to the way things were, prevents you from growing into who you are now, and who you are capable of being.  (Angel and I discuss in more detail in the “Goals and Success” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Reminiscing about great past times is always a pleasure, so long as reviewing these past times is not used as a way of emphasizing how terrible the present is by contrast.  If you start living in the past to such a great extent that the opportunities in the present are ignored, you have a problem.  For instance, if you don’t even give a potential new partner a chance simply because you “know” they could never live up to your perfect lover from the past… this is a huge warning sign. Feeling that the past was a golden age of seamless perfection – a time of infinite happiness – is not an accurate assessment of reality.  Comparing this idealized retrospection with the present can lead you to believe the present can never be a happy place, thus preventing you from enjoying the moment and looking forward to the next. Here are two practices that might be helpful: The bottom line is that life needs to continue right up until the moment you die.  If at a certain point all you do is look back, you have, in effect, stopped living.  You need to resist the trap of believing the past was so perfect that the present cannot be appreciated at all.  (Read Authentic Happiness.) You need to understand that none of us are playing with marked cards; sometimes we win and sometimes we lose.  Life always finds its balance.  Don’t expect to get back everything you give.  Don’t expect recognition for every effort you make.  And don’t expect your genius to be instantly recognized or your love to be understood by everyone you encounter. There are things you don’t want to happen, but have to accept, things you don’t want to know, but have to learn, and people and circumstances you can’t live without but have to let go.  Some things come into your life just to strengthen you, so you can move on without them. As you live and experience things, you must recognize what belongs and what doesn’t, what works and what doesn’t, and then let things go when you know you should.  Not out of pride, inability, or arrogance, but simply because not everything is supposed to fit into your life.  So close the door on the past, change the tune, clean your inner space, and get rid of the dust.  Stop being who you once were so you can become who you are today. It’s time to open the next chapter of your life. Oftentimes letting go has nothing to do with weakness, and everything to do with strength.  We let go and move on with our lives not because we want the friends, family, and the universe to realize our worth, but because we finally realize our own worth. So stop focusing on the negatives and everything that could go wrong, and start thinking of what could go right.  Better yet, think of everything that already is right.  Be thankful for nights that turned into mornings, friends that turned into family, and past dreams and goals that turned into realities.  And use this mindset of positivity to fuel an even brighter today and tomorrow. What would you add to the list?  What have you had to let go of, and what did it teach you?  Please share your insights with the community by leaving a comment below.

Over the years, Angel and I have helped thousands of unhappy people rediscover their smiles, and, in the process, we’ve learned a lot about the negative beliefs and behaviors that typically hold them back.  Even if you are generally a happy person, take a look at the list below.  Many of the unhappy people we’ve worked with initially refused to admit that they carried these beliefs and behaviors, even when the evidence stacked against them was undeniable.  See if any of these points are keeping you from experiencing greater amounts of joy. Decide this minute to never again beg anyone for the love, respect, and attention that you should be showing yourself.  Be your own best friend.  Trust your inner spirit and follow your instincts.  Accept who you are completely, the good and the bad, and make changes in your life as YOU see fit – not because you think anyone else wants you to be different, but because you know it’s the right thing to do, for YOU. Be the person you will be happy to live with for the duration of your life.  Don’t rely on your significant other, or anyone else, for your happiness and self-worth.  Know that our first and last love is always self-love, and that if you can’t love and respect yourself, no one else will be able to either. The minute you stop overwhelming your mind with caring about what everyone else thinks, and start doing what you feel in your heart is right, is the minute you will finally feel freedom and peace of mind.  In fact, you can end half your troubles immediately by no longer permitting people to tell you what you want. You have to put your life in your own hands.  Others may be able hold your happiness hostage temporarily, but only you can do it permanently.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” and “Happiness” chapters of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) You will never find peace until you learn to finally let go of the hatred and hurt that lives in your heart.  Life is far too short to be spent in nursing bitterness and registering wrongs.  Grudges are for those who insist that they are owed something; forgiveness, on the other hand, is for those who are confident enough to stand on their own two legs and move on. In order to move on, you must know why you felt the way you did, and why you no longer need to feel that way.  It’s about accepting the past, letting it be, and pushing your spirit forward with good intentions.  Nothing empowers your ability to heal and grow as much as your love and forgiveness. Remember that the way you’ve always done it isn’t the only way.  It’s unlikely that one of the things you’ll regret when you’re 70 is not having consumed enough beer in your 20s, or not having bought enough $6 lattes from Starbucks, or not having frequented the same night club for years.  But the regret of missing out on opportunities is a real, toxic feeling. The bottom line is that you’ve figured out drinking and going out.  You’ve had enough lattes.  It’s time to figure something else out.  Every corner you turn or street you walk down has a new experience waiting for you.  You just have to see the opportunity and be adventurous enough to run with it.  (Read Eat, Pray, Love.) Life is often unpredictable.  Some of the great moments in your life won’t necessarily be the things you do; they’ll be things that happen to you.  That doesn’t mean you can’t take action to affect the outcome of your life.  You have to take action, and you will.  But don’t forget that on any day, you can step out the front door and your whole life can change in an instant – for better or worse. To an extent, the universe has a plan that’s always in motion.  A butterfly flaps its wings and it starts to rain – it’s a scary thought, but it’s part of life’s cycle.  All these little parts of the machine, constantly working – sometimes forcing you to struggle, and sometimes making sure you end up exactly in the right place at the right time. “Numbing” is any activity that you use to desensitize your feelings so that you don’t experience vulnerability or hurt.  But by numbing yourself to vulnerability, you also numb yourself to love, belonging, empathy, creativity, adventure and all of life’s goodness. Remember, every worthwhile venture in life – intimate love, friendship, a new business, etc. – is scary.  These things are inherently risky.  They are unsafe.  These things aren’t for the faint of heart.  They take courage.  And most importantly, they can’t coexist with fear.  When you open up to life’s greatest opportunities and joys it means you’re also giving life the opportunity to break your heart, but trusting that it won’t… that the risk is well worth the reward. This is something we all struggle with sometimes.  It’s also the root cause of nearly all of our unhappiness. One of the hardest challenges we face in life is to simply live in our own skin – to just be right here, right now, regardless of where we are.  Too often we needlessly distract ourselves with anything and everything: food, booze, shopping, television, tabloid news, online social networks, video games, cell phones, iPods, etc. – basically anything to keep us from being fully present in the current moment. We use compulsive work, compulsive exercise, compulsive love affairs, and the like, to escape from ourselves and the realities of living.  In fact, many of us will go to great lengths to avoid the feeling of being alone in an undistracted environment.  So we succumb to hanging-out with just about anybody to avoid the feeling of solitude.  For being alone means dealing with our true feelings: fear, anxiety, happiness, anger, joy, resentment, disappointment, anticipation, sadness, excitement, despair, and so on and so forth. And it doesn’t really matter if our feelings are positive or negative – they are overwhelming and exhausting, and so we prefer to numb ourselves to them.  The bottom line is that we are all addicted to avoiding ourselves.  Acknowledging this addiction is the first step to healing it.  So begin today by just noticing with curiosity, and without judgment, all of the ways in which you avoid being in your own skin, right here, right now, in this present moment we call life.  (Read The Power of Now.) If you feel anxious because you constantly feel like you’re missing out on something happening somewhere else, you’re not alone.  We all feel this way sometimes – like the grass is greener somewhere else at this very moment.  But let me assure you, you could run around trying to do everything, and travel around the world, and always stay connected, and work and party all night long without sleep, but you could never do it all.  You will always be missing something, and thus it will always seem like something wonderful might be happening elsewhere. So let it go, and realize you have everything right now.  The best in life isn’t somewhere else; it’s right where you are, at this moment.  Celebrate the perhaps not so insignificant fact that you are alive right now.  This moment, and who you are, is absolutely perfect.  Take a deep breath, smile, and notice the green grass under your own two feet. Let me tell you a secret I’ve learned about happiness.  Nobody is happy all of the time.  It’s perfectly normal to experience considerable fluctuations in your level of happiness from day to day, month to month, and even year to year.  In fact, according to a recent scientific study, overall levels of happiness decline from one’s teens until one’s 40s and then pick up again until they peak in one’s early 70s.  So the chances are that your happiest days are yet to come.  Hopefully that gives you something to smile about today.

"7 Ways to Stop Fearing What Everyone Thinks of You|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-stop-fearing-thinks.jpg?resize=500%2C447&ssl=1| The unhappiest people in this world are the people whocare the most about what everyone else thinks. “What’s wrong with wanting to please others?” That’s what several people asked me via email in response to one of my recent articles.  Today, I want to discuss why it’s not healthy to try to please everyone, and how to stop yourself from doing so. Seeking approval from others is perfectly fine up until the point where you are compromising your health and happiness in the process.  It becomes a serious problem if you feel as though widespread positive approval from others is the very oxygen you need to breathe.  There was a time in my life when I felt exactly this way. I literally felt like I was short of breath – almost as if I’d die if my peers didn’t approve of me.  This is a condition that developed in my mind when I was very young, after kids in grade school teased me for being a “nerd.”  I did everything I could to win their approval.  And although I grew out of my awkward stage pretty early in my teenage years, the damage was done – I was left feeling insecure.  I was conditioned to seek and beg for outside approval at all times. The big problem was that, as a twenty-something college graduate entering the work force, I felt that anything I did or even thought only had validity if it was the “right thing” to say and think.  And by “right thing,” what I really mean is “what other people thought was right.”  I was terrified to step outside the box of acceptability – which was especially harmful to my creativity as I tried to nurture my passion for writing and blogging. Once I realized what I was doing, I read several books, spoke with a coach, and focused diligently on healing this broken part of myself. The bottom line is that constant approval-seeking forces you to miss out on the beauty of simply being yourself, with your own unique ideas and desires.  If you are led through life only doing and being what you’ve come to believe is expected of you, then, in a way, you cease to live. So how can you stop fearing what everyone thinks of you?  Let’s take a look: When I first started writing on this blog, I’d agonize over whether people would think what I was writing was good enough.  I desperately hoped they’d like it, and oftentimes I’d catch myself imagining they didn’t.  Then one day I realized how much energy I was wasting worrying about it.  So I’ve gradually learned to relax with simply not knowing. Some problems in life, such as not knowing what others think of you, are not really meant to be resolved.  How people perceive you may have more to do with them than you anyway.  They may even like or dislike you simply because you’ve triggered an association in their minds by reminding them of someone they liked or disliked from their past, which has absolutely nothing to do with you. So here’s a new mantra for you – say it, and then say it again: “This is my life, my choices, my mistakes and my lessons.  As long as I’m not hurting people, I need not worry what they think of me.”  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” and “Relationships” chapters of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.”) Ethel Barrett once said, “We would worry less about what others think of us if we realized how seldom they do.”  Nothing could be closer to the truth. Forget what everyone else thinks of you; chances are, they aren’t thinking about you anyway.  If you feel like they always are, understand that this perception of them watching you and critiquing your every move is a complete figment of your imagination.  It’s your own inner fears and insecurities that are creating this illusion.  It’s you judging yourself that’s the problem. How many times have you looked at a person and initially misjudged their brilliance?  Appearances are deceptive.  How you seem to someone and how you actually are rarely congruent.  Even if they get the basic gist of who you are, they’re still missing a big piece of the puzzle.  What someone thinks of you will rarely contain the whole truth, which is fine. If someone forms an opinion of you based on superficialities, then it’s up to them, not you, to reform those opinions based on a more objective and rational viewpoint.  Leave it to them to worry about – that is, if they even have an opinion at all. Bottom line:  The opinions other people have about you is their problem, not yours.  The less you worry about what they think of you, the less complicated your life becomes.  (Read The Four Agreements.) People will think what they want to think.  No matter how carefully you choose your words and mannerisms, there’s always a good chance they’ll be misinterpreted and twisted upside down by someone.  Does this really matter in the grand scheme of things?  No, it doesn’t. How others see you is not important.  How you see yourself means the world.  When you’re making big decisions, remember, what you think of yourself and your life is more important than what people think of you.  Stay true to YOU.  Never be ashamed of doing what feels right.  Decide what you think is right and stick to it. If you’re thinking like everyone else, you aren’t thinking.  And if you aren’t thinking, you aren’t truly living. It’s human nature to attempt to mimic other humans we look up to – perhaps a parental figure or a celebrity – especially when we are feeling insecure in our own skin.  But attempting to be someone else will always leave us feeling empty inside.  Why?  Because what we appreciate about the people we admire is their individuality – the qualities that make them unique.  To really copy them, we need to develop our own individuality, and in that way, we would actually be less like them and more like our true selves. We all have quirks and unique perspectives.  The more relaxed you become with your own differences, the more comfortable you will start to feel just being YOU.  Celebrate being different, off the beaten path, a little on the weird side… your own special creation.  If you find yourself feeling like a fish out of water, by all means find a new river to swim in.  But DO NOT change who you are; BE who you are.  (Read The Road Less Traveled.) It’s OK to know how you do not want to feel, but that’s not all you should be thinking about.  Imagine someone trying to learn to read by spending all their time focusing on how they do not want to not be able to read.  It doesn’t really make any sense, does it? Enough is enough!  Forget what you do not want to feel for a moment.  Work out how you DO want to feel right now in the present moment.  Train yourself to live right here, right now without regretting how others once made you feel, or fearing the possibility of future judgment. If you were delivering life-saving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on your mom in public, you’d be 100% focused and present.  You wouldn’t be thinking about what bystanders thought of your hair, your body type, or the brand of jeans you were wearing.  All these inconsequential details would vanish from your consciousness.  The intensity of the situation would motivate you to choose not to care about what others might be thinking of you.  This proves, quite simply, that thinking about what others are thinking about you is YOUR CHOICE. Speak your truth even if your voice shakes.  Be cordial and reasonable, of course, but don’t tread carefully on every word you say.  Push your concerns of what others might think aside.  Let the consequences of doing so unravel naturally.  What you’ll find is that most of the time no one will be offended or irritated at all.  And if they do get upset, it’s likely only because you’ve started behaving in a way that makes them feel they have less power over you. Think about it.  Why be fake? In the end, the truth usually comes out one way or the other, and when that happens, you’re standing alone if you’ve been living a lie.  So live your whole truth starting now.  If someone gives you a hard time and says, “You’ve changed,” it’s not a bad thing.  It just means you stopped living your life their way.  Don’t apologize for it.  Instead, be open and sincere, explain how you feel, and keep doing what you know in your heart is right. A life spent ceaselessly trying to please people who, perhaps, are incapable of ever being pleased, or trying too hard to always be seen as doing “the right thing,” is a sure road to a regretful existence. Do more than just exist.  We all exist.  The question is:  Do you live? I eventually realized existing without ever truly living was not what I wanted for myself.  So I made changes – I implemented all seven of the points discussed in this article and never looked back.  If you are in the same place I once was, seeking approval from everyone for every little thing you do, please take this post to heart and start making changes today.  Life is too short not to. How has the fear of what other people think interfered with your life?  What has it stopped you from doing?  How have you coped?  Leave a comment below and share your insights with us.

This afternoon when I sat down to write, I immediately thought about my joyful encounter this morning, and the first thing that came to mind was, “That wonderful lady really took a chance on me.”  Which got me thinking about all the chances we have to make our lives a little brighter and happier, and how many of these chances we never take. So if you’ve been feeling a bit unhappy lately, it might be time to… The happiest and most successful people are always looking for ways to help others.  The unhappiest and most unsuccessful people are still asking, “What’s in it for me?” Ultimately, your greatest successes in life will not be measured by how high you have climbed, but by how many people you have helped up with you.  This is how success leads to happiness.  What goes around comes around.  It’s impossible to not feel good when you are doing good for others. Today, help those around you and celebrate their strengths.  Lift them up and help them thrive.  When you choose to see and support the best in others, you end up finding the best in yourself. Be strong enough to let go and wise enough to fight for what you deserve.  Sometimes you have to get knocked down lower than you have ever been to stand up taller than you ever were before.  Sometimes your eyes need to be washed by your tears so you can see the possibilities in front of you with a clearer vision again.  Don’t settle. Keep up your dignity and always be true to yourself.  Truly loving yourself involves faith and trust and belief in who you are, and a willingness to act upon it.  So stop daydreaming and start DOING.  Develop a backbone, not a wishbone.  Take full responsibility for your life – take control.  You are important and you are needed.  It’s too late to sit around and wait for somebody to do something someday.  Someday is now, and the somebody the world needs is YOU.  (Angel and I cover this in more detail in the “Self-Love” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) If you always look for perfection, you’ll always look unhappy.  When you stop expecting people and situations to be perfect, you can start to appreciate them for who and what they are.  Imperfections are important, and so are mistakes.  We get to be good by learning from our mistakes and we get to be real by being imperfect. Today, be tolerant of people’s mistakes.  Sometimes good people make bad choices.  It doesn’t mean they’re bad; it simply means they’re human. Likewise, learn to walk in your own shoes imperfectly.  If you want to truly grow into your best self, let go of the notion of perfection and replace it with the notion of endless playful exploration.  It is better to live your own destiny honestly, joyfully and imperfectly, than to live up to one of society’s contrived expectations with perfection. Endless worry and rumination are the enemies to living in the present moment.  The search for happiness is sometimes the main reason for unhappiness.  Enjoy your life today; don’t wish it away by waiting for better days ahead.  Accept and appreciate things now, and you’ll find more happiness in every moment you live. If you are feeling down right now, each second that passes is another moment to turn it all around.  Feelings, good and bad, always come and go.  The trick is to be grateful when your mood is high and graceful when it is low.  Every day may not be good, but there’s something good about every day.  Appreciating these good things is what makes a good life in the end.  (Read The Power of Now.) Happiness comes more easily when you feel good about yourself without feeling the need for anyone else’s approval.  As long as you are worried about what others think of you, in a way, you are owned by them.  Only when you require no approval can you truly own yourself. Listen to your soul.  Trust your intuition; it will rarely lead you astray.  If it doesn’t feel right in your gut, then it probably isn’t.  So stop worrying about what you’re supposed to do and start doing what you know is right.  No matter how you live, someone will be disappointed.  Just live your truth and be sure YOU aren’t the one who is disappointed in the end. Most of the good things you do will go unnoticed by others.  Do them anyway, because you will notice.  Many of the contributions you make will not be fully realized by others.  Make them anyway, because you realize they are the right things to do. It’s great when you receive recognition for the things you do, yet even when there is no possibility of recognition, YOU still recognize the reasons you are putting forth the effort.  Your honest, authentic view of yourself influences all that you do.  And that view is formed mainly during times when no one is watching.  Your life is a living expression of who you know yourself to be, regardless of what others think or see. We often keep our hearts and minds closed, not because we don’t trust others not to hurt us, leave us, or let us down, but because we don’t trust ourselves to survive the pain if they do.  How ironic, considering that only by opening up and suffering through this type of discomfort, do we come to realize our true strength and potential for peace of mind. Take any emotional feeling – love for a significant other, or grief over a lost family member, or fear and pain from a deadly illness.  If you hold back on your emotions and you don’t allow yourself to go all the way through them, you can never get to the point of being detached from them.  In other words, if you spend all your energy being afraid of feeling your true emotions – the vulnerability that love, sincerity and acceptance entails – you will be forever stuck. But by throwing yourself into these emotions, by allowing yourself to fully embrace them to the point where you’re effectively in over your head, you leave no emotion abandoned or question lingering in your mind.  You know what love is.  You know what grief is.  You know what fear is.  And only when you know these things can you say, “I’m OK.”  (Read Daring Greatly.) We all need second chances.  This isn’t a perfect world.  We’re not perfect people.  I’m probably on my 1,000th second chance right now and I’m not ashamed to admit it.  Because even though I’ve failed a lot, it means I’ve tried a lot too. Most of the time the only difference between winning and losing is not quitting.  We rarely get things right the first time.  Almost every major accomplishment in a person’s life starts with the decision to try again and again – to get up after every failed attempt and give it another shot. Live, learn, and let go.  Don’t hold yourself down with the things you can’t control.  Don’t carry your mistakes around with you.  Instead, place them under your feet and use them as stepping stones.  If you take another step, and another, you’ll be surprised to know how far you can go from the point you thought was the end.  Every moment gives you a new beginning and a new ending.  You get a second chance, every second.  Just because something doesn’t go as planned, doesn’t mean it wasn’t worth your while.  Sometimes you have to fail forward, by learning what doesn’t work to discover what does. Life is a journey that’s only traveled once; don’t waste it.  Today’s moments quickly become tomorrow’s memories.  Appreciate today for what it is and make your time count.  Make it memorable.  Don’t let your coulda’s and shoulda’s of yesterday determine your can’s and will’s of today.  Live your life so that you never have to regret the chances you never took, the love you never let in, and the gifts you never gave out.

Tempering your expectations of other people will greatly reduce unnecessary frustration and suffering, in both your life and theirs, and help you refocus on the things that truly matter. Which means it’s time to… You deserve to be happy.  You deserve to live a life you are excited about.  Don’t let the opinions of others make you forget that.  You are not in this world to live up to the expectations of others, nor should you feel that others are here to live up to yours.  In fact, the more you approve of your own decisions in life, the less approval you need from everyone else. You have to dare to be yourself, and follow you own intuition, however frightening or strange that may feel or prove to be.  Don’t compare yourself to others.  Don’t get discouraged by their progress or success.  Follow your own path and stay true to your own purpose.  Success is ultimately about spending your life happily in your own way. True strength is in the soul and spirit, not in muscles.  It’s about having faith and trust in who you are, and a willingness to act upon it.  Decide this minute to never again beg anyone for the love, respect, and attention that you should be showing yourself. Today, look at yourself in the mirror and say, “I love you, and from now on I’m going to act like it.”  It’s important to be nice to others, but it’s even more important to be nice to yourself.  When you practice self-love and self-respect, you give yourself the opportunity to be happy.  When you are happy, you become a better friend, a better family member, and a better YOU.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) You might feel unwanted and unworthy to one person, but you are priceless to another.  Don’t ever forget your worth.  Spend time with those who value you.  No matter how good you are to people, there will always be one negative person who criticizes you.  Smile, ignore them, and carry on. In this crazy world that’s trying to make you like everyone else, the toughest battle you’ll ever have to fight is the battle to be yourself.  And as you’re fighting back, not everyone will like you.  Sometimes people will call you names because you’re “different.”  But that’s perfectly OK.  The things that make you different are the things that make YOU, and the right people will love you for it. Loving and respecting others means allowing them to be themselves.  When you stop expecting people to be a certain way, you can begin to appreciate THEM. Pay close attention, and respect people for who they are and not for who you want them to be.  We don’t know most people half as well as we believe we do; and truly knowing someone is a big part of what makes them wonderful.  Every human being is remarkable and beautiful; it just takes a patient set of eyes to see it.  The more you get to know someone, the more you will be able to look beyond their appearance and see the beauty of who they truly are.  (Read The Mastery of Love.) People can’t read minds.  They will never know how you feel unless you tell them.  Your boss?  Yeah, he doesn’t know you’re hoping for a promotion because you haven’t told him yet.  That cute guy you haven’t talked to because you’re too shy?  Yeah, you guessed it, he hasn’t given you the time of day simply because you haven’t given him the time of day either. In life, you have to communicate with others regularly and effectively.  And often, you have to open your vocal cords and speak the first words.  You have to tell people what you’re thinking.  It’s as simple as that. If there’s a specific behavior someone you care about has that you’re hoping disappears over time, it probably won’t.  If you really need them to change something, be honest and put all the cards on the table so this person knows how you feel and what you need them to do. For the most part though, you can’t change people and you shouldn’t try.  Either you accept who they are or you choose to live without them.  It’s might sound harsh, but it’s not.  When you try to change people, they often remain the same, but when you don’t try to change them – when you support them and allow them the freedom to be as they are – they gradually change in the most beautiful way.  Because what really changes is the way you see them.  (Read A New Earth.) Be kinder than necessary, for everyone you meet is fighting some kind of battle, just like you.  Every smile or sign of strength hides an inner struggle every bit as complex and extraordinary as your own. Remember that embracing your light doesn’t mean ignoring your dark.  We are measured by our ability to overcome adversities and insecurities, not avoid them.  Supporting, sharing and making contributions to other people is one of life’s greatest rewards.  This happens naturally if we allow it, because we all share very similar dreams, needs and struggles.  Once we accept this, the world then is a place where we can look someone else in the eye and say, “I’m lost and struggling at the moment,” and they can nod and say, “Me too,” and that’s OK.  Because not being “OK” all the time, is perfectly OK. People rarely behave exactly the way you want them to.  Hope for the best, but expect less.  And remember, the magnitude of your happiness will be directly proportional to your thoughts and how you choose to think about things.  Even if a situation or relationship doesn’t work out at all, it’s still worth it if it made you feel something new, and if it taught you something new.

Tell the negativity committee that meets inside your head to sit down and shut up.  Don’t think yourself into a nervous breakdown, into depression, into hopeless defeat.  If you’re being negative when you’re alone, the warfare is in your mind.  The fight you’ve got to fight is in your mind.  You can’t change what has happened, but you can choose how you’re going to deal with it. Be wise enough to walk away from the negativity around you; don’t let it infect your thinking.  Don’t let someone else’s negative opinion ruin your reality.  No matter how much negativity is thrown at YOU by others, there is absolutely no need for you to stay put and partake in the decay they choose for their own lives.  YOU decide how your soul grows. When the people around you give you every reason to be negative, think of one good reason to be positive.  There’s always something to be grateful for.  Say it: “I am lucky to be alive! I am happy to be me!  I have so much to be grateful for!  My life isn’t perfect, it’s just pretty darn good!”  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” and “Relationships” chapters of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.”) Don’t confuse your path with your destination.  Just because it’s stormy now, doesn’t mean you aren’t headed for sunshine.  And remember, you cannot heal a lifetime of pain overnight; be patient with yourself, it takes as long as it takes, but your happiness is well worth the wait. You write your own destiny through the choices you make.  You become what you repeatedly do.  It is more important to know where you are going and why, than to get there quickly.  Do not mistake activity for achievement.  Every time you are tempted to react to the same old circumstances in the same old way, ask yourself, “Do I want to be a prisoner of the past, or a pioneer of the future?” Nothing worthwhile in life was meant to be easy; learn to take it easy with your expectations in this area.  Don’t expect things to be given to you.  Go out and achieve them!  It’s the only sane way to deal with life’s challenges.  If it’s worth having, it’s worth working for. Anyone can run away and waste away; it’s super easy to do nothing.  Facing challenges and working through them, that’s what makes you strong.  And even on your weakest days you get a bit stronger.  So today, stop wishing for it and start working for it.  Talk is cheap.  Action is priceless.  (Read Flourish.) Too many of us only take credit for positive outcomes.  In other words, we take full credit for our successes, but deny responsibility for our failures.  A perfect example of this can be witnessed in school classrooms across the globe.  When students receive a good grade, they often attribute it to their intelligence and their excellent study habits.  But when they get a bad grade, they attribute some of their failure to a bad teacher, an unfair set of test questions, or a subject matter that “isn’t needed in the real world anyway.” Realize that in order for you to grow emotionally, you must be willing to take full responsibility for all your actions and outcomes – successes and failures alike.  Because if you are too afraid of failure, you can’t possibly do what needs to be done to be successful.  Setbacks, failures, obstacles, and hardships are the contractors of life; they build character, strength and knowledge. Today, let your small annoyances go.  Move through your day consciously.  Make an effort to notice at least one insignificant little frustration that you would normally get frustrated about.  Then do yourself a favor and simply let it go.  Experience, in this little way, the freedom of being in control of the way you feel.  And realize that you can extend this same level of control to every situation you encounter in life. At any given moment, the way you feel is the way you choose to feel, and the way you react is the way you choose to react. Superficial judgments are made the instant one person assumes something about another person based on their immediate appearance.  Sadly, this likely happens thousands of times every minute, all around the world.   For example, someone might see a tall, well groomed man in his early fifties wearing a business suit, and instantly assume he is successful and reliable, even though there is zero concrete evidence to support this assumption. Bottom line:  Don’t judge a person by what they show you in a single glance.  What you’ve seen is oftentimes only what they have chosen to show you at that particular moment.  Too often we jump to conclusions.  Talk with people, listen to their stories, watch what they do – this is how you get to know who they truly are. Don’t try to diminish your losses from a past failure by continuing to follow the exact same path that led to the failure in the first place.  In other words, don’t do the same thing over and over again and expect different results.  If it didn’t work last time, and you haven’t made any significant changes, it probably won’t work this time either. Sometimes we justify our decision to continue investing in a failed endeavor based solely on our cumulative prior investment, despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, starting today, of continuing to pursue it outweighs the expected benefit.  The logical thing to do would be for us to cut our losses and change our course of action.  However, due to the sunk costs we have already invested, we feel committed to the endeavor, so we invest even more time, money and energy into it, hoping that our additional investment will reverse the outcome.  But most of the time it never will. When you can no longer think of a reason to continue, you must think of a reason to start over, and that’s perfectly OK.  There’s a big difference between giving up and starting over in the right direction.  (Read Daring Greatly.) Be done with regrets; they are an excuse for people who have given up.  You are still here trying and growing.  Life is about learning from the past, trusting your intuition going forward, taking chances, finding moments of happiness, and realizing everything is simply a lesson that happens for a reason. Don’t stress over what could’ve been; chances are if it should’ve been, it would’ve been.  Focus on the present; you have a lot to look forward to in it.  Just do your best.  Every moment gives you a new beginning and a new ending.  You get a second chance, every second.  And YOUR best chance is happening right NOW. The Dalai Lama once said, “A new way of thinking has become the necessary condition for responsible living and acting.  If we maintain obsolete values and beliefs, a fragmented consciousness and self-centered spirit, we will continue to hold onto outdated goals and behaviors.” Today, make it a point to defragment your consciousness and center your spirit on positive, productive thoughts.  Whatever you do, don’t get stuck on the one thing that ruins your day.  Smile and be grateful.  Life is too short to waste on negativity and destructive thinking.

Photo by: Martina Photography 10 Ways to Make the Rest of Today Amazing|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-make-today-amazing.jpg?resize=500%2C375&ssl=1| The beginning is always now. No matter what the history of your day has entailed thus far, the rest of your day depends on what you do right now.  Write it on your heart that the rest of today is going to be amazing.  Here are some ideas to help you make it so: Trying to micromanage every little thing every moment is stressful.  Life should be touched, not strangled.    Sometimes you’ve got to relax and let life happen without incessant worry and micromanagement. Starting now, let go before you squeeze too tight.  Take a deep breath.  When the dust settles and you can once again see the forest for the trees, take the next step forward.  You don’t have to know exactly where you’re going every single second to be headed somewhere great.  Everything in life is in perfect order whether you understand it yet or not.  It just takes some time to connect all the dots. You can’t go back to how things were, or how you thought they were supposed to be.  All you really have is now.  The smartest thing you can control in life is your reaction to what’s beyond your control.  Dwelling on negativity from the past simply contributes to its power.  So stop focusing on what happened and start focusing on what’s going to move you forward. Everyone’s life has positive and negative aspects – whether you’re happy and successful or not depends greatly on which aspects you focus on.  The best thing you can do now is to let go of what you can’t control, and invest your energy in the things you can. Putting something off instantly makes it harder and scarier.  What you don’t start today won’t be finished by tomorrow; and there’s nothing more stressful than the perpetual lingering of an unfinished task. You know that thing you’ve been meaning to do, but you keep putting it off and it keeps nagging at you from the back of your mind.  Stop the nagging by taking action now!  (Read Getting Things Done.) When you strike that fine balance between the challenge of an activity and your skill at performing it, when the rhythm of your work feels in sync with your purpose, when you know that what you’re doing makes a difference, you become absorbed in the task at hand to the point where time ceases to exist.  This is what true passion and happiness feels like. So is there anything you do on a regular basis that makes you forget what time it is? On your average day, flow experiences like these are those flashes of intense living when you’re engrossed in a meaningful task that makes you feel more alive.  These optimal experiences can happen when you’re engaged in work, paid or unpaid, that move you.  Work like this is something you should be pursuing for at least an hour on a daily basis. Step out of your comfort zone and try something totally new.  What have you wondered about doing, but haven’t had the courage or time to try?  Aim for something small that you can accomplish in an hour or less.  It can be a whole new activity or just a small experience, such as talking to a stranger. Variety truly is the spice of life.  You can see or do something a million times, but you can only see or do it for the first time once.  As a result, first time experiences often lift our spirits and our consciousness. So what’s new to YOU? There is no exercise better for the improvement of our world than reaching down on a daily basis to lift someone up.  Don’t wait for people to smile.  Show them how.  Do something nice for someone who has no way of paying you back.  Do it because you can, and because it makes the world a happier place. When you make a positive impact in someone else’s life, you also make a positive impact in your own life.  Do something that’s greater than you – something that helps someone else to be happy or to suffer less.  I promise, it will be an extremely rewarding experience.  And your small gesture just might touch a wound that only kindness can heal.  (Read The Happiness Project.) You can go through life and make new friends every year – every month practically – but there is no substitute for the few who truly improve you.  These aren’t the people who are simply nice to you; they’re the ones who help you uncover the things that are holding you back.  In subtle ways, they bring ideas to your attention that change your life.  These friends don’t just sit beside you unknowingly; they shake your world up, reveal your obstacles and weaknesses, and remain a part of your life because they care. Friends like this are the most important people you will ever meet because they tear down the invisible walls you have built in your mind.  In other words, they come into your life and reveal new, valuable layers of yourself that you would never have discovered without them. Spend some time chatting with one of these people today. You deserve some time every day in which worries don’t get in the way of your happiness.  Moments when, even if some people are insensitive or unkind around you, you’re not going to mind because you realize that the blessings you have received are far greater than the burdens you are dealing with.  You can create time like this for yourself today.  There is power in positivity. Think about the goodness.  Be grateful for all the blessings you already have.  We often take for granted the very things that most deserve our gratitude.  What if you gave someone a gift and they neglected to thank you for it?  Would you be likely to give them another one?  The daily events in your life respond the same way.  In order to attract more of the blessings that life has to offer, you must be grateful for what you already have. Yes, you have battles out in the world to fight, insecurities to overcome, loved ones to contend with, and goals to achieve, but a break from it all is necessary.  It’s perfectly healthy to pause and let the world spin without you for a while. Go ahead and set aside some “me time” to be alone with your own thoughts today.  Enjoy the space between the commotions.  Say nothing, think quietly, just be and breathe.  Give yourself an opportunity to discover who you really are, and to figure out why you truly are always alone… and why that’s perfectly OK.  (Marc and I discuss this in more detail in the “Self-Love” and “Happiness” chapters of “1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.”) I purposely left this point for last because it perfectly encompasses all the previous points.  Be present.  It’s being here now that’s important.  Don’t let your life slip by.  Pay attention to what’s happening in and around you; don’t just hurry through to the next thing. You can’t stop the future.  You can’t rewind the past.  The only way to live is to press play.  So instead of dwelling on what happened earlier today, or worrying about what might happen later on, just practice being and living in this moment.  This moment, after all, is the only time guaranteed to you.  Right now is all there ever truly is.  Right now is life.  Open your eyes so you don’t miss it. You are a work in progress; which means you get there a little at a time, not all at once.  The rest of today is a brand new day – a fresh start.  Replace negativity with positivity.  Think happy thoughts.  Exercise your mind and body.  Healthy is happy.  Inspire yourself.  Create.  Laugh.  Run.  Play.  Love.  Learn.  Give someone a compliment.  Perform a random act of kindness.  Take a chance on an idea you believe in. You have the opportunity to do these things every single day – to make the necessary changes and slowly become the person you want to be.  You just have to decide to do it.  Decide that today is the day.  Say it: “This is going to be my day, starting now!” What would you add to the list?  What’s one way to make the rest of today amazing?  Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

"5 Ways to Get Everything You Truly Need|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/5-everything-you-need.jpg?resize=500%2C325&ssl=1| “You can’t always get what you want, but if you trysometimes, you might find, you get what you need.”?Mick Jagger Too often we get so hung up on what we can’t have that we don’t think enough about whether we really want it, or even more importantly, whether we really need it.  In fact, we usually need much less than we think we do to be happy and successful in life.  It’s just a matter of living abundantly. That’s what this short article is about – how to live in such a way that you always get what you truly need. You can get almost everything in life you need if you simply help enough people around you get what they need.  The most prolific work is found in the challenge of helping someone who has less than you do.  It’s one of life’s great paradoxes; when you help others you end up benefiting as much if not more than those you have helped. If you feel stuck in your life because you have lost your direction, shift your focus from your circumstances to the circumstances of those around you.  As Gandhi once said, “The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.”  Instead of asking, “Why don’t I have what I need?” ask, “How can I help you get what you need?”  Find someone who could use an extra hand and make an offer they can’t refuse. Life is a circle – what goes around, comes around eventually.  Since so many people are out to only help themselves, when you genuinely seek to help others succeed in getting what they need, they will notice your presence.  These people will in turn fight to help you succeed in getting everything you need.  What you need becomes what they want most. Bottom line:  Live so that your life is not defined by what you have acquired, but by what you have given away… not by what is etched on a gravestone, but what is etched in the lives and hearts of those you have helped.  (Read The How of Happiness.) When deprived of passion and meaningful work, human beings lose their reason for living; they get lost and go frantically mad. Thus, a fulfilling life is lived by letting your interests and passions drive you forward, and then losing yourself in the journey of taking each required step. The same way your body responds to the right nutrients, your heart, mind and spirit also need nourishment.  You are able to get that nourishment when you indulge in meaningful work, because when you truly lose yourself in something that moves you, you will eventually find yourself there too. So never let the reality of what is, get in the way of what is possible.  Never give up on the things that make your heart skip a beat.  A focused human being driven by passion is always more powerful than the reality of the moment.  Express your love.  Live your truth.  Share your enthusiasm. Take action towards meaningful goals.  Walk your talk.  Embrace your gifts.  Bounce to the beat of your own drum.  Work on something worth remembering. What happens when people open their hearts and minds?  They experience.  They love.  They learn.  They grow.  That’s what vulnerability is – the openness to possibility.  Love is vulnerability.  Happiness is vulnerability.  The risk of being vulnerable is the price of opening yourself to beauty and opportunity. Being vulnerable is not about showing the parts of you that are polished; it’s about revealing the unpolished parts you would rather keep hidden from the world.  It’s showing up and letting yourself be fully seen.  It’s looking out into the world with an honest, open heart and saying, “This is me.  Take me or leave me.” The truth is, nothing worthwhile in this world is a safe bet.  Since love and happiness are born out of your willingness to be vulnerable, to be open to something wonderful that could be taken away from you, you must accept it.  Because when you hide from your vulnerability, you automatically hide from everything in life worth attaining. Be vulnerable.  Allow yourself to feel, to be open and authentic.  Tear down any emotional brick walls you have built around you and feel every unique emotion, both good and bad.  This is real life.  This is how you welcome new opportunities.  Vulnerability sounds like honesty and feels like courage.  Honesty and courage aren’t always the easiest choices, but they’re never the wrong ones.  (Read Daring Greatly.) Stop looking outside yourself for the answers.  Start asking yourself the right questions.  Voltaire once said, “Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers.”  This is such sound advice, because if you keep asking yourself the wrong questions, you will never get an answer you like. The questions you’re regularly exposed to have a powerful influence on the direction of your life.  And, not surprisingly, the questions you hear most often come directly from YOU.  What questions are you asking yourself?  Are they helping you better understand yourself?  Or are they sending you on a wild goose chase? The problem is that when you think you have to “look” for things in life like love, meaning, and inspiration, the “looking” implies that these things are somehow hiding behind some bushes somewhere, just waiting to be discovered.  So you start asking yourself questions that lead you further and further outside yourself, which is not where the answers you seek live. In life you have to create your own love, define your own meaning, and harbor your own inspiration.  This process starts on the inside, not somewhere else.  Much of this can be accomplished simply by asking yourself the right questions.  Start with these: Obviously, there are many other questions you can ask as well.  It’s all about self-inquiries that help you stay true to your principles, pursue your passions, grow through adversity, and add value to the world around you.  (Angel and I cover hundreds of important life questions as a theme that radiates through every chapter of our book, 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Whatever it is you need to achieve in life, take everything in stride, one tiny step at a time. Don’t build mountains in your mind.  Don’t try to conquer the world all at once.  When you seek instant gratification you make life unnecessarily painful and frustrating.  When you choose instead to treat each moment as an opportunity to make a small, positive, investment in the present moment, the rewards come naturally. Although each individual effort in each moment may seem to have an insignificant impact when you make it, at some point you’ll look back and realize the momentous impact these moments created once they were added together.  By moving at this sustainable pace, you’ll be able to continue moving forward for as long as it takes to get precisely where you need to go. Take a step now, then another, and keep on stepping.  You are responsible for getting what you need in life.  It always comes down to your actions in the present moment.  You choose: either action and results, or inaction and excuses.  You can’t have both. You may not feel like taking another step right now, and that’s fine.  Take a break, rest, and then take another step as soon as possible.  Know that the pain of discipline and persistence is far less than the pain of regret.  No one has ever given their needs their best shot and regretted it. What do we all need in life?  What are some other important steps that can help us get what we need?  Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.

But, we found a way. We pushed ourselves as hard as we could to take one tiny step every day—one journal entry, one 10-minute workout, one honest conversation, and so forth.  It wasn’t easy, but the tiny steps were manageable and we gradually grew stronger.  And believe it or not, that’s basically what I did again this morning.  I was desperately struggling to motivate myself for the past few days after a significant business opportunity fell through.  I was feeling utterly defeated.  So, I took the tiniest possible step.  Just turning on my laptop, opening up the word processing application, and writing a single sentence.  Such an action is so small as to seem insignificant, and yet so easy as to be possible when I was feeling desperate and defeated again this morning.  And it showed me that the next step was possible, and the next.  And the end result is the couple paragraphs you’ve just finished reading. Why am I telling you this? Because I know we all need a healthy reminder sometimes… to do the hard things we need to do to be happy.  The things that frighten us.  The things others can’t do for us.  The things that make the difference between existing and living—between knowing the path and walking the path—between a life of empty promises and defeat and one filled with renewed happiness, possibility and peace. And, along these lines, I have some great news: Marc and I wrote three bestselling books (one of them is a New York Times bestseller) to guide us—all of us—through that necessary journey of doing the hard things.  I sincerely wish I could have read these books over a decade ago.  In many ways, it would have saved me from myself.  It absolutely would have saved me from intense periods of darkness that were born primarily from my subconscious attempt to take the easy way out of the painful realities I faced. Watch what happened when Marc and I stepped into the Today Show studio recently to discuss the painful personal journey that inspired us to write…  The books are available to order together right now.  If you decide to order today, send me an email at [email protected] with your receipt information (just copy and paste or screenshot the finalized order details from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Audible, or wherever you choose to order the book.).  We’ve prepared a great digital bonus for you: a 30-point “daily reminders” book (I guarantee you’ll find immense value in this bonus). Also, watch the official Getting Back to Happy book trailer:  And yes, the new book shares the title of our renowned Getting Back to Happy course, but understandably, the book and the course are completely different educational tools. For example, our course is video based, includes live one-on-one Skype/FaceTime coaching with Marc and me, and has an active online support community. The Getting Back to Happy book is a smaller, self-paced resource you can hold in your hands and take with you wherever you go… something you can turn to in real time, offline, as you need it. Both tools—the course and the book—complement each other very well, but they are standalone. In the book, you will face the truth right from the get-go… You are not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or a week ago.  You are always growing.  Experiences don’t stop.  That’s life.  And the very experiences that seem so tough when you are going through them are the ones you will look back on with gratitude for how far you have come.  Of course, it takes practice to get there, emotionally and physically, and that’s why we wrote this for YOU. The goal of the book is not to get rid of all your negative thoughts, feelings and life situations.  That is impossible.  The goal is to change your response to them. Again, Getting Back to Happy is the book I wish Marc and I had when life’s biggest challenges came our way.  Filled with actionable steps for bouncing back from tough times and getting back on the road to happiness and success, this is a book to spark sustainable action—and to return to whenever needed.  Sharing never-before-published stories and strategies, the book shows how to harness the power of daily rituals, mindfulness, self-care, and more to shift our perspective—and our actions—in order to become our happiest and most effective selves. Order Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs today (and don’t forget to email me your receipt details, so we can send you the bonus books once they’re ready). And of course, if there’s anything else Marc and I can do to assist you, please don’t hesitate to email me ([email protected]). Sincerely hoping you’re looking forward to an inspired next step, Angel Chernoff(and Marc, too)🙂 8 Life Quotes and Tips to Make You Think|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/8-thought-provoking-quotes.jpg?resize=500%2C473&ssl=1| I love thought-provoking quotes – seemingly simple, yet interestingly profound phrases that have the power to get our minds thinking straight.  That’s what this short post is about.  Below I have listed eight of my favorite thought-provoking quotes, along with my interpretation and outlook on each one.  I hope you enjoy thinking about them as much as I do. “We can not solve our problems with thesame level of thinking that created them.”?Albert Einstein Realize that not all movement is progress.  When stress and tension and chaos surround you, pause for a moment and relax.  The best time to take a deep breath is when you don’t have time for it. Select a specific challenge, deal with it, and then move calmly and confidently to the next.  When you’re being pulled in multiple directions at once, take time to remember what you value most.  Focus on what’s most important to you and you’ll naturally direct your greatest energy to the right source. Life is filled with either problems or possibilities.  What you see is what you choose to see.  On the surface life can seem tumultuous and perplexing, yet deep inside, where it truly matters, life is what you make of it.  Choose to see beyond the problems to the possibilities that await your attention. “You cannot protect yourself from sadnesswithout protecting yourself from happiness.”?Jonathan Safran Foer Live every day of your life in full.  Experience the highs and the lows, the positives and the negatives, and all the moods present between the various extremes.  Don’t focus on simply being happy.  Focus on living a well-rounded, seasoned life.  Focus on achieving completeness.  Yes, happiness is part of this completeness, but so is sadness, difficulty, frustration, and failure.  And overcoming these latter points supports your personal growth far more than constant happiness. The feelings of happiness and fulfillment are nice when they happen, and they are needed, but they don’t strengthen you.  Instead of asking, “Is this making me happy?” ask, “Is this contributing to my completeness?”  If you’re struggling and making progress, the answer is “yes.”   Read 1,000 Little Things. “We don’t realize that, somewhere within us all, there does exist a supreme self who is eternally at peace.”?Elizabeth Gilbert Inner peace does not depend on external conditions; it’s what remains when you’ve surrendered your ego and your worries.  Peace can happen within you at any place and at any time.  It’s always there, patiently waiting for you to turn your attention toward it. Peace of mind arrives the moment you come to peace with what’s on your mind.  It happens when you let go of the need to be anywhere but where you are, physically and emotionally.  This acceptance of the way things are creates the foundation for inner harmony.  The need for something to be different in this moment is nothing more than a worry, and worries simply lead you in circles.  Acceptance will bring you back to your peaceful, productive center. Remember, the same part of you that longs for peace is the part of you that experiences peace.  It is not complicated to achieve and is as close as your next thought. “Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.”?Epicurus Don’t pray for the big things and forget to give thanks for the ordinary, simple, and yet not-so-small gifts in your life.  It may seem strange to feel thankful for those events in your life which appear to be ordinary, yet it’s precisely by being thankful that you can transform the ordinary into the extraordinary.  You may not see the value in spending time and effort acknowledging all the little, seemingly insignificant things in your life, yet without the little things there would be no big things. Don’t let what was once a miracle become common to you.  Don’t get so accustomed to life’s goodness that you overlook it.  Let your enthusiasm rise from the doldrums by being thankful for what you have.  Seize every opportunity to be appreciative.  Make genuine gratitude a constant companion to who you are, in all that you do.  Read Learned Optimism. “The only thing standing between you and your goal is the BS story you keep telling yourself as to why you can’t achieve it.”?Unknown  Instead of making a lot of excuses, make a little progress.  Instead of looking back with regret, step forward with enthusiasm.  Choose to view your life based on the best of what is possible.  Choose to define yourself based on the person you know you are capable of becoming.  If you believe it, you can do it. All the negativity from the past can be erased in the moment with a single positive action.  Go ahead and make it happen.  The best way to disconnect from a troubled past is to trust and connect with possibilities of the present moment.  When you embrace the power of now, the future belongs to you. “When you know better you do better.”?Maya Angelou Your education is the most powerful weapon you possess.  It has the power to change the world.  Keep it thriving.  Do not confuse your schooling with your education.  The classes at school end; your education is a continuous lifelong process. Keep your mind open to new ideas.  Challenge your beliefs when you’re given a chance.  The greatest advancements in your education will be based on your willingness to absorb fresh information without resistance and without losing your temper or your poise. “The scientist is not a person who gives the right answers, she’s the one who asks the right questions.”?Claude Lévi-Strauss There is profound power in asking questions.  In fact, the most successful people are rarely the ones who have all the answers, they’re the ones who ask the right questions.  Don’t be afraid to ask.  Ask when you don’t understand.  Ask for what you want.  Ask how to make things happen.  It’s the reason children are always asking so many questions, because they know they’ll never get anywhere if they don’t ask.  The squeaky wheel gets the grease. Bottom line:  Growth is more about asking than telling.  The way forward is yours for the taking – the way forward is yours for the asking.  Read Goals: How to Get Everything You Want. “In every end, there is also a beginning.”?Libba Bray Everything in life has to come to an end sometime.  It’s important to acknowledge and accept the end of an era – to walk away sensibly when something has reached its conclusion. Closing the door, turning the page, moving on, etc.  It doesn’t matter what you call it; what matters is that you leave the past where it belongs so you can enjoy the life that’s still available to be lived.  This ending is not THE END, it’s just your life beginning again in a new way.  It’s a point in your story where one chapter fades into the next.  Take a look at the first page of this new chapter; it’s a beautiful one.

May your life preach louder than your lips. May your success be your noise in the end. The result of enormous success is often pretty noisy — lots of people talking, writing, and sharing stories about it. The actual process of achieving enormous success, on the other hand, is far more discreet. But it’s this process that happens quietly, behind-the-scenes, that makes all the difference in the world. Marc and I are fortunate enough to know a number of enormously successful human beings. Regardless of lifestyle, industry or profession, they share many of the same quiet habits. And that’s precisely what I want to discuss with you today. Here are twelve key things the most successful people we know do quietly and diligently: [Read more…]  Let’s cut to the chase today. What you ultimately do in life comes out of who you believe you are. You have to practice believing in yourself and ignoring the naysayers. Because while you may not be able to control the impolite and unfair things some people say and do, you can press forward and decide not to be endlessly derailed by them. Of course, I know that’s all much easier said than done, but you must remind yourself that it can be done! How? Start by leveraging the right daily affirmations. After all, it’s not what others say about you, and it’s not what you broadcast to everyone else that determines the trajectory of your life. It’s what you whisper to yourself behind [Read more…]  You ultimately become what you repeatedly do. If your habits aren’t helping you, they’re hurting you. Here are some fairly common and widespread examples of the latter that will drain all your joy if you let them: Try to use frustration and inconvenience to motivate you rather than annoy you. You are in control of the way you look at life. Instead of getting angry, find the lesson. In place of envy, feel admiration. In place of worry, take action. In place of doubt, have faith. Remember that your response is always more powerful than your present circumstance. A small part of your life is decided by completely uncontrollable circumstances, while the vast majority of your life is decided by your responses. Where you ultimately end up is heavily dependent on [Read more…]  A good morning, and thus a good day, aren’t just experiences that magically happen — they are created consciously. Most of us are distracted from the get-go every morning. Trivial activities like checking social media, watching TV, and worrying about things we can’t control often set the tone of the day. And that means we waste our most well-rested time on things that don’t matter, while gradually losing touch with the significant, controllable parts of our lives that actually do matter. We simply forget that the morning hours are enormously important — they form the foundation from which the day is built. We forget that how we choose to spend these hours can be used to predict the kind of days we’re going to have, and ultimately the kind of lives we’re going to live. So if you feel like you’ve been getting a rough start lately, and stumbling through your days with diminished intention and focus, it’s time to consider [Read more…]  Perhaps it takes courage to raise children… Our youth can’t possibly know how age thinks and feels. And likewise, as we age we are often guilty of being so busy-brained that we forget what it was like to be young. Spending time with my young son helps me tap into my younger mind — he keeps me on my toes. For that I am grateful, but I still struggle as a parent. I struggle to be present. I struggle to be patient. I struggle to remember. Almost every single day. Truth be told, every parent battles with parenthood in their own way. Because parenting is not easy. What helps me is journaling about the lessons parenthood is gradually teaching me, and then referring back to what I’ve learned when I’m struggling and forgetful. Today, I want to share some quotes from my parenting journal with you. Perhaps they will assist you someday, the way they have assisted me again this morning… [Read more…] One Question that Will Save You from Failure|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/your-true-potential.jpg?resize=500%2C332&ssl=1| In the end, the questions you ask of yourselfdetermine the type of person you become. If you’re human, you’ve shared in the experience of seeking validation. It may be a simmering, subconscious compulsion – to get promoted, to get another degree, to lift a heavier weight or do a harder yoga pose – to be more, in some way, than you are now. Or maybe you’re on the front lines of your battle for self-worth, constantly questioning yourself.  “Do I have a right to her love?  Surely she’ll leave me.”  “Am I good enough to let my voice be heard at this meeting?  I’d better defer to my colleagues.” Whatever your striving for validation looks like, you are not alone.  Renowned social psychology researcher Albert Bandura showed that we’re constantly comparing ourselves against others and making decisions accordingly. This is a smart strategy from an evolutionary perspective – fitting in is a good way to survive. But we’re no longer trying simply to survive.  The luxury and curse of our era is that we can do virtually anything we want with our lives. And in this world of possibility, you are leaving your greatest potential unfulfilled by letting others define what success means for you. When I look around at my peers, I see brilliant people who are changing the world: doctors, lawyers, humanitarian sector workers, blossoming corporate champions, entrepreneurs, etc. My friends are awesome, but if I tried to define my own success by comparing myself to them, I’d feel terrible. I know this because I’ve done it. In my early 20s, I worried that I wasn’t good at picking up girls at the bar.  As foolish as that sounds, I kept trying because I saw friends do it and let it become a measure of my worth. More comparisons followed.  Could I hack it as a management consultant?  Could I get into a top business school?  These were self-imposed tests that I wasn’t even aware of while they were happening. I went through years of experimentation and self-doubt in order to cultivate the resolve that I now have about my path. I still find immense value in different perspectives and love to hear about the journeys my friends are on, but I also know that I have my own journey. The most important step for me was finally becoming aware that I was making comparisons, and deciding to create my own, different measures of success. Where in your life are you making these damaging comparisons? Many people achieve the outward trappings of success without ever reflecting on what really matters to them.  They are like racehorses with blinders on their eyes, galloping around a track, trying to “win.” Taking these blinders off can be bewildering.  If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by the totality of your free will, you have experienced this. Meet that bewildering freedom by asking yourself one fundamental question:  What does success mean to me? Have you ever honestly asked yourself this question?  Or have you simply adopted your priorities from everyone around you? Are you crystal clear on what success means for you? Here are a six ways you could measure success: Here are a six other ways you could measure success: The point is not that one measure of success is any better or worse than another. The point is that you get to choose how you define it for yourself. Simply recognize that the more conscious and deliberate you can be about what success means for YOU, the more empowered you will be to pursue the path that’s true for you. How do you define success?  What would make you successful in your own mind?  Leave a comment below and share your thoughts. Photo by: Christopher Mueller "
"25 Excuses You Must Drop to Be Happy|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/25-drop-excuses.jpg?resize=500%2C328&ssl=1| 8 Ways to Grow Your Happiness by Letting Go|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/8-happiness-letting-go.jpg?resize=500%2C296&ssl=1| Happiness in all walks of life is often more about stopping than starting.  More about subtracting than adding.  More about letting go than holding on. Consider, for example, what happens when you stop, subtract or let go of… Life isn’t perfect.  People make mistakes.  Let go of unfair expectations.  Stop criticizing yourself and others for being human.  If you feel like everyone is judging you all the time, realize that human beings often feel this way when they are too busy judging themselves. It’s far easier to be critical than correct, just as it’s easier to see why something is lacking rather than why it is good.  If you meet someone for the first time and you decide, “This is a person I don’t like,” you can basically take every one of their characteristics and find the obvious flaw.  What’s hard to do is describe what you like about them, despite their incompatibility with your ideals. Everyone is unique: not better, not worse, just unique in their own way.  Appreciate the differences instead of criticizing the shortcomings and you’ll see people – and yourself – in a far better light.  (Angel and I discuss this in detail in the Happiness and Relationships chapters of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Criticizing has a big brother: the know-it-all-syndrome.  The older you grow, the higher you rise in your chosen field, and the more you achieve, the more likely you are to think you know it all.  When you catch yourself thinking and speaking with intense finality and little tolerance for new ideas, stop yourself and take a deep breath.  If you do not, you will alienate the world around you and become more and more disconnected from reality with each passing day.  Few things are sadder and leave a person unhappier. Remember, it isn’t someone who proves you wrong that hurts you; it is choosing to continue your self-deception and ignorance that eventually conquers you entirely. The measure of your intelligence and success in life will be in direct proportion to your ability to change your mind and let it expand.  If someone is able to show you that what you think or do is not right, thank them and happily adjust.  Seek the truth.  Never stop learning. Craving control leads to anger and unhappiness.  Life is to be lived, not controlled.  Powerful, positive change will occur in your life when you decide to take control of yourself instead of craving control over everyone and everything else. Imagine that you’re driving in your car and you get stuck in rush hour traffic.  The traffic situation is out of your control and simply requires your patience.  However, this doesn’t stop you from switching lanes, trying to cut in front of other cars, or even leaving the road you’re on to try alternate routes – all desperate efforts to gain control.  Sadly, these efforts just lead to further stress and unhappiness when they are unsuccessful – when control is again obstructed. Quite simply, the reason you are often miserable and stressed is because of an unhealthy attachment to certain things you have no control over.  So let go.  Release the tension and stress.  Realize you haven’t lost anything; you were never in control of the uncontrollable to begin with.  (Read The Power of Now.) When something negative happens, view this circumstance as a chance to learn something you didn’t know.  Don’t wish it never happened.  Don’t try to step back in time.  Take the lessons learned and step forward.  You have to tell yourself, “It’s OK. You’re doing OK.”  You need to know that it’s better to cross new lines and suffer the consequences of a lesson learned from time to time, than to just stare at the lines for the rest of your life and always wonder. The past is valuable.  It provides a solid foundation for everything you’re doing now.  Learn from it – the mistakes and the successes – and then let it go.  This process might seem easier said than done, but it depends on your focus.  The past is just training; it doesn’t define you in this moment.  Think about what went wrong, but only in terms of how you will help you make things right. The bottom line is that if nothing ever changed – if no chances were ever taken and no mistakes were ever made – there would be no sunrise the next morning.  Most of us are comfortable where we are even though the whole universe is constantly changing around us.  Learning to accept this change is vital to our happiness and general self-improvement.  Because only when we let go of what used to be, do we grow and begin to see a world we never knew was possible. Life is NOT short if you spend every waking moment appreciating it.  It’s just that by the time most of us catch up to appreciating what we have, we’ve already squandered our time and left life at least halfway behind us. The key is being thankful for what you have NOW. No, not all the puzzle pieces of life will seem to fit together at first, but in time you’ll realize they do, perfectly.  So thank the situations that didn’t work out for you, because they just made room for the situations that will.  And thank the people who walked away from you, because they just made room for the ones who won’t. No matter how good or bad you think you have it, wake up each day thankful for your life.  Someone somewhere else is desperately fighting for theirs.  Instead of thinking about what you’re missing, think about what you have that everyone else is missing.  Think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive in your own shoes – to breathe a fresh breath, to think another thought, to enjoy a new moment, to have options – then go out and make the day count. Complaining does not work as a strategy.  Those who complain the most, accomplish the least positive results.  When you spend time fretting and complaining, you’re simply using your imagination to create things you don’t want. Don’t talk about what’s wrong.  Harping on your problems makes you feel worse, not better.  Unless you want to complain about it forever, eventually you’ll have to DO something.  If you took a fraction of the energy you put into complaining and applied it to solving your problem, you’d likely be stunned by how well things can work out.  Start talking about how you’ll improve things, even if the conversation is only with yourself, and then focus on the next positive step.  Refocus your energy into making your situation better.  (Read The Power of Habit.) Sometimes we’re afraid we’ll fail.  Sometimes we’re subconsciously afraid we’ll succeed, because then we’d have to deal with all the disruption (growth) and change that follows success.  And other times it’s our fear of rejection or simply our fear of looking like a fool.  So it’s easier to hesitate, to wait for the perfect moment, to decide we need to think a bit longer or do some more research or explore a few more unnecessary alternatives. Meanwhile days, weeks, months, and even years of our precious lives pass us by.  And so do our dreams. The best way I’ve found to let go of fear is to stare it down.  Connect to your fear, feel it in your body, realize it and steadily address it.  Greet it by name if you have to: “Welcome, fear.”  And then take action!  Whatever you’ve been planning, whatever you’ve imagined, whatever you’ve dreamed of, don’t wait another minute.  Get started!  Take the first step.  Do something.  Do anything.  Learn as you go and watch as your fears slowly subside. It’s not always where you are in life, but who you have by your side that matters most.  Some people drain you and others provide soul food.  Don’t jeopardize your dignity and self-respect by trying to make someone accept, love and appreciate you when they have proven that they are incapable of doing so. When you leave the wrong people behind, the right things start happening.  What would happen if you surrounded yourself with people who made you better?  What would happen if you started spending time with the RIGHT people? Think about it. What could you stop, subtract, or let go in life that would make you feel happier and more at ease?  Please leave us a comment below and let us know.

The quality of the happiness between two people grows in direct proportion to their acceptance, and in inverse proportion to their intolerance and expectations.  True friends love and appreciate each other just the way they are. True friendship and good character is all about how a person nurtures another person when they are vulnerable and can give very little in return.  Thus, it’s not who’s standing beside you during good times, but the ones who stick by you through tough times that are your true friends. So take note of who remains in your life when times get tough, especially the people who sacrifice the resources they have in their life to help you improve yours when you need it most.  Seriously, when you come out the other side of a difficult period in your life, look around you.  The people still standing beside you are your true friends. Unfortunately, some who seem like your friends will try to hold you back from your full potential.  It may be difficult, but don’t let these negative imposters bring you down.  Don’t ever let your so-called friends turn your sky into a ceiling.  Beware of friends who try to belittle your ambitions.  Small hearts and minds always do that.  The greatest hearts and minds – the people you should spend time around – make you feel that you, too, can become great. Remember, encouraging things happen when you distance yourself from discouraging people.  Doing so doesn’t mean you hate them, it simply means you respect yourself.  (Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the “Relationships” chapter of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Some people will refuse to accept that you are no longer who you used to be – that you’ve made mistakes in the past, learned from them, and moved beyond them.  They may not be able to stand the fact that you’re growing and moving on with your life, and so they will try to drag your past to catch up with you.  Do not help them by acknowledging their begrudging behavior.  Let go of their negativity, find peace, and liberate yourself! A true friend never holds the unchangeable past against you; instead, they help your repair your present and future.  If someone relentlessly judges you by your past and holds it against you, you might have to take matters into your own hands, and repair your present and future by leaving them behind. When you keep someone in your life who is a chronic liar, and you keep giving them new chances to be trusted, you have a lot in common with this person – you’re both lying and being unfriendly to YOU. If you know someone who avoids the truth by telling you only what you want to hear, they do so for their own benefit, not yours.  They are not a true friend and they don’t deserve to be treated as such. If you think about the people who have had the greatest positive effect on your life – the ones who truly made a difference – you will likely realize that they aren’t the ones that tried to give you all the answers or solve all your problems.  They’re the ones who sat silently with you when you needed a moment to think, who lent you a shoulder when you needed to cry, and who tolerated not having all the answers, but stood beside you anyway. Don’t look for a friend who will solve all your problems; look for one who will face them with you.  (Read Tuesdays with Morrie.) You deserve to be with friends who make you smile – friends who don’t take you for granted – friends who won’t leave you hanging.  When you notice that a friend is always taking from you without giving back, you might need to distance yourself from them for a while.  If they care, they’ll notice.  If they don’t, you know where you stand. You should want to give, but you shouldn’t be forced to always give more than you get.  If you feel like you are being taken advantage of, respect yourself enough to confront the situation.  This doesn’t mean you have to stop being friends with those who you feel are at fault, but you need to evaluate your friendships and realize where to draw the line when you give yourself to certain people. It takes a great deal of courage to stand up to your enemies, but just as much to stand up to your friends.  Sometimes bullying comes from the most unlikely places.  Be cognizant of how your friends treat you, and look out for the subtle jabs they throw.  When necessary, confront them or distance yourself from them – whatever it takes to give yourself the opportunity to grow into who you really are. Life’s too short to be hanging around people who try to control and manipulate you.  Anyone who does so is not a true friend.  Gain your independence by taking off the shackles and freeing yourself from these bullies.  (Read The Mastery of Love.) True friendship is never burdened with stressful promises and obligations.  What true friends do for each other should be done because they care and because they want to do them.  Period. So don’t chase people.  They don’t need to be chased.  If someone is a true friend and wants you in their life, they’ll make room for you.  You shouldn’t have to fight for a spot.  Never, ever force yourself on someone who continuously overlooks your worth. A true friend who understands your tears and troubles is far more valuable than a hundred friends who only show up for your smiles and joys.  Because a true friend accepts who you truly are, and also helps you become who you are capable of being. Friendships like this require more than just finding the right person, they also require you to be the right person.  When someone believes in you enough to lift you up, try not to let them down.  True friendship is a sweet responsibility to be nurtured, not an opportunity to be exploited. What would you add to the list?  What’s one thing a true friend would never do?  Leave a comment below and let us know. Photo by: JDConway "
"9 Lies to Unlearn Before it’s Too Late|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/9-lies-to-unlearn.jpg?resize=500%2C332&ssl=1| The worst lies are the ones you tell yourself over and over again – the ones you live by.  Perhaps someone close to you ingrained these lies in your mind, perhaps you were influenced by the negativity of popular media channels, or perhaps they grew from simple, innocent misunderstandings. Either way, next time you decide to learn something new for the sake of self-improvement, start by unlearning a lie that has been deceiving you.  Here are nine lies I have unlearned in my own life: There are two ways people try to find happiness.  One is to continue to accumulate more and more of what they think they want.  The other is to appreciate what they already have.  The latter is the right path.  Happiness isn’t about getting what you want; it’s about wanting what you’ve got.  Happiness is not a goal, it’s a by-product of living well in each moment. To be happy doesn’t mean you don’t desire more, it simply means you’re thankful for what you have and patient for what’s yet to come.  Sometimes it’s easy to get so caught up in trying to accomplish something big, that you fail to notice the little things that give life its magic.  So appreciate today for all it’s worth.  Today is one of the good old days you’re going to miss in the years ahead. You are not in this world to live up to everyone else’s expectations, nor should you feel that everyone else is here to live up to yours.  You’ve got to pave your own distinct path.  What success means to each of us is different.  It’s about spending your life happily in your own way. You have your own personal calling that’s as unique as your fingerprints.  The best way to succeed is to discover this calling within you and then find a way to offer it to the world in the form of a beneficial service.  Ultimately, if you can wake up every morning and do something that makes a positive difference, makes you proud, and makes you smile, before you get back to bed, you are a true success.  (Angel and I discuss this process in the Success and Passion chapters of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) “Work smarter, not harder” is one of the most common clichés in the personal development space.  But like most clichés, few people actually do it.  Go ahead and take a look around; the busy people outnumber the productive people by a wide margin.  Perhaps you’re one of them. Busyness seems impressive.  It puts you in the heat of the action.  It gives you an elevated sense of accomplishment.  You’re always late for social engagements, barely have enough time for family get-togethers, and hardly get a moment to yourself.  Emails and texts are shooting out of your smartphone like machinegun bullets, commitments and meetings fill up your entire calendar, and sleep is an afterthought.  You’re like a rock star without a record. Of course, it’s all just an illusion.  A commitment to anything more than the essential is to work harder, not smarter.  So flip it around and work smarter by putting first things first. Truth be told, the only time you can be brave is when you are afraid. Being brave is when you do something, regardless of your fears, because you know it’s the right thing to do.  In other words, you are afraid to do it because there are unknowns, but then you go ahead and do it anyway. Whatever course you decide upon in life, there is always the possibility that something will go wrong.  There will always be difficulties arising that tempt you to fear that you don’t have what it takes.  To map out any course of action and follow it to an end requires bravery.  (Read Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway.) Life is often painful.  It requires a worthy struggle for growth and experience.  Anyone who says differently is selling a lie. The strongest people are the ones who feel pain, accept it, learn from it, and fight through it.  They turn their wounds into wisdom.  It’s all about having the courage to take a break, to shed a tear, to dust yourself off, and then to get back in the ring to fight like you’ve never fought before. Many of us don’t genuinely want to be responsible for our own fate.  Perhaps we daydream about “fulfilling our dreams,” but we leave those dreams firmly in the realm of fantasy.  We don’t research them, talk to people about them, read related books, etc.  Somehow we prefer the fantasy to the reality.  And there’s nothing wrong with that, until we say that someone else is “holding us back”.  That turns an idle fantasy into a barricade of lies. The truth is, if you’re not working on something meaningful today, the only person holding you back is YOU.  If you aren’t doing anything about your goals and dreams, you have no one to blame except yourself.  Either you take responsibility for your life or someone else will.  Blame is a scapegoat – it’s an easy way out of taking accountability for your own outcome.  It’s a lot easier to point the finger at someone or something else instead of looking within. When it comes to working hard to achieve a goal or dream – earning a degree, building a business, or any other personal achievement that takes time and commitment – one thing you have to ask yourself is:  “Am I willing to live a few years of my life like many people won’t, so I can spend the rest of my life like many people can’t?” People are sometimes led to have a sense of entitlement because they falsely believe they are owed something based on the social role they have chosen.  For example, if someone has accepted the role of being someone’s friend, boyfriend, girlfriend, husband or wife, they feel entitled to get certain favors from the other person.  If someone has accepted the role of being a parent, they feel entitled to being respected by their children.  If someone has accepted the role of being a consumer, they feel entitled to be served to their specific wishes. Of course, these expectations of entitlement often go unfulfilled.  Why?  Because nothing in this world is promised.  Regardless of your chosen role in all your relationships and walks of life, you don’t automatically get any more than you openly communicate, negotiate, and work for.  (Read The Road Less Traveled.) So many of us complain about the boring repetition present in our daily routines, yet we choose no clear course for correction.  We want to change something, but we never think the time is right.  Why?  Because the very source of our boredom also provides a solid foundation of comfort.  We are comfortable with our current surroundings.  Steering off the known track is risky, and we are subconsciously scared of what might happen if we do. So, what happens when we stick to the current track?  Nothing.  We jog along the same circular track at a steady pace daily.  We pass by the same mile marker at the exact moment we did yesterday, and the day before, and the week before that.  There is not a worry on our minds because we already know the terrain that lies ahead. If something makes you a bit nervous and uncomfortable, it means you’re doing it right and growing.  All great opportunities in life will force you to grow emotionally and intellectually.  They force you to stretch yourself and your comfort zone, which means you won’t feel totally comfortable at first.  And when you don’t feel comfortable, you will likely assume the timing isn’t right, even though it is. Nothing is too late until your tired heart stops beating. If you’re reading this right now, congratulations, you are alive, which means it’s not too late for you. Things can change if you want them to, at any age.  Right now you can choose differently and make something new happen.  Your future is immediate.  Grab on to it with both hands and keep on moving on.  When you come up on a roadblock and are faced with the choice of sitting down and doing nothing or doing something to make further progress, choose the latter.  Think, work, and climb if you have to. Move your life forward. What self-defeating lies do people often tell themselves?  What’s one self-defeating lie you once believed was true?  Share your thoughts with us by leaving a comment below.

All relationships require work.  They don’t just materialize and maintain themselves, and they aren’t built on a foundation of convenience either.  They take time and patience and two people who are willing to put in the effort. Here’s how to do your part – nine things your relationships need from you: Neglect based on lack of attention damages relationships far more often than malicious abuse.  There’s nothing more vital to the bond you share with others than simply being there for them. When we pay attention to each other we breathe new life into each other.  With frequent attention and affection our relationships flourish, and we as individuals grow stronger.  This is the side effect of a good relationship – we help heal each other’s wounds and support each other’s strengths. Bottom line:  Stay in close touch with those who matter to you – communicate openly on a regular basis.  Not because it’s convenient, but because these people are worth the extra effort. The entire fabric of our society – people working, living and breathing together – relies on the positive beliefs we have about each other – a subtle, inherent trust.  This trust is the glue that holds every peaceful civilization together.  Which is why trust is the greatest compliment you can give a person, even greater than love. The only way to build this trust, or find out if someone is trustworthy, is to trust them.  When you do, without a doubt, you’ll automatically get one of two results:  A friend for life or a lesson for life.  Either way the outcome is positive – you determine which relationships are worth your long-term attention.  Read The SPEED of Trust. When your intentions are good and your cause is just, honesty will always help you.  When your heart is open to love and truth, your lips will not utter lies that haunt you.  When people are honest with each other up front, the truth may hurt sooner, but the suffering always dies faster, and out of this suffering comes growth. Be honest about what’s right, as well as what needs to be changed.  Be honest about what you want in a relationship and how you want to be treated.  Be honest with every aspect of your relationships, always. The bottom line is that relationships don’t hurt.  Lying, cheating and twisting reality until it screws with someone’s emotions is what hurts.  Never mess with someone’s feelings just because you’re unsure of your own.  If you are unsure in any way, be sure to say so.  Always be open and honest. Stand by those you care about in their darkest moments, not because you want to stand in the dark, but because you don’t want them to either.  Brave the shadows alongside them until they’re able to find the light.  On the flipside, stand by these same people on their sunniest days, not because you want to scorch your skin, but because you’re not afraid to let them shine bright. In other words, be loyal.  You can’t promise to be there for someone for the rest of their life, but you can sincerely be there for them for the rest of yours.  When it comes to relationships, remaining faithful is never an option, but a priority.  Loyalty means the world. The most important trip you will ever take in life is meeting others half way.  You will achieve far more by working with people, rather than working alone or against them. That’s what healthy relationships are all about – teamwork.  The strength of every relationship depends on the strength of its members, and the strength of each member depends on the quality of their relationships. Anyone who helps you to make your half-hearted attempts more whole-hearted through passion, love and teamwork, is a precious friend and teacher.  They are part of your dream team.  These people are out there.  Connect with them and conquer the world together.  Read Tribes. There’s no such thing as a perfect relationship.  Even if it seems perfect now, it won’t always be.  Imperfection, however, is real and beautiful.  It’s how two people accept and deal with the imperfections of a relationship that make it ideal. The quality of the happiness between two people grows in direct proportion to their acceptance, and in inverse proportion to their intolerance and expectations.  They must appreciate their similarities and respect their differences. Forgiveness is one of the greatest virtues to which you should always seek.  Imagine if everyone you knew was willing both to apologize and to accept an apology.  Is there any problem that you all would not be able to solve? The willingness to admit that we are all human, and to forgive sincerely, is a sign of your emotional strength and maturity.  Ultimately, this forgiveness is for you.  It sets you free from the shackles of the past so you can take the future in stride, regardless of whether you choose to bring certain people along for the ride. Forgiveness is not saying, “What you did is OK.”  It is saying, “I’m not going to let what you did ruin my happiness forever.” Forgiveness is YOUR remedy. Sometimes we feel as though the world is crashing down around us, as if the pain we are experiencing is unique only to us in this moment.  This, of course, is far from the truth.  In fact, the very demons that torment each of us torment others all over the world.  It is our challenges and pain that connect us at the deepest level.  We are all in this together and we should treat each other as such. If you think about the people who have had the greatest positive effect on your life – the ones who truly made a difference – you will likely realize that they aren’t the ones that tried to give you all the answers or solve all your problems.  They’re the ones who sat silently with you when you needed a moment to think, who lent you a shoulder when you needed to cry, and who tolerated not having all the answers, but stood beside you anyway.  Be this person for the people you care about. Relationships don’t create joy, they reflect it.  Joy comes from within.  Relationships are simply mirrors of the combined joy that two people have as individuals.  What you see in the mirror is what you see in your relationships.  Your disappointment in others perfectly reflects your disappointment in yourself.  Your acceptance of others perfectly reflects your acceptance of yourself.  Thus, the first step to having healthy relationship with anyone else is to have a healthy relationship with yourself. You are powerful and beautiful when you love yourself.  So get up, look in the mirror and say, “I love you, and I mean it!” Also, respect yourself enough to never feel guilty about removing toxic people from your life.  It doesn’t matter whether these people are relatives, romantic interests, coworkers, old friends, or new acquaintances – you don’t have to make room in your life for people who make you feel like you’re less than you are.  Read 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.

People’s lives become happier the minute they decide to be. Be the latter.  For fast-acting stress relief, slow down and consider the following: Lack of direction creates stress.  And it’s lack of direction, not lack of time, that’s the problem when it comes to personal achievement.  Everyone has the same 24-hour days and 7-day weeks. Whenever you want to achieve something keep your conscious clear.  Focus and make sure you know exactly what it is you want and why.  No one can hit their target if they don’t know what their target is. The essence of personal productivity is to do the important things rather than the urgent things. In other words, put first things first.  Focus on the essential and eliminate the rest.  (Marc and I discuss this in detail in the Simplicity and Productivity chapters of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) Don’t worry about perfection; you’ll never achieve it.  Instead, focus on the progress you’ve made and the progress you intend to make today. Progression is not automatic or inevitable.  Every step of personal growth requires sacrifice and work.  Every step is part of an ever-improving, ever-ascending life path.  Every step is an accomplishment that should be celebrated.  You know you will never get to the absolute peak (perfection), but when you celebrate the journey this truth only adds to the joy and glory of the climb. Just as your body needs regular washing because it gets dirty every day, so does your heart. Because every day, people hurt you, offend you, forget you, snub you, step on you, or reject you.  But if you choose to forgive these people and let these things go at the end of each day, you cleanse your heart.  You wake up the next morning refreshed and free of negativity.  Refuse to carry old regrets, mindsets, and distractions into each new day.  Read The Happiness Project. You must learn a new way to think before you can master a new way to be. Behind every stressful feeling is an untrue thought.  Before the thought you weren’t suffering, but after the thought you began to suffer.  When you recognize that the thought isn’t true, once again there is no suffering.  When you change your thoughts, you change your life. The most important journeys that lead to the most wonderful places are usually the challenging ones you must endure the hard way. Stress is but a wall between two peaceful gardens – the garden where you are and garden where you want to be.  You must scale the wall that’s in your way, gathering lessons as you climb, before letting go as you descend to the other side.  You will only lose if you never climb or you never let go. A good workout is the best stress reducer, and a fit, healthy body is the best fashion statement. The pursuit of optimal fitness is a journey, a constant struggle, a lifestyle.  It’s a gradual process where intensity during each exercise session, what you eat every single day, and patience over years is what’s required. But as you know, the longest journey always begins with a single step.  It’s all about taking that step and then stepping one day at a time, committing yourself to a daily intake of 30 to 60 minutes of uninterrupted exercise and a reasonably healthy diet.  Read Eat to Live. Put yourself at the top of your priority list.  There is no person on Earth who deserves your kindness and attention more than you.  When you love yourself first, everything else falls into place. So treat yourself every day.  Give yourself something special – like laughter, good conversation, meditation, quiet reading, an hour to work on a passion, a long walk, etc. You are worth it. Organize, don’t agonize.  Keep your space ordered and your schedule under-booked.  Create a foundation with a soft place to land, a wide margin of error, and room to think and breathe… So you have the flexibility to explore the possibilities for happiness in each and every day. What would you add to the list?  What do you do to make yourself smile when life gets stressful?  Please leave a comment below.

Rowling Let me distract you for a moment and tell you four short stories. These are old stories – familiar stories.  The people and the circumstances differ slightly for everyone who tells them, but the core lessons remain the same. I hope the twist we’ve put on them here inspires you to think differently… Every Sunday morning I take a light jog around a park near my home.  There’s a lake located in one corner of the park.  Each time I jog by this lake, I see the same elderly woman sitting at the water’s edge with a small metal cage sitting beside her. This past Sunday my curiosity got the best of me, so I stopped jogging and walked over to her.  As I got closer, I realized that the metal cage was in fact a small trap.  There were three turtles, unharmed, slowly walking around the base of the trap.  She had a fourth turtle in her lap that she was carefully scrubbing with a spongy brush. “Hello,” I said.  “I see you here every Sunday morning.  If you don’t mind my nosiness, I’d love to know what you’re doing with these turtles.” She smiled.  “I’m cleaning off their shells,” she replied.  “Anything on a turtle’s shell, like algae or scum, reduces the turtle’s ability to absorb heat and impedes its ability to swim.  It can also corrode and weaken the shell over time.” “Wow!  That’s really nice of you!” I exclaimed. She went on: “I spend a couple of hours each Sunday morning, relaxing by this lake and helping these little guys out.  It’s my own strange way of making a difference.” “But don’t most freshwater turtles live their whole lives with algae and scum hanging from their shells?” I asked. “Yep, sadly, they do,” she replied. I scratched my head.  “Well then, don’t you think your time could be better spent?  I mean, I think your efforts are kind and all, but there are fresh water turtles living in lakes all around the world.  And 99% of these turtles don’t have kind people like you to help them clean off their shells.  So, no offense… but how exactly are your localized efforts here truly making a difference?” The woman giggled aloud.  She then looked down at the turtle in her lap, scrubbed off the last piece of algae from its shell, and said, “Sweetie, if this little guy could talk, he’d tell you I just made all the difference in the world.” The moral:  You can change the world – maybe not all at once, but one person, one animal, and one good deed at a time.  Wake up every morning and pretend like what you do makes a difference.  It does.  (Read 29 Gifts.) Once upon a time a psychology professor walked around on a stage while teaching stress management principles to an auditorium filled with students.  As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they’d be asked the typical “glass half empty or glass half full” question.  Instead, with a smile on her face, the professor asked, “How heavy is this glass of water I’m holding?” Students shouted out answers ranging from eight ounces to a couple pounds. She replied, “From my perspective, the absolute weight of this glass doesn’t matter.  It all depends on how long I hold it.  If I hold it for a minute or two, it’s fairly light.  If I hold it for an hour straight, its weight might make my arm ache a little.  If I hold it for a day straight, my arm will likely cramp up and feel completely numb and paralyzed, forcing me to drop the glass to the floor.  In each case, the weight of the glass doesn’t change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it feels to me.” As the class shook their heads in agreement, she continued, “Your stresses and worries in life are very much like this glass of water.  Think about them for a while and nothing happens.  Think about them a bit longer and you begin to ache a little.  Think about them all day long, and you will feel completely numb and paralyzed – incapable of doing anything else until you drop them.” The moral:  It’s important to remember to let go of your stresses and worries.  No matter what happens during the day, as early in the evening as you can, put all your burdens down.  Don’t carry them through the night and into the next day with you.  If you still feel the weight of yesterday’s stress, it’s a strong sign that it’s time to put the glass down.  (Angel and I discuss this process of letting go in the Adversity and Self-Love chapters of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) During a research experiment a marine biologist placed a shark into a large holding tank and then released several small bait fish into the tank. As you would expect, the shark quickly swam around the tank, attacked and ate the smaller fish. The marine biologist then inserted a strong piece of clear fiberglass into the tank, creating two separate partitions. She then put the shark on one side of the fiberglass and a new set of bait fish on the other. Again, the shark quickly attacked.  This time, however, the shark slammed into the fiberglass divider and bounced off.  Undeterred, the shark kept repeating this behavior every few minutes to no avail.  Meanwhile, the bait fish swam around unharmed in the second partition.  Eventually, about an hour into the experiment, the shark gave up. This experiment was repeated several dozen times over the next few weeks.  Each time, the shark got less aggressive and made fewer attempts to attack the bait fish, until eventually the shark got tired of hitting the fiberglass divider and simply stopped attacking altogether. The marine biologist then removed the fiberglass divider, but the shark didn’t attack.  The shark was trained to believe a barrier existed between it and the bait fish, so the bait fish swam wherever they wished, free from harm. The moral:  Many of us, after experiencing setbacks and failures, emotionally give up and stop trying. Like the shark in the story, we believe that because we were unsuccessful in the past, we will always be unsuccessful. In other words, we continue to see a barrier in our heads, even when no ‘real’ barrier exists between where we are and where we want to go.  (Read The Road Less Traveled.) One warm evening many years ago… After spending nearly every waking minute with Angel for eight straight days, I knew that I had to tell her just one thing.  So late at night, just before she fell asleep, I whispered it in her ear.  She smiled – the kind of smile that makes me smile back –and she said, “When I’m seventy-five and I think about my life and what it was like to be young, I hope that I can remember this very moment.” A few seconds later she closed her eyes and fell asleep.  The room was peaceful – almost silent.  All I could hear was the soft purr of her breathing.  I stayed awake thinking about the time we’d spent together and all the choices in our lives that made this moment possible.  And at some point, I realized that it didn’t matter what we’d done or where we’d gone.  Nor did the future hold any significance. All that mattered was the serenity of the moment. Just being with her and breathing with her. The moral:  We must not allow the clock, the calendar, and external pressures to rule our lives and blind us to the fact that each individual moment of our lives is a beautiful mystery and a miracle – especially those moments we spend in the presence of a loved one.

"6 Questions You Need To Stop Asking Yourself|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/6-question-stop-asking.jpg?resize=500%2C334&ssl=1| You are powerful when you believe in yourself – when you know that you are capable of anything you put your mind to.  You are beautiful when your strength and determination shines as you follow your own path – when you aren’t disheveled by the obstacles along the way.  You are unstoppable when you let your mistakes educate you, as your confidence builds from experiences – when you know you can fall down, pick yourself up, and move forward. Here are 11 ways to become the person you love. In the end, loving yourself is about enjoying your life, trusting your own feelings, taking chances, losing and finding happiness, cherishing the memories, and learning from the past.  Sometimes you have to stop worrying, wondering, and doubting.  Have faith that things will work out, maybe not exactly how you planned, but just how it’s meant to be. Photo by: Juliana Coutinho 5 Things YOU Should Be an Expert At|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/5-how-to-live.jpg?resize=500%2C413&ssl=1|Click or tap on a book to check it out:     Sometimes it’s excruciatingly hard to get back up again.  This is how Marc and I felt just over a decade ago when we were knocked down and stuck in a rut after simultaneously losing two loved ones to suicide and illness.  It was nearly impossible to move when we didn’t feel we had the strength to push forward. But, we found a way. We pushed ourselves as hard as we could to take one tiny step every day—one journal entry, one 10-minute workout, one honest conversation, and so forth.  It wasn’t easy, but the tiny steps were manageable and we gradually grew stronger.  And believe it or not, that’s basically what I did again this morning.  I was desperately struggling to motivate myself for the past few days after a significant business opportunity fell through.  I was feeling utterly defeated.  So, I took the tiniest possible step.  Just turning on my laptop, opening up the word processing application, and writing a single sentence.  Such an action is so small as to seem insignificant, and yet so easy as to be possible when I was feeling desperate and defeated again this morning.  And it showed me that the next step was possible, and the next.  And the end result is the couple paragraphs you’ve just finished reading. Why am I telling you this? Because I know we all need a healthy reminder sometimes… to do the hard things we need to do to be happy.  The things that frighten us.  The things others can’t do for us.  The things that make the difference between existing and living—between knowing the path and walking the path—between a life of empty promises and defeat and one filled with renewed happiness, possibility and peace. And, along these lines, I have some great news: Marc and I wrote three bestselling books (one of them is a New York Times bestseller) to guide us—all of us—through that necessary journey of doing the hard things.  I sincerely wish I could have read these books over a decade ago.  In many ways, it would have saved me from myself.  It absolutely would have saved me from intense periods of darkness that were born primarily from my subconscious attempt to take the easy way out of the painful realities I faced. Watch what happened when Marc and I stepped into the Today Show studio recently to discuss the painful personal journey that inspired us to write…  The books are available to order together right now.  If you decide to order today, send me an email at [email protected] with your receipt information (just copy and paste or screenshot the finalized order details from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Audible, or wherever you choose to order the book.).  We’ve prepared a great digital bonus for you: a 30-point “daily reminders” book (I guarantee you’ll find immense value in this bonus). Also, watch the official Getting Back to Happy book trailer:  And yes, the new book shares the title of our renowned Getting Back to Happy course, but understandably, the book and the course are completely different educational tools. For example, our course is video based, includes live one-on-one Skype/FaceTime coaching with Marc and me, and has an active online support community. The Getting Back to Happy book is a smaller, self-paced resource you can hold in your hands and take with you wherever you go… something you can turn to in real time, offline, as you need it. Both tools—the course and the book—complement each other very well, but they are standalone. In the book, you will face the truth right from the get-go… You are not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or a week ago.  You are always growing.  Experiences don’t stop.  That’s life.  And the very experiences that seem so tough when you are going through them are the ones you will look back on with gratitude for how far you have come.  Of course, it takes practice to get there, emotionally and physically, and that’s why we wrote this for YOU. The goal of the book is not to get rid of all your negative thoughts, feelings and life situations.  That is impossible.  The goal is to change your response to them. Again, Getting Back to Happy is the book I wish Marc and I had when life’s biggest challenges came our way.  Filled with actionable steps for bouncing back from tough times and getting back on the road to happiness and success, this is a book to spark sustainable action—and to return to whenever needed.  Sharing never-before-published stories and strategies, the book shows how to harness the power of daily rituals, mindfulness, self-care, and more to shift our perspective—and our actions—in order to become our happiest and most effective selves. Order Getting Back to Happy: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Reality, and Turn Your Trials into Triumphs today (and don’t forget to email me your receipt details, so we can send you the bonus books once they’re ready).

Check out over 180 published articles in the archives! 7 Behaviors to Stop Tolerating from Others|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-behaviors-tolerating.jpg?resize=500%2C500&ssl=1| It is better to be alone than in bad company. Your dignity may be attacked, ravaged and disgracefully mocked, but it can never be taken away unless you willingly surrender it.  It’s all about finding the strength to defend your boundaries. The manipulators of the world will test you from time to time to see if you bend.  Don’t let them intimidate you.  When you catch them pushing on you, push back.  All it takes is once, and if they get away with pushing you around that once – if they know they can treat you like that – then it sets the pattern for the future. You are stronger than them!  Stick up for yourself and stop tolerating… Bullying is not OK.  Period.  There is no freedom on Earth that gives someone the right to assault who you are as a person.  Sadly, some people just won’t be happy until they’ve pushed your ego to the ground and stomped on it.  What you have to do is have the nerve to stand your ground.  Don’t give them any leeway.  Nobody has the power to make you feel small unless you give them that power. It takes a great deal of courage to stand up to your enemies, but just as much to stand up to your family and friends.  Sometimes bullying comes from the most unlikely places.  Be cognizant of how the people closest to you treat you, and look out for the subtle jabs they throw.  When necessary, confront them – whatever it takes to give yourself the opportunity to grow into who you really are.  (Angel and I cover this in detail in the Adversity and Relationships chapters of 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently.) If you have survived the wrath of a physical abuser, and you tried to reconcile things… If you forgave, and you struggled, and even if the expression of your grief had you succumb to outbursts of anger… If you spent years hanging on to the notions of trust and faith, even after you knew in your heart that those beautiful intangibles, upon which love is built and sustained, would never be returned… And especially, if you stood up as the barrier between an abuser and someone else, and took the brunt of the abuse in their place… You are a HERO. But now it’s time to be the hero of your future.  Enough is enough! As Gandhi once said, “An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.” Regardless of how despicable another has acted, never let hate build in your heart.  Fighting hatred with hatred only hurts you more.  When you decide to hate someone you automatically begin digging two graves: one for your enemy and one for yourself. Hateful grudges are for those who insist that they are owed something.  Forgiveness, on the other hand, is for those who are strong enough and smart enough to move on.  After all, the best revenge is to be unlike the person who hurt you.  The best revenge is living well, in a way that creates peace in your heart.  (Read Buddha’s Brain.) There are plenty of people in this world who will be generous when sharing their negativity and ignorance.  And while they may seem quite eager to feed you their rubbish, please remember it’s not the diet you need.  You need positivity.  So be cautious with whom you let feed your mind and soul.  Do not let the negative opinions of others destroy your inner spirit. Throughout your life you will meet two kinds of people: those who are a drain on your energy and dreams, and those who give you the energy to pursue your dreams.  Avoid the first kind and cherish the second. If someone fools you once, shame on them.  If someone fools you twice, shame on you. If you catch someone lying to you, speak up.  Some people will lie to you repeatedly in a vicious effort to get you to repeat their lies over and over until they effectively become true.  Don’t partake in their nonsense.  Don’t let their lies be your reality. Remember, an honest adversary is always better than a friend who lies.  Pay less attention to what people say, and more attention to what they do.  Their actions will show you the truth.  (Read In Sheep’s Clothing.) Never let someone’s opinion of you wash away your truth.  Never sacrifice who you are or what you aspire to be because someone else sees things differently. Sometimes even your closest confidants will carelessly crush your potential with smiles on their faces.  They will discredit your ideas, exhibiting zero emotional support, and inadvertently persuade you to forget part of the person you are, along with the person you are capable of becoming. Don’t let weak minds convince you that you aren’t strong enough.  You are. When you feel out of control or a little lost it can be tempting to look for someone willing to take charge of your life for you, just to alleviate the pressure.  But before you do consider this: if you put a collar around your own neck and hand the leash to someone else, you’ll have no say about where they lead you in life. When it comes to exercising your inner genius, you must listen to your inner voice.  Try what you want to try, go where you want to go and explore the depths of your own intuition.  Don’t accept false choices just because someone else doesn’t feel what you feel.  Don’t let others leash your dreams and your future.  If something feels right, it probably is.  Give yourself the fair chance you deserve. This is your life.  You may not be able to control all the things people do to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.  You can decide not to let their actions and opinions invade your heart and mind.  And above all, you can decide whom to walk beside into tomorrow, and whom to leave behind today. What would you add to the list?  What’s one behavior you will not tolerate from others?  Please leave a comment below and let us know.

On the evening of her eightieth birthday, in a moment of genuine humility but obvious self-doubt she asked me, “Marc, at my age, do you think I still matter?  Do you think I still have more to achieve?”  I was completely speechless and I stumbled over my words for several seconds.  Here I am in the presence of someone whom I have an undying respect for, and she’s asking me whether or not she matters. I finally collected myself and said, “Grandma, yes – 110% yes!  You matter and you still have a lot to look forward to.  I’m not telling you this because I love you, but because it’s the truth.  As time rolls on you will prove this truth to yourself, and I will be there to support you every step of the way.” My grandmother sat silently for a moment, smiled and replied, “Thank you dear.  I needed to hear that.  I’m honestly looking forward to the journey ahead.” Over the course of the next decade, until she finally passed away at 90, my grandmother lived intently and joyously.  She wrote, painted, volunteered at hospitals and community centers, and learned several new skills (my favorite of which was playing the piano).  And of course, she remained a beacon of wisdom to everyone around her. Her moment of self-doubt always stuck with me though and I still think about it from time to time.  Now, all these years later, I realize that people in all walks of life lose hope every day – sometimes for just a few minutes and sometimes for prolonged periods of time. What’s most important is to remember that, regardless of our specific situation, there’s always hope to be found.  While we’re alive there’s always something meaningful left to experience and appreciate.  Here are some thoughts on what we all still have to live for… Every moment is equally special.  Every moment is a gift. Your life is not between the moments of your birth and death.  Your life is between now and your next breath.  The present moment is all the life there ever is. Your entire lifespan is simply composed of ‘right nows.’  The best is not in front of you or behind you.  It’s within you always in each moment. So my challenge to you is this:  Open your eyes.  Wake up.  Be attentive.  Appreciate this moment for what it is.  Regard the present as another chance to enjoy the sights, sounds, smells and sensations life has to offer.  Enjoy the big things that we often mistake as little things.  Read 1,000 Little Things. Gandhi once said, “Live as if you were to die tomorrow.  Learn as if you were to live forever.”  What this means to me in the simplest of terms:  Every day is a gift, and the gift is learning. Be a student of life.  Indulge in it, learn from it and absorb all the knowledge you can.  The purpose of your life is to live it in full, to experience it to the utmost, to reach out with an open mind for the newest and richest experience being offered at the time. Don’t be afraid of death; be afraid of leaving the rest of your life unlived.  You don’t have to live forever; you just have to live passionately right now while you have a chance.  Keep in mind that life hasn’t afforded everyone this chance.  You have been gifted a priceless opportunity. Forget about how you thought things were supposed to be.  Just because some things didn’t work out as you had expected, or didn’t happen as fast as you thought they would, is no excuse to give up on yourself.  Time passes one way or the other.  Do what you need to do so that, at the very least, you can look back someday and say, “I gave life my best shot.”  Read Tuesdays with Morrie. Human beings don’t become wise by reading books – they become educated.  Living out experiences firsthand in the real world, one day at a time, is what gives birth to wisdom.  Ultimately wisdom is what you get when you test out the waters for yourself.  This kind of life experience is the most valuable asset you own. Sometimes on the road to acquiring wisdom life will beat you down, but you have to stand back up.  Because nothing is more beautiful and powerful than a soul who has weather and grown through life’s difficulties.  Don’t regret your time, even the moments that were filled with hurt.  Smile because you learned from it all and because you gained enough strength to rise above it all. In the end, it’s not what you have been through that matters; it’s how you got through it that defines your life and your legacy. Learn to give, even if it’s just a smile, not because you have too much, but because you know there are so many others out there who feel like they have nothing at all.  You always have the ability to be kind, and kindness really does make the world a better place. Smile at people who look like they’re having a rough day.  Give them a hand if you’re able.  Kindness is the only investment that never fails, and wherever there’s another human being there’s an opportunity for kindness. As a bonus, when you’re kind to others and bring happiness into their lives, you will not be able to keep it from yourself either.  Read The How of Happiness. The greatest thinking trap is self-rejection.  When you begin to believe the negative voices in your head that sometimes call you worthless, then the thought of leaving this world can seem like an attractive option.  What you need to realize is: these negative voices are lies. As soon as someone accuses you or criticizes you, as soon as you are rejected, left alone, or abandoned for a short time, you might find yourself thinking, “Well, that proves once again that I am a nobody.”  What you need to realize is, these other people are NOT worthy of YOU. Self-rejection is the greatest enemy of emotional growth because it contradicts the sacred inner voice that calls you “worthy.”  And being worthy constitutes the core truth of every human existence. Say it out loud if you have to:  “This is my journey, and I am worthy of the trip.” As Hemingway so profoundly said, “It is good to have an end to journey toward; but it is the journey that matters, in the end.” You may feel discouraged.  You may feel upset.  You may feel too old.  You may be sick.  You may be divorced.  You may be unemployed. You may be financially strapped.  You may be…  etc. But you’re not dead – YOU ARE ALIVE.  Your journey is not over. NO matter what, this simple fact alone is proof that you still have something meaningful to achieve. What makes you feel most alive?  What gives your life meaning?  Leave us a comment below and let us know. Photo by: Jhong Dizon "

But, we found a way. We pushed ourselves as hard as we could to take one tiny step every day—one journal entry, one 10-minute workout, one honest conversation, and so forth.  It wasn’t easy, but the tiny steps were manageable and we gradually grew stronger.  And believe it or not, that’s basically what I did again this morning.  I was desperately struggling to motivate myself for the past few days after a significant business opportunity fell through.  I was feeling utterly defeated.  So, I took the tiniest possible step.  Just turning on my laptop, opening up the word processing application, and writing a single sentence.  Such an action is so small as to seem insignificant, and yet so easy as to be possible when I was feeling desperate and defeated again this morning.  And it showed me that the next step was possible, and the next.  And the end result is the couple paragraphs you’ve just finished reading. Why am I telling you this? Because I know we all need a healthy reminder sometimes… to do the hard things we need to do to be happy.  The things that frighten us.  The things others can’t do for us.  The things that make the difference between existing and living—between knowing the path and walking the path—between a life of empty promises and defeat and one filled with renewed happiness, possibility and peace. And, along these lines, I have some great news: Marc and I wrote three bestselling books (one of them is a New York Times bestseller) to guide us—all of us—through that necessary journey of doing the hard things.  I sincerely wish I could have read these books over a decade ago.  In many ways, it would have saved me from myself.  It absolutely would have saved me from intense periods of darkness that were born primarily from my subconscious attempt to take the easy way out of the painful realities I faced.

But, we found a way. We pushed ourselves as hard as we could to take one tiny step every day—one journal entry, one 10-minute workout, one honest conversation, and so forth.  It wasn’t easy, but the tiny steps were manageable and we gradually grew stronger.  And believe it or not, that’s basically what I did again this morning.  I was desperately struggling to motivate myself for the past few days after a significant business opportunity fell through.  I was feeling utterly defeated.  So, I took the tiniest possible step.  Just turning on my laptop, opening up the word processing application, and writing a single sentence.  Such an action is so small as to seem insignificant, and yet so easy as to be possible when I was feeling desperate and defeated again this morning.  And it showed me that the next step was possible, and the next.  And the end result is the couple paragraphs you’ve just finished reading.

Purkey This moment will be part of your story someday.  It’s not right or wrong.  It’s not perfect.  It just is – a blank canvas – a completely unrestricted space that you can use as you please.  To laugh.  To get rambunctious.  To muse.  To create.  To express your freedom to be as you are. You have to live each moment consciously in your own way, design your own truth, and then share it with others.  It’s a process of growth you gradually realize as an individual.  You can’t acquire it from others; you can only share it once you’ve created it.  You have to break out of your shell and do things.  Do what moves you.  Be who you are.  Explore life’s mysteries until you figure out what matters most to you. If you sit around for too long, blaming others for the things they did or didn’t do, or knew or didn’t know, you’ll remain sitting in one spot until you pass.  Placing blame is easy, because it means you don’t have to do anything; you just have to sit around for your entire life.  But that’s not living; that’s dying.  To accept where you are without blame by seizing the present for what it is – for the opportunities it’s giving you every instant – that’s what injects life into your story and ultimately moves you forward. With all of this in mind, here are six things you should love about your life: The wisest and happiest are those who are respectful of their time, annoyed at the needless loss of it, and use it dutifully to grow as they age.  Sadly, too many of us age much faster than we grow.  We spend so much of our lives going through the external motions of what society tells us ‘maturity’ is – getting married, buying houses, working our way up the corporate ladder, etc. – that we fail to concentrate on our own inner growth and goals.  We never allocate enough time just for us. Part of the problem is that we’re always waiting for some condition to resolve itself at some point in the future.  We believe that the right time to take the next step is somehow going to magically happen tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, etc.  But one day we wake up and realize we’re no closer than we were long ago.  We find ourselves asking, “How did it get so late, and why haven’t I moved?”  In other words, we’ve aged, but we never grew to our potential.  We never fulfilled ourselves. Let this be your wake-up call.  This is life.  Right now.  Indulge in it.  Make it count.  Because it’s happening.  Read 1,000 Little Things. The world can easily be a tragedy if all you do is feel without ever acting.  To feel something and believe in it, and not to live it, is lying to yourself.  If you do this for too long you will never do more than exist meekly from one robotic motion to the next.  You will live a lie every day as the truth haunts your thoughts every night.  You simply can’t get away from your truth by moving dishonestly from one place to the next. If any of this hits too close to home, take a stand right now.  Stop sipping the denial cocktail and take a shot of the delightful truth.  Wherever your heart is, there you will find the reality that brings YOU to life.  The time to act on your truth is now. Your perspective on things is important; it enables you to make sense of the life you lead.  Always keep in mind, though, that different people have different perspectives, and yours isn’t the only one that makes sense.  There are few black and white facts in this world.  Most facts are simply interpretations.  You begin to learn wisely when you’re willing to see life from other people’s perspectives too. Even as you grow wiser and wiser with age you must remind yourself that an understanding is never absolutely final.  What’s currently right could easily be wrong later.  Thus, the most destructive illusion is a settled point of view.  Since life is continuous growth and movement, choosing a fixed point of view is essentially a declaration of death. Success in life does not depend on always being or proving that you’re right.  To make real progress you must let go of the assumption that you already have all the answers.  You can listen to others, learn from them, and successfully work with them even though you may not agree with every opinion they have.  When people respectfully agree to disagree, everyone benefits from the diversity of perspective.  Read Buddha’s Brain. It’s not about finding someone to lose yourself in, it’s about meeting someone to find yourself in.  When you connect with someone special – a friend or lover – this person helps you find the best in yourself.  In this way, neither of you actually meet the best in the each other; you both grow into your best selves by spending time together and nurturing each other’s growth. When you honestly ask yourself who these special people are in your life, you will often find that it’s those who, instead of giving you things or taking things from you (advice, answers, material possessions, etc.), have chosen rather to share in your joy and pain, and experience life along with you through good times and bad. Forget what everyone else thinks of you; chances are, they aren’t thinking about you anyway.  If you feel like they always are, understand that this perception of them watching you and critiquing your every move is a complete figment of your imagination.  It’s your own inner fears and insecurities that are creating this illusion.  It’s you judging yourself that’s the problem. You judge yourself by telling yourself a story inside of your head.  Every moment of every day you’re telling yourself this story.  You are building your future around this story, so tell it right.  Create a positive narrative about your dreams and goals that include only the circumstances that matter.  What you think others are thinking about you is not part of this narrative, and neither are your negative self-judgments.  Read Uncertainty. You are never at the total mercy of life’s surprises.  No matter what life throws at you, you can decide what these events mean to you in the short term, the long term, and how you will integrate them into your life.  Everything that happens is subject to your interpretation of it.  Thus, far more important than what happens, is what you choose to do with what happens, and your options are abundant. The life you live is ultimately the life you choose.  Choose to focus on the negative, and negativity will indeed surround you.  Turn your focus to the positive possibilities, and these possibilities gradually become realities in your life.

It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”?Albert Einstein You do know you talk to yourself in your mind all the time, right? Pretty much every one of us has a non-stop stream of thoughts – a mental monologue – that has a powerful impact on how we feel, how we behave, and how we live our lives.  Too often, this mental monologue consists of unhelpful thoughts that hinder our happiness and effectiveness. Which is why it’s time to stop thinking about… You were born to be you, not who they tell you to be.  You are not here to be perfect; you are here to be true.  Be gentle and kind to your heart and soul.  Accept who you are, where you are, and where you came from. Don’t make a decision based solely on popularity, or based on what others think is right for you.  Just because others are doing something doesn’t mean it’s the best choice for you. Listen to your gut.  Now is the moment to follow your intuition and pursue what matters most to you.  Reach deep within yourself and awaken to the purpose that moves you and makes you feel alive.  The world is filled with opportunities to do an infinite number of things, so why not align your efforts with the activities that speak to your soul. Instead of thanking the heavens for two strong legs and a body that’s capable of running and jumping and dancing, lots of people complain about their weight and appearance. Instead of appreciating that they live in a country that protects their basic human rights and civil liberties, lots of people complain about laws, taxes, and politicians. Instead of being grateful for the roof they have over their heads, lots of people wish they had a larger house and a fancier car. Don’t be one of these people. To witness miracles unfold in your daily life, count your blessings and be thankful for what you DO have.  Lots of people aren’t so lucky.  Read The Happiness Project. As Franklin D. Roosevelt so profoundly said, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” That’s the honest truth.  The real thing that keeps you down is fear.  The reason your fears have so much power over you is simply because you give them this power by thinking about them – the worst-case scenario, what you don’t want to happen, etc. It’s time to take a stand.  It’s time to clear your fears from your thoughts.  It’s time to acknowledge that your fear of grief is far worse than the grief you fear. Why regret?  This moment doesn’t have any mistakes in it yet.  It’s brand new. You have a choice to make right here, right now.  You can hold onto old mistakes or you can make progress going forward with the new beginning you’ve just been given. It’s time to be bold.  It’s time to stop reading the previous chapter of your life and start writing the one you’re currently living.  Learn from your old mistakes and march confidently on.  Sure you’ll make new mistakes along the way, but that’s the whole point – you want to learn from new mistakes, not rot alongside old ones. Living means taking chances that are worth taking and making mistakes that are worth making.  Right now is simply a new chance to get it right, but you have to let go and take this chance. You will grow much stronger and find peace once you stop picking at your old wounds.  Consciously replaying a painful memory over and over in your head is self-abuse.  Your past has given you the strength and awareness you have today.  Don’t let it haunt you.  Celebrate it. Your wounds are your wisdom.  Let them heal.  Let them scar. In order for this to occur, you must know why you felt the way you did, what you learned from it, and why you no longer need to feel that way.  It’s about accepting the past, letting it be, and pushing your spirit forward. You may carry a small scar with you for the rest of your life.  Realize that this is perfectly OK.  A scar is the effect of healing – it’s what makes you whole again.  Read 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently. You could spend your entire life trying to impress everyone around you.  Of course, it wouldn’t get you very far. Purposely impressing people is an act that brings nothing but a fleeting ego boost.  Be real instead.  Connect with fewer people on a level that is deeper and more profound. If you want to impress someone, impress yourself by making progress on something you’re sincerely proud of.  It’s truly amazing what you can accomplish when you aren’t worried about what everyone around you thinks. The point here is simple:  STOP thinking and START doing. The road of life is jam packed with dreams that aren’t going anywhere.  Why?  Because the people driving these dreams haven’t started their engines.  So many people endlessly put off until tomorrow what they could do today.  There are literally millions of promising, intelligent people in this world who have no plan at all, who wait for others to drive and steer their lives and their dreams for them. Having a dream without an action plan is exactly like a beautiful sports car without an engine.  You know what she could do if she could do it, but she can’t.  Turn your dream into an actionable plan and then start executing your plan.  Make no promise for tomorrow when you have the opportunity to make progress today. An aerial view of a big project always looks daunting.  But once you break it down into small parts, suddenly it’s no longer a big, impossible project.  It’s simply a bunch of little, achievable ones. The key is to subdivide a big project into smaller tasks and break each task down further into logical steps for each task.  Thinking about the big picture is important on occasion to keep track of your progress, but on a daily basis you should be focused only on the step you’re taking at the time. The toughest part is laying out what you actually have to do to get each task done, but it’s worth the time and effort.  By thinking about it, and breaking it down, you’ve already accomplished the hardest part – you’ve built yourself a step-by-step instruction manual for getting the project completed.  Read Getting Things Done. Some parts of your life are simply meant to be lived, not controlled.  No matter what happens, no matter the outcome, you’re going to be just fine.  Let the things you can’t control, happen. Spend your thoughts and efforts on controlling what you do have power over, rather than wasting your peace of mind on the uncontrollable. Sometimes we avoid experiencing exactly where we are because we have developed a belief, based on past experiences, that it is not where we should be or want to be.  But the truth is, where you are now is exactly where you need to be to get to where you want to go tomorrow. The present moment is always filled with wonder.  Right now is a phenomenon.  Right now extraordinary things are happening.  If you are attentive, you will see them. What’s something you often think about that you know hurts you more than it helps you?  Leave a comment below and let us know.

Those people who take the time and initiative to pursue knowledge on their own are the only ones who earn a real education in this world.  Take a look at any widely acclaimed scholar, entrepreneur or historical figure you can think of.  Formal education or not, you’ll find that he or she is a product of continuous self-education. If you’re interested in learning something new, this article is for you.  Broken down by subject and/or category, here are several top-notch self-education resources I have bookmarked online over the past few years. Note that some of the sources overlap between various subjects of education.  Therefore, each has been placed under a specific subject based on the majority focus of the source’s content.

"10 Motivational Quotes and Tips for Hard Times|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-motivational-quotes.jpg?resize=500%2C377&ssl=1| Surely you remember the good old days – those fun-loving pastimes when the whole world seemed a bit brighter.  Let’s travel back in time.  Shall we? Here’s how to get back to good… To move forward in life you must first accept the reality of what it is.  This acceptance provides you with an important starting point from which you can move in any direction you choose.  To deny this reality or to fight against the past will merely waste your time and energy.  To wish that things were different, or to pretend that they are, gets you nowhere. Instead, visualize the possibilities and the path forward with a calm, collected mind.  Then determine the next logical step that will take you in the direction of your vision and step forward.  Read The Road Less Traveled. When you adopt an attitude that life owes you something you set yourself up for frustration and unhappiness.  Realize instead that life has already provided you with a world filled with abundance, and that creating meaningful value out of this abundance is up to you. No matter who you are, where you’re from, or what your socioeconomic status is, a life of fulfillment requires commitment and effort from you.  It is through positive, productive choices that you line up life’s abundance in ways that uniquely express your personal dreams and values. You need space to try things and create things.  It takes a long time to recalibrate if you let people pull at you all the time.  A lot of stress comes from reacting to stuff.  You have to keep a certain guard up against these negative influences. Build an emotional barrier and allow yourself to dream and explore the passions that speak to the essence of who you are.  Then let those dreams and passions pull you steadily through the practical, hands-on work of bringing them to life.  Work through each day with diligence and persistence, doing what’s required.  And as you do, stay close to the dreamer that always lives within you. Sometimes you can hold so tightly to what you know that you deny yourself the opportunity to learn and experience great new things.  And in the back of your mind you know this and it bothers you.  You become so worried about losing comfort that you cease to be comfortable. When you’re willing to let go a little, you can actually discover and enjoy a lot more.  Because when your energy is not consumed by possessiveness and fear, you have more energy available to experience life. Instead of striving to hold tightly to everything, let it come, let it go, and let the next moment bring its own unique wonder.  Read The Untethered Soul. Each new day greets you with no rules except the ones you place on it.  So greet it with open arms and positive thoughts.  Let the possibilities inspire you and keep you going.  Others may call you an idealist or naive or some other belittling title, ignore them. Life is not about what you could do, it’s about what you will do.  Write this down: “My life has unlimited possibilities.”  Choose to find these possibilities in everything that comes your way, and no problem will ever be able to conquer you. The power of the phrase “I can’t” is frightening.  It makes strong people weak, happy people sad, blinds those who can see, turns the brave into cowards, robs the brilliance of every genius, causes the rich to think poorly, and limits the potential of that highly capable brain inside your head. Replace “I can’t” with “I can” and then try again.  When you experience a negative circumstance in your life, do not dwell on it.  Be proactive – direct your attention to the possible action steps that will bring you to a positive result. There’s nothing more rewarding than helping someone realize their own self-worth.  Your life will not likely be measured by a single great achievement; it will be measured by thousands of small ones that all compound on top of one another.  Each time you perform an act of kindness or bring a smile to someone’s face it gives your life more meaning. So act like what you do makes a difference – it does. You can be the most beautiful person on the inside and out in the whole wide world, and everybody who sees you is awestruck, but if you yourself don’t see and feel it, none of it matters. Every moment you spend doubting your self-worth – every moment you spend negatively judging yourself – is a tragic moment, for it is a moment of your life that you chose to throw away.  Don’t do this.  You only have so many moments. The love you seek is seeking you at this very moment, you just have to open up to it. As Albert Einstein once said, “Excessive possessions, seeking outward success, extreme publicity, luxuries – to me these have always been contemptible.  I believe that a simple and unassuming manner of life is best for everyone, best for both the body and the mind.” In other words, in thinking, be down to earth.  In necessitates, keep to the essential.  In conflicts, be fair.  In leading others, guide instead of controlling.  In work, tap into your passion.  In relationships, be completely genuine and present.  Keep it all straightforward and simple.  Read The Power of Less. The foundation of a good life is all around you.  Experience the joy in life’s universal elements… To find the fresh air and a light breeze exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening stroll; to be thrilled by the sun’s warmth and the flickering stars at night; to be elated over the sound of a rain shower or a wildflower in the Springtime.  Etc. These are some of the greatest rewards of a truly good life.

For the past twelve years, since I entered college, I’ve been on the road – traveling (business and pleasure), studying, living in different cities, working for different companies (and myself), and meeting remarkable and unusual people everywhere in between. Today I want to share twelve life lessons I’ve learned along the way. And remember, sometimes a break from your routine is the very thing you need.  Sometimes you need to take a step back to see things clearly.  Traveling is one of the best ways I know to remain psychologically grounded.  If you’ve been stuck in an emotional rut for awhile, without any positive change, perhaps it’s time to take a short hiatus – get out of town for a few days, experience something new, and stimulate your mind. Photo by: Matthew 7 Things Happy People Say Every Day|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/8-happy-people-say.jpg?resize=500%2C354&ssl=1| All the happiness you ever find lies within you. Happiness is a choice.  For every minute you are angry or irritated, you lose 60 seconds of happiness.  Be happy.  Be yourself.  If others don’t like it, then let them be.  Life isn’t about pleasing everybody. If you have the courage to admit when you’re scared, the ability to laugh even as you cry, the nerve to speak up, even if your voice is shaking, the confidence to ask for help when you need it, and the wisdom to take it when it’s offered, then you have everything you need to get yourself to a happier state of mind. Begin today by taking responsibility for your own contentment.  Here are ten ways to choose happiness: And remember, your mind is your private sanctuary; do not allow the negative beliefs of others to occupy it.  Your skin is your barrier; do not allow others to get under it.  Take control of your boundaries and what you allow yourself to absorb from others. Never let someone’s opinion become your reality.  Never sacrifice who you are because someone else has a problem with it.  Love who you are inside and out.  No one else has the power to make you feel small unless you give them that power.  You are the only one who can create your happiness. The choice is yours.  Choose happiness.

Even if you are generally a happy person, take a look at these seven habits to determine if any of them are keeping you from experiencing greater amounts of joy. Don’t play it so safe that you put yourself in situations where none of your potential options satisfy your calling.  Dream your dream, but also realize that you are more than just the dreamer, you are the point of origin for your dream’s reality. Your dream is your creative vision for your future life.  You must break out of your current comfort zone and become comfortable with the unfamiliar.  Start smashing through those emotional barriers.  Move forward.  Life doesn’t magically give you what you want in your mind; it gives you what you insist upon with your actions.  Read The Power of Habit. You will inevitably become who you believe yourself to be. If you spend enough time saying, “I’m not smart enough, thin enough and rich enough,” it’s likely that you will someday be right.  On the contrary, if you have the belief that you are smart enough, thin enough and rich enough now to take the next positive step forward, over time you will likely acquire the capacity to be these very things at your desired level of expectation. Sometimes people put too much interest into trying to control every tiny aspect of their lives.  Learn to let go, relax and ride the path that life takes you.  Try something new, take a chance, but above all, smile and enjoy the scenery. Freeing yourself from trying to control the insignificant things lets you experience more of the good stuff around you.  The greatest joys in life are often the unexpected surprises that arrive when you are flexible and open to life’s twists and turns.  Read Buddha’s Brain. You won’t drop two jean sizes overnight.  Your relationships won’t grow without your attention.  You can’t pay off $25K in debt in a week.  Your new business venture won’t instantly turn a profit. You’re going to make mistakes every now and then.  You will go a day or two when you feel like you’re running in place.  You’re going to try new techniques and they’re not always going to work.  You’re a human being.  You’re going to fail from time to time.  But that’s how you grow.  Worthwhile goals take work and persistence. The greatest discovery you will ever make is that you can change your life by simply changing your attitude.  Optimism is the most essential human trait, because it allows you to evolve your ideas and improve every situation you encounter. So don’t take things for granted.  Be positive and realize how fortunate you are.  Not every day will be perfect, but if you pay attention you’ll realize that 99.9% of the time you’re having either a good day or a great day. You DO have enough time to exercise.  If you say otherwise, you’re lying to yourself.  The truth is you don’t have time not to, or sooner or later you’ll be making time for illness. At least 30 minutes of exercise every day has been proven on countless occasions by countless medical studies to increase the strength, happiness and longevity of human lives.  You’re talking about three and a half hours a week.  That’s hardly seems an excessive amount of time considering the tremendous benefits in terms of the impact on the remaining 164.5 hours of the week.  Read The 4-Hour Body. As Oscar Wilde once said, “Everything in moderation, including moderation.” Eating too much makes you fat.  Spending too much money makes you broke.  Working too much leaves your family at home missing you.  Playing too much leaves important work undone…  And so on and so forth. Happiness depends on the balancing act of applying your positive resources equally to the hungry deficits in your life.  All details aside, the important thing to remember is this:  Long-term happiness is never found in one good thing; it is a combination, it is a balanced lifestyle.

"60 Short Love Stories to Cheer You Up|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/60-short-love-stories.jpg?resize=500%2C363&ssl=1| May your actions speak louder than your words. May your life preach louder than your lips. May your success be your noise in the end. The result of enormous success is often pretty noisy — lots of people talking, writing, and sharing stories about it. The actual process of achieving enormous success, on the other hand, is far more discreet. But it’s this process that happens quietly, behind-the-scenes, that makes all the difference in the world. Marc and I are fortunate enough to know a number of enormously successful human beings. Regardless of lifestyle, industry or profession, they share many of the same quiet habits. And that’s precisely what I want to discuss with you today. Here are twelve key things the most successful people we know do quietly and diligently: [Read more…]  Let’s cut to the chase today. What you ultimately do in life comes out of who you believe you are. You have to practice believing in yourself and ignoring the naysayers. Because while you may not be able to control the impolite and unfair things some people say and do, you can press forward and decide not to be endlessly derailed by them. Of course, I know that’s all much easier said than done, but you must remind yourself that it can be done! How? Start by leveraging the right daily affirmations. After all, it’s not what others say about you, and it’s not what you broadcast to everyone else that determines the trajectory of your life. It’s what you whisper to yourself behind [Read more…]  You ultimately become what you repeatedly do. If your habits aren’t helping you, they’re hurting you. Here are some fairly common and widespread examples of the latter that will drain all your joy if you let them: Try to use frustration and inconvenience to motivate you rather than annoy you. You are in control of the way you look at life. Instead of getting angry, find the lesson. In place of envy, feel admiration. In place of worry, take action. In place of doubt, have faith. Remember that your response is always more powerful than your present circumstance. A small part of your life is decided by completely uncontrollable circumstances, while the vast majority of your life is decided by your responses. Where you ultimately end up is heavily dependent on [Read more…]  A good morning, and thus a good day, aren’t just experiences that magically happen — they are created consciously. Most of us are distracted from the get-go every morning. Trivial activities like checking social media, watching TV, and worrying about things we can’t control often set the tone of the day. And that means we waste our most well-rested time on things that don’t matter, while gradually losing touch with the significant, controllable parts of our lives that actually do matter. We simply forget that the morning hours are enormously important — they form the foundation from which the day is built. We forget that how we choose to spend these hours can be used to predict the kind of days we’re going to have, and ultimately the kind of lives we’re going to live. So if you feel like you’ve been getting a rough start lately, and stumbling through your days with diminished intention and focus, it’s time to consider [Read more…]  Perhaps it takes courage to raise children… Our youth can’t possibly know how age thinks and feels. And likewise, as we age we are often guilty of being so busy-brained that we forget what it was like to be young. Spending time with my young son helps me tap into my younger mind — he keeps me on my toes. For that I am grateful, but I still struggle as a parent. I struggle to be present. I struggle to be patient. I struggle to remember. Almost every single day. Truth be told, every parent battles with parenthood in their own way. Because parenting is not easy. What helps me is journaling about the lessons parenthood is gradually teaching me, and then referring back to what I’ve learned when I’m struggling and forgetful. Today, I want to share some quotes from my parenting journal with you. Perhaps they will assist you someday, the way they have assisted me again this morning… [Read more…] 10 Things I Wish I Knew When I Was Your Age|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-i-was-your-age.jpg?resize=500%2C463&ssl=1| “One day you will look back and see that all along you were blooming.”— MHN Twenty-seven years ago, when I was a freshman in high school, my English teacher gave my class a homework assignment entitled, “Advice for a Younger Generation.” The concept of the assignment was simple: Each student had to interview a person who was over the age of 25, gather enough information to write a basic biography of their life and find out what their top tips are for a younger generation. I chose to interview my dad. He was 53 at the time and he gave me 18 pieces of advice. I had completely forgotten about all of this until last week when I was visiting my parents. My mom had me clean out a few old boxes stored in the attic. In one of these boxes I found the original “Advice for a Younger Generation” assignment dated April 22nd, 1996. I read through it and was admittedly blown away — there’s lots of solid wisdom within. Even though my dad’s advice is generally relevant to a person of any age, my 41-year-old self can relate to it in a way my 14-year-old self didn’t quite grasp at the time. In fact, the first thought that went through my head was, “Wow, my dad was right!” Here are his 18 pieces of advice for a younger generation, transcribed with his permission. Adults are just older children. When you get older you won’t feel as old as you imagine you will. For the most part, you still feel exactly the way you feel right now, just a little wiser and more confident. You’ve had time to establish your place in the world and figure out what’s important to you. Don’t fear growing up. Look forward to it. It’s awesome! Part of living and growing up is experiencing unexpected troubles in life. People lose jobs, get in car accidents, and sometimes die. When you are younger, and things are going pretty well, this harsh reality can be hard to visualize. The smartest and oftentimes hardest thing we can do in these kinds of situations is to be tempered in our reactions. To want to scream obscenities, but to be wiser and more disciplined than that. To remember that emotional rage only makes matters worse. And to remember that tragedies are rarely as bad as they seem, and even when they are, they give us an opportunity to grow stronger. Making one person smile can change the world. Maybe not the whole world, but their world. So start small and start now. Be patient. Be present. Be kind. Compliment people. Magnify their strengths, not their weaknesses. This is how to make a difference, in your own life above all, and in all the lives you touch. Everyone and everything seems normal from a distance, or at a glance. The 10th, 20th, or even the 50th impression is when you start to truly understand someone else for who they truly are. Be patient and present. Pay attention to their habits and rituals. We are what we habitually do. Concentrate your efforts on smaller and smaller areas. Specialize. When your efforts are diffused over a wide area they won’t have much of an impact. So focus on smaller areas and your efforts will be felt more fully. It could take time for growth to happen, but keep that focus narrow and the results will come in time. Strive to be the “you” you want to be. Nourish your mind and body. Don’t stop learning. Educate yourself every day until you die. Study. Read. Devour new ideas. Engage with people, including those who think differently. Ask questions. Listen. And don’t just grow in knowledge. Be a person who gives back too. Put your uncertainty and fears aside for a second and ask yourself this: “If I try and I don’t get it right the first time, what will I have lost and what will I have gained?” The answer is: You will have lost nothing but a little bit of your time while gaining an important lesson that will help you get it right the second or third time. People rarely get it right the first time. In fact, usually the only people who ever get it right are those who continue going for it even when they’ve come up short numerous times before. Supporting, guiding, and making contributions to other people is one of life’s greatest rewards. Almost everything you do comes back around in some way. Let your actions create positive ripples in your life. If you can avoid it, don’t fight. Step back from arguments with your spouse, family members, or neighbors. When you feel anger surging up and you want to yell that vulgar remark on the tip of your tongue, just close your mouth and take a break. Sleep on it. Give yourself space. Let calmness be your superpower, and then revisit the situation if you must. You don’t have to be right or win an argument immediately. Purposely impressing people is an act that brings nothing but a momentary ego boost. Be real with people instead. Connect with fewer people on a level that is deeper and more profound. Fun is way underrated! With all of life’s responsibilities, fun will sometimes seem like an indulgence. It shouldn’t be. It should be a requirement. Make time for fun and casual play. Schedule it in until the day you die! There is a world of magnificence hidden in simplicity. Identify the five most important things in your life now and focus on those things in your free time. Let the other stuff go. Stop the senseless busyness most people fill their lives with, so you can enjoy what’s truly important to you. So pay attention to them. Like watching your child sleep. Preparing a holiday meal with your family. Sharing a great laugh with an old friend. This is the real stuff life is made of. Tune in. Most people don’t need lots of advice, they need to live. I’ve seen young, rocky relationships develop into wonderful marriages, and I’ve seen fleeting inspirations ignite a lifetime of passion and happiness. Our life stories, like the answers we give to long essay questions, are uniquely ours. What people want to know is already somewhere inside of them. We all just need time to think, be, and continue to explore the imperfect journeys that will eventually help us find our long-term direction. Your situation and environment is ever changing, so be careful not to confuse things that are urgent with things that are important. Evaluate your obligations on a monthly basis and be willing to make necessary shifts. And remember that good, admirable obligations, like volunteering at church, will sometimes need to be put on hold temporarily for something else. And that’s OK. You can’t do it all. Don’t buy stuff you don’t need.  Don’t spend more than you make.  Don’t spend to impress people. Don’t let your money manage you in the long run. Financial stability is peace of mind when you get older. While you may not use the specifics of every classroom lesson, every lesson does expand the core thought process of your mind. Over time you will develop problem-solving skills that are universally applicable. No single classroom lesson can teach this, and no single classroom lesson is more important. Don’t dream about it anymore. Start doing it a little bit every day. In 40 years from now, what is it that you will regret not having accomplished, appreciated, or attempted? Do it, appreciate it, and attempt it starting NOW! My dad is 80-years-old now, and although he says he generally agrees with all of his younger self’s advice, I’m sure he’s learned a few new tricks over the past twenty-seven years. So earlier today as I was transcribing this, I asked him if he would share a few of these new tricks with us. He said he will in the near future, so sign up for our email updates and stand by for a new article from him. 🙂 But in the mean time, he told me to tell you to read his three favorite personal development books: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, The Millionaire Next Door, and 1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently (yes, he shamelessly plugged our book, but he actually re-reads it for daily self-reflection, so it’s legitimate). Finally, before you go, please leave my dad (and Angel and me) a comment below to let us know what you think of this article and its advice. Your feedback is truly important to us.

"How To Make Good Things Happen|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/make-good-things-happen.jpg?resize=500%2C328&ssl=1|This guest post was written by Diggy, author of Upgrade Reality.When wild animals are first captured and put into zoo cages they try everything to get out of that cage.  They bite it, run into it with their full weight, and claw at the cage.  They persist for weeks and months and they take any chance they can to free themselves.But after a few years of captivity these wild animals lose their fierce desire to be free.  You could leave the cage door unlocked so the animals could escape if they wanted to, but they won’t.  They won’t even try, because they’ve become comfortable and given up the instinct that they could ever be free again.Are you like these wild animals in a cage?  Have you lost your initiative to succeed and make good things happen in your life?You may think your past is indicative of your future, and that you’ve been cast in an imprisoning mold.  You may believe that just because you haven’t yet been successful in X, Y or Z that you will never be successful in that venture and you may as well accept your fate.The mindset of your past being indicative of your future is a trap – an extremely easy and unnecessary trap.Your Wake-Up Call“Everything you can imagine is real.”  -Pablo PicassoYour reality can be whatever you want it to be.  The limits to what you can achieve are an illusion.  These achievement limits are mostly not set by others, but by you yourself.Often things are not as difficult as they seem:For years athletes couldn’t run one mile in under four minutes.  Once Roger Bannister ran a mile under four minutes, proving that the human heart could hold up when running that fast, others quickly followed.  And once Olympic champion, Vasily Alexeev broke the weight lifting barrier of 500 pounds, other weight-lifters broke his record knowing it was possible.  Yet before he could do it himself, Alexeev’s trainers changed his limiting belief by rigging 501.5 pounds of weights to look like 499.This is also true for how you have lived your life from the day you were born until this very moment.  You wake up each morning and do as you have been doing for years.  You’ve got a belief system setting limits for yourself as to what you can and deserve to achieve.People will jump at the chance to tell you what you can and cannot do.  Most people love to break down your dreams and get you to do what they think is best for you.  Sometimes your closest friends and family will crush your dreams without even realizing it.But remember that your dreams are yours.  They are what your heart knows and feels, and it doesn’t matter what others think of them.  (Read The Alchemist.)Take a close look at the following quotes and see how some of the most influential and talented people made incredibly strong statements that turned out to be totally false:“Everything that can be invented has already been invented.”– Director of the U.S. Patent Office, 1899 “A rocket will never be able to leave the earth’s atmosphere.”– The New York Times, 1936 “I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.”– IBM Chairman 1943 “Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?”– H.M. Warner, Warner Brothers, 1927”Upgrade Your RealityAgain, as Pablo Picasso once said, “Everything you can imagine is real.”Therefore, you can upgrade your current reality to a vision of what you want.  The way you perceive your reality to be is the way that your reality becomes.  Let me explain:You don’t need to be unhappy about the condition of your social life, your finances, your fitness or anything else that you’ve accepted as your reality just because ‘it’s always been like that.’There are countless examples of people who have come from nothing and built up some of the biggest companies in the world.  (Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Oprah).I know many of you reading this article will agree with me that change is possible and have areas in your life that you want to change.  But I also know that many of you who conceptually agree with this will not take action and persist long enough to see the change you want.Hard Work + Persistence = Guaranteed SuccessYou should not accept a frustrating, unhappy lifestyle.  As long as there is the slightest possibility of improvement through hard work and taking action, that’s exactly what you should do.With smart work, faith, commitment and persistence, you will become successful!  Whether it takes you a month or ten years, as long as you never give up and execute a strategy, you will succeed.Don’t expect a quick fix though.  Don’t expect to put in a little bit of effort for a small period of time and see your dreams come true.Transformation can take years.  Many successful people have failed multiple times before they get the big results.  But even though your situation won’t change drastically overnight it can change noticeably in a short time frame.  You can see a gradual improvement within days or weeks if you were to start today.The biggest obstacle to overcome in seeking improvement is the problem of, “Where do I start?”Even if you are motivated enough to research a solution or method for changing your situation, you’ll likely find many conflicting opinions and advice from all sorts of sources and gurus.The most sure-fire way of finding your strategy to success is to use a proven method.Find someone (or multiple people) who have already accomplished goals aligned with yours, and research their methods.  Don’t try to re-invent the wheel.  Just copy the masters and tweak their methods for you own circumstances.  This eliminates the guess-work and trial and error that you would encounter if you were to blaze your own trail.  (Read The Success Principles.)You Must Believe You Deserve ItAchieving success is only one part of the equation.  Keeping the success you achieved is an entirely different thing.You need to feel and believe that you are deserving of the success achieved.  Otherwise your subconscious will sabotage your process and put you back in a lesser situation that you feel you deserve.It may sound crazy, but it’s a fact of life.  Take the following quote as an example:“A shockingly large number of lottery winners end up in financial ruined.  National statistics show that about one-third of lottery winners ultimately file for bankruptcy.” -Milwaukee Magazine“The reality is nearly 70 percent of all lottery winners will squander away their winnings in a few years,” the Connecticut financial advisers said in a news release.  “In the process, they will see family and friendships destroyed and the financial security they hoped for disappear.”Even though people who win the lottery have suddenly received more money than they ever dreamed of, most of them will feel like it’s too good to be true.  Their mindset limits a financial transformation.  In their hearts they are still the same low-wage earning workers that they were before winning, which is why they end up losing all their money.  They feel stuck in their old situation, because that is what they feel they deserve.You may think the lottery example does not apply to you.  Just wait until I win the lottery!  The main point is that if you spend months or years working towards a final goal and achieve success, you need to feel like you deserve it completely.Be The Change you Want To SeeYou deserve to wake up in the morning and be happy.  You should feel good about yourself and excited about the life you’re living.  You should do work you love, be in the relationship that you’ve always wanted to be in and be healthy enough to enjoy it all.Start today.Be the change that you want to see.Make sure you feel it in every fiber of your being.Work hard, follow a proven strategy for success and never give up.Don’t just think about goals, take action and make good things happen!Diggy writes about personal development and has created a 122-page ebook under the same name at his blog: Upgrade Reality.

May your life preach louder than your lips. May your success be your noise in the end. The result of enormous success is often pretty noisy — lots of people talking, writing, and sharing stories about it. The actual process of achieving enormous success, on the other hand, is far more discreet. But it’s this process that happens quietly, behind-the-scenes, that makes all the difference in the world. Marc and I are fortunate enough to know a number of enormously successful human beings. Regardless of lifestyle, industry or profession, they share many of the same quiet habits. And that’s precisely what I want to discuss with you today. Here are twelve key things the most successful people we know do quietly and diligently: [Read more…]  Let’s cut to the chase today. What you ultimately do in life comes out of who you believe you are. You have to practice believing in yourself and ignoring the naysayers. Because while you may not be able to control the impolite and unfair things some people say and do, you can press forward and decide not to be endlessly derailed by them. Of course, I know that’s all much easier said than done, but you must remind yourself that it can be done! How? Start by leveraging the right daily affirmations. After all, it’s not what others say about you, and it’s not what you broadcast to everyone else that determines the trajectory of your life. It’s what you whisper to yourself behind [Read more…]  You ultimately become what you repeatedly do. If your habits aren’t helping you, they’re hurting you. Here are some fairly common and widespread examples of the latter that will drain all your joy if you let them: Try to use frustration and inconvenience to motivate you rather than annoy you. You are in control of the way you look at life. Instead of getting angry, find the lesson. In place of envy, feel admiration. In place of worry, take action. In place of doubt, have faith. Remember that your response is always more powerful than your present circumstance. A small part of your life is decided by completely uncontrollable circumstances, while the vast majority of your life is decided by your responses. Where you ultimately end up is heavily dependent on [Read more…]  A good morning, and thus a good day, aren’t just experiences that magically happen — they are created consciously. Most of us are distracted from the get-go every morning. Trivial activities like checking social media, watching TV, and worrying about things we can’t control often set the tone of the day. And that means we waste our most well-rested time on things that don’t matter, while gradually losing touch with the significant, controllable parts of our lives that actually do matter. We simply forget that the morning hours are enormously important — they form the foundation from which the day is built. We forget that how we choose to spend these hours can be used to predict the kind of days we’re going to have, and ultimately the kind of lives we’re going to live. So if you feel like you’ve been getting a rough start lately, and stumbling through your days with diminished intention and focus, it’s time to consider [Read more…]  Perhaps it takes courage to raise children… Our youth can’t possibly know how age thinks and feels. And likewise, as we age we are often guilty of being so busy-brained that we forget what it was like to be young. Spending time with my young son helps me tap into my younger mind — he keeps me on my toes. For that I am grateful, but I still struggle as a parent. I struggle to be present. I struggle to be patient. I struggle to remember. Almost every single day. Truth be told, every parent battles with parenthood in their own way. Because parenting is not easy. What helps me is journaling about the lessons parenthood is gradually teaching me, and then referring back to what I’ve learned when I’m struggling and forgetful. Today, I want to share some quotes from my parenting journal with you. Perhaps they will assist you someday, the way they have assisted me again this morning… [Read more…] 88 Ways To Make A Stranger

Tolerate|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/life-is-too-short-to-tolerate.jpg?resize=500%2C354&ssl=1|You don’t have to settle, it’s simply a choice you make every day.  If you feel like you’re running in place there’s a good chance you’re tolerating things you shouldn’t be.  It’s time to reclaim your life.Starting now, stop tolerating…People who bring you down. – Relationships should help you, not hurt you.  Spend time with nice people who are smart, driven and likeminded.A work environment or career field you hate. – Don’t settle on the first or second career field you dabble in.  Keep searching.  Eventually you will find work you love to do.  If you catch yourself working hard and loving every minute of it, don’t stop.  You’re on to something big.  Because hard work ain’t hard when you concentrate on your passions.Your own negativity. – Be aware of your mental self-talk.  We all talk silently to ourselves in our heads, but we aren’t always conscious of what we’re saying or how it’s affecting us.  Start listening to your thoughts.  If you hear negative thoughts, stop and replace them with positive thoughts.Unnecessary miscommunication. – Say what you mean.  Mean what you say.  Speak clearly.  Ask questions.  Clarify things until you understand them.A disorganized living and working space. – Clear the clutter.  Get rid of stuff you don’t use.  Read David Allen’s book Getting Things Done for some practical organizational guidance.Your own tardiness. – Get up 30 minutes earlier so you don’t have to rush around like a mad man.  That 30 minutes will help you avoid speeding tickets, tardiness and other unnecessary headaches.Pressure to fit in with the crowd. – Oftentimes, the only reason others want you to fit in is that once you do they can ignore you and go about their business.  Don’t conform.  Be you, because that’s the only person you can be.An unhealthy body. – Your health is your life.  Don’t let it go.  Eat right, exercise and get an annual physical check-up.  The 4-Hour Body is an insightful and entertaining read on this topic.Fear of change. – Life is change.  Every day is different.  Every day is a new beginning and a new ending.  Embrace it and make the best of it.All work and no play. – Enjoy yourself and have a little fun while you can.  If you’re smiling, you’re doing something right.People or beauty ads that make you feel inadequate. – Good looks attracts the eyes.  Personality attracts the heart.  Be proud to be you.  You are already beautiful.Not getting enough sleep. – A tired mind is rarely productive.Doing the same exact thing over and over again. – You are the sum of your life experiences.  The more you experience, the more interesting your life story gets.Personal greed. – Don’t let greed and deceit get the best of you.  Greed will bury even the lucky eventually.A mounting pile of debt. – Always live well below your means.  Don’t buy stuff you don’t need.  Always sleep on big purchases.  Create a budget and savings plan and stick to them.  Read I Will Teach You To Be Rich.Dishonesty. – Living a life of honesty creates peace of mind, and peace of mind is priceless.  Period.  Don’t be dishonest and don’t put up with people who are.Infidelity. – Intimate relationships are a sacred bond – a circle of trust.  If both parties aren’t 100% onboard the relationship isn’t worth fighting for.An unsafe home. – If you don’t feel safe at home you’ll never feel safe anywhere.  Build a loving household in a safe area that you are proud to call ‘home.’Being unprepared. – Life is unpredictable.  And there’s a big difference between being scared and being prepared.  Always be prepared.Inaction. – Either you’re going to take action and seize new opportunities or someone else will.  You can’t change anything or make any sort of progress by sitting back and thinking about it.And remember, you only live once, but if you live it right once is enough.Photo by: Anna Gay 20 Ways To Create Million Dollar Ideas|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/million-dollar-idea.jpg?resize=500%2C375&ssl=1|Big companies like Apple, super successful websites like Facebook, and bestselling books like The 4-Hour Workweek all have one thing in common:  They begin with a million dollar idea.The big question is:  How did their creators come up with these ideas?  Did they sit around waiting for an inspirational flash or a mystic spell of luck?The answer is:  Spontaneity and luck had little to do with it.In this article, we’ll take a brief look at 20 tried and true techniques that some of the brightest and most successful entrepreneurs have used to generate million dollar ideas.You don’t need to have a 100-person companyto develop and execute a good idea.– Larry Page (Google)Generate lots of ideas. – The more ideas you create, the more likely you are to create an idea worth a million bucks.Fail a lot. – All of the ideas that don’t work are simply stepping stones on your way to the one idea that does.  Sometimes you have to fail a thousand times to succeed.  No matter how many mistakes you make or how slow you progress, you are still way ahead of everyone who isn’t trying.Consume information consciously. – Some of my friends think it’s wasteful that I spend so much time reading books and blogs.  It’s not.  It’s what gives me an edge.  I feel engulfed with new ideas and information.  And I’ve actually used what I’ve learned to launch a few successful websites.  When you read things and interact with people, take off your consumer cap and put on your creator cap.  There are million dollar ideas (or at least some really good ideas) all around you waiting for discovery.Focus on topics and ideas with large markets. – A million dollars is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things, but it certainly is if you’re trying to earn it in a small market with limited opportunities.  Even if you put Steve Jobs in the role of CEO for a new venture with a maximum market size of 100 people he wouldn’t make more than a few cents.  ‘Big bucks’ result from high demand in a substantial market.Make sure there’s money in your market. – Bank robbers rob banks because that’s where the money is.  Before you become emotionally attached to an idea, do a little market research.  Make sure the idea you’re pursuing is where the money is.  Who are the clients and consumers?  How much disposable income do they have?  Etc.Keep your eyes, ears and mind wide open. – Oftentimes one idea’s failure will open a door to a new idea.  Don’t get so hung up on one failed attempt that you miss the opening for many more.Test variations of the same idea. – Think about the iPhone and the iPad for a second.  One is just a variation of the other.  Both are multi-million dollar ideas.Figure out what works well in one market and tailor it to another. – Find an idea that’s already proven and think about how it could be applied in a different context.  Take a formula that works in one niche and apply it to a new niche.  Or take the best aspects of one product and combine it with another product.Put the pieces together. – YouTube’s creators didn’t invent Flash.  They didn’t invent modern digital cameras that can record computer-ready mpeg video.  And they didn’t invent broadband Internet connections, cheap web hosting, embedded website content, or one-click website uploading technologies either.  What they invented is a technology that takes all of these existing pieces and combines them into an online video sharing portal.Spin a new twist on a previous breakthrough. – A new twist on an old idea can still be a million dollar idea.  Take Facebook for instance, it wasn’t the first big social networking site, but Mark Zuckerberg and company added twists and features the others did not grasp.  How can you take an existing million dollar idea, or even a common idea, and give it a new twist, a new direction and journey?Systematize a popular service into a reproducible product. – A service is productized when its ownership can be exchanged.  Think about Alienware and Dell back in their infancy.  Both companies simply systematized the service of building IBM compatible PCs and then sold them as a packaged product.  If you can convert a high demand service into a scalable, systematized, efficient process and sell it as a packaged deal, the million appears.Play with opposites. – When something becomes extremely popular, the opposite often also becomes popular as people turn away from the mainstream.  When WordPress, Blogger and Movable Type exploded in popularity by giving anyone with an Internet connection the ability to share long, detailed blog posts with the world, Twitter and Tumblr came along and started the micro-blogging revolution – for people grasping to share extremely short content snippets.  There are hundreds of other examples.  Just remember, the opposite of a million dollar idea can paradoxically give birth to another million dollar idea.Look for problems and solve them. – There are many real problems in this world.  Like a business owner wondering why his profits are sinking.  Like a golfer worrying about his slice.  Like a young man who is growing bald at 26.  Like a mom whose child is suffering with allergies.  Like a new dog owner who’s unsure what to do about her puppy barking all night.  Solving problems like these can make millions.Design new products that support other successful products. – How much money do you think iPod, iPhone and iPad case manufacturers are making?  Millions?  Billions?  What about companies that jumped into the market of manufacturing LCD and Plasma TV mounting brackets eight years ago?  You get the idea.Keep it simple. – Don’t over complicate a good idea.  Business marketing studies have shown that the more product choices offered, the less products consumers typically buy.  After all, narrowing down the best product from a pool of three choices is certainly easier than narrowing down the best product from a pool of three hundred choices.  If the purchasing decision is tough to make, most people will just give up.  So if you’re designing a product line, keep it simple.  (Read Made to Stick.)Exploit the resources and skills you already have. – It’s not as much about having the right resources as it is about exploiting your resources right now.  Stevie Wonder couldn’t see, so he exploited his sense of hearing into a passion for music, and he now has 25 Grammy Awards to prove it.  If you pursue a new venture that involves leveraging your resources and skills, you’re ahead of the game.Surround yourself with other thinkers. – You are the sum of the people you spend the most time with.  If you hang with the wrong people, they will affect you negatively.  But if you hang with the right people, you will be more capable and powerful than you ever could have been alone.  Find your tribe and collaborate to make a difference in all your lives.  Bounce ideas off each other, etc.  (Read Tribes.)Be enthusiastic about what you’re doing. – Enthusiasm is the lifeblood of creativity.  Big ideas blossom when you’re passionate and enthusiastic about what you’re doing.  It’s nearly impossible to pioneer ground breaking solutions in a domain where there is not passionate intensity.  But when your mind is stimulated by a fundamental curiosity and interest in the subject matter, your creativity will run rampant and your motivation will skyrocket.Accept constructive criticism, but ignore naysayers. – When someone spews negativity about your idea or product, remember, it doesn’t matter how many people don’t get it, it matters how many do.  No matter how much progress you make there will always be the people who insist that whatever you’re trying to do is impossible.  Or they may jealously suggest that the idea or concept as a whole is utterly ridiculous because nobody really cares.  When you come across these people, don’t try to reason with them.  Instead, forget that they exist.  They will only waste your time and energy.Actually do something with your ideas! – A million dollar idea is simply a good idea given the chance to grow.  On paper, Google and Facebook sprung from fairly ordinary ideas: ‘a search engine that’s accurate’ and ‘a website where friends connect with each other.’  Remember, neither of these companies were the first ones in their market.  Their ideas weren’t groundbreaking at the time.  Many people had the same ideas even before Google and Facebook existed.  But Google’s and Facebook’s creators did something with their ideas.  They worked hard and one-upped the competition.  Their initial success was in their execution.  Remember, it’s not the ideas themselves that count, it’s what you do with them. With the right execution, a simple idea can evolve into a million dollar idea.  (Read Making Ideas Happen.)Photo by: Noah Coffey "
"It’s Important That We See Things Differently|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/we-see-things-differently.jpg?resize=475%2C317&ssl=1|The Same ExperienceLast night, my buddy Anthony and I went out to a local bar for some drinks. Once inside, Anthony immediately saw a girl he was interested in. “Watch this,” he said.He sat down at the bar next to her, smiled, and quickly introduced himself.  But before he could say another word, she asked, “What happened to your eye?”“Oh, this,” Anthony said as he pointed to his black eye.  “It’s just a small battle wound from a triumphant, athletic victory.”“Oh,” she replied. “In what sports game?”“It’s not a game, it’s a battle,” he said with a smirk on his face. “I put my life on the line out there.”“Oh,” she replied again.  And although Anthony’s extravagant self-proclamations of being a backyard football champ have worked before, they didn’t work at all on this particular girl.  So she turned toward me. “And what do you do for fun?” she asked.“The same thing, I guess,” I said.“You battle?”“Well, I think of football more as a philosophical engagement.  I mean… when I’m competing against others, I try to deduce a series of logical next steps and then take action based on my calculations of weight, technique, past experience, and my gut instincts about how my opponents are engaging in the game.”She laughed. “With all that extra time spent thinking, you must get clobbered out there.”“Actually, he’s one of the most athletic players I know,” Anthony interjected, halfheartedly.“So, how can one of you battle while the other philosophizes?” she asked. “Those are two completely different things.”“Actually, they’re not,” I said. “Just different interpretations of the same experience.”“Yeah… Marc has had one too many adult beverages,” Anthony quickly intervened. “Sorry about that.”Then he directed me away from the girl and toward the other end of the bar. “I know you’re married, but I’m trying to make progress with the ladies tonight.  Don’t ever spew that philosophy crap again,” he said. “All it does is scare them away.”I looked back at the girl from the opposite end of the bar.  We made eye contact and she smiled and winked.All of Our LivesIn our daily lives, we share common experiences with friends, coworkers, lovers, and complete strangers we cross on the street.  But these experiences are rarely as similar as we expect them to be.A man and a woman may share a moment.  To her, it’s a gesture of romantic interest, but to him it’s just a friendly, intelligent conversation.  A mother may discipline her teenage son.  To the mother, it’s good parenting, but to her son, it’s oppression.  Two Web 2.0 startup founders may work tirelessly to design a new social networking platform.  To one, the project is about helping people communicate more effectively. To the other, it’s about breaking new technological ground.We all have different needs, different perspectives, and thus different means for understanding and describing our experiences.  This is why we rarely have the same exact interpretation of a shared experience.These differences are often cited as the reason relationships don’t work. “We just weren’t meant to be together,” a woman might say.  “My mom doesn’t understand,” a teenager might say.  “Our vision doesn’t seem to be compatible,” one startup founder might say about the other.But that’s just an easy out. And it’s oftentimes dead wrong.  Such differences can be precisely the reason relationships do work.If that woman wasn’t initially disappointed by that man, they probably wouldn’t be business partners and good friends today.  If that teenager wasn’t disciplined and nurtured by his mother, he may have decided to get into the car with his drunken friends the night they wrapped it around a telephone pole.  If one startup founder didn’t focus on technology and the other didn’t focus on people, their vision and their work would be far more limited.It’s important that we see things differently.  Because when our different visions eventually mesh together…Positive change transpires in all of our lives.Photo by: Carlo Nicora Why Our Search for Perfection Fails Us|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/search-for-perfection-fails.jpg?resize=475%2C318&ssl=1|This post has moved to HERE:How to Find the Perfect Man (or Woman)Photo by: Farfie 8 Simple Steps for Achieving Anything|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/8-basic-steps-success.jpg?resize=475%2C315&ssl=1|What is not started today is never finished tomorrow.– JW von GoetheYes, your goals are within reach.  In fact, achieving them is a simple process.  It just requires commitment and action on your behalf.Set your sights on a clear goal – What is it specifically that you want to achieve?  Write it down if you have to.Focus on one thing at a time and pick the next logical task – Ask yourself, “What can I do right now that will bring me one step closer to my desired goal?”Educate yourself – What knowledge and skills are required to complete the task you chose in step #2?  Keep it simple.  Everything else can be learned along the way.Start now – Why haven’t you started?  START!!!Say “NO” to distractions – Is the phone ringing?  Door knocking?  Dog barking?  Unless the house is burning to the ground, IGNORE IT ALL!!!Review and adjust – Are you making progress?  If yes, see the next step.  If not, why not?  Are there any small adjustments you need to make?Press on until the task is complete – Revisit steps #5 and #6 as required.Repeat – Once the task you chose in step #2 is complete, it’s time to repeat all the steps for the next logical task.  Revisit your goal in step #1 so it’s fresh in your mind, choose the next logical task, educate yourself as necessary, etc.Note:  For complex, long-term goals, I tackle one simple task every day.  Nothing more, nothing less.Also, I highly recommend these best selling productivity books:Eat That Frog!: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less TimeFocal Point: A Proven System to Simplify Your Life, Double Your Productivity, and Achieve All Your GoalsGetting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free ProductivityPhoto by: Zach Ancell 12 Multi-Function Items You Should Never Travel Without|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/12-tools-travel.jpg?resize=475%2C318&ssl=1|Whether you’re planning a four hour road trip or catching a flight to the other side of the world, you have limited space in your suitcase.  So pack these practical, space-saving, multi-function items and you’ll always be prepared without the hassle of lugging around additional gear.1.  Smart Phone with GPS – A smart phone is an information and communication portal that will likely save your rear end someday.  My smart phone has certainly saved mine a time or two.  Here are some of the basic functions of most modern smart phones:PhoneMaps and GPSInternet access (Google, email, etc.)CameraCan be used in the dark as a flashlightClock (with an alarm)CalculatorNote taking (voice recorder)Music and movie player (for entertainment)2.  Hand Sanitizing Wipes – In my mind, hand sanitizing wipes are essential tools that prevent me from infecting my body with germs on a daily basis.  They have several practical functions:Clean hands and other body partsDisinfect small cuts and scrapesClean various surfaces (public toilet seats, gas pumps, windshield, etc.)Remove small stains from clothing, upholstered furniture, etc.Remove makeup3.  Spare Wallet with Identification and Cash – Let’s recite the Boy Scout motto: “Always be prepared.”  If you lose your primary wallet when you’re hundreds of miles from home, it’s nice to have a back-up plan.  Find a safe, hidden place to stash your spare wallet when you arrive at your destination. While this isn’t a multi-function item in the traditional sense, it can save you so much grief when disaster strikes that it’ll seem like the most functional item in the world.  There are four things I keep in my spare wallet:$100 cashSpare photo identification$100 prepaid visaEmergency phone numbers (just in case I lose my phone too)4.  Credit Card Size Survival Tool – It’s the size of a credit card, made of rugged stainless steel, and has several practical functions including:Knife edgeScrewdriverRulerCan opener4 position wrenchButterfly screw wrenchSaw blade5.  Large Zip-Lock Bags – A large zip-lock bag has hundreds, if not thousands, of practical functions when you’re on the go:Keep leftovers freshKeep dry things dry when you’re around water (wallet, electronics, etc)Separate dirty, smelly clothes from clean clothes in your suitcaseLunchboxOrganize things like socks, toiletries, small electronics, etc.6.  Rubber Bands – Rubber bands are simple, functional and versatile.  There is an endless list of practical uses for a rubber band including:A simple wallet replacement – Just wrap a rubber band around your cash and cards and stick them in your pocket.Keep any wires or small objects in your suitcase organized and untangled.A bookmarkUse a rubber band to strap an injured finger to a firm stick or piece of cardboard until it can be properly casted. A safety strap for eye glasses7.  A Bottle of Water – Water is essential to life, so it’s probably a good idea to keep some with you wherever you go.  And similar to an empty zip-lock bag, water has hundreds, if not thousands, of practical uses:Drink it when you’re thirstyCleaning/rinsing agent (lots of possibilities here)Pour it into your rental car’s cooling system if it’s overheating.Put out a small fire (non grease or electrical).8.  Leatherman – It’s the all-in-one multi-tool you should never leave home without.  These little tools can handle a plethora of different jobs.  When traveling, I try to keep my Credit Card Size Survival Tool on me at all times (except in airplanes) and my Leatherman secured in my suitcase just in case I need it.  I personally own the Leatherman 830039 (linked above) and I love it.  Here are a few of it’s functions:Screw driverBit driverPliersWire cuttersKnifeScissorsWood/metal fileRuler9.  Multi-Use Car Charger – Because a cell phone with no battery juice is useless when your car breaks down on the side of the road during a long road trip.  My multi-use car charger (linked above) allows me to charge up to four devices at once.  This unit turns one auto cigarette lighter port into two, has two USB charging ports, and provides a heavy-duty 20 amp capacity.Charge your phoneCharge your cameraetc.10.  A Lighter and a Candle – It’s always a good idea to have the capability to create fire just in case you need it.  This one is simple:LightHeatCooking11.  Large Ace Bandage – Lots of practical uses including:Compression on a injured limbBandage for an open wound or burnTie things together ScarfMakeshift glove or grip12.  Small Roll of Duct Tape – Duct tape solves everything.  😉  If you’ve tried using duct tape and you’re still having problems, you just haven’t used enough of it.  Duct tape may very well be the second greatest invention after the hammer.  I’m not even going to attempt to summarize the extensive list of practical applications for duct tape.Do you think we left an essential item off of the list?  Let us know about it in the comments section below.Photo by: Pragmagraphr The Only Problem Standing in Our Way|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/problem-in-your-head.jpg?resize=475%2C274&ssl=1|This article has most to HERE:Should I forgive him?

Hassan What You Need To Know When Tragedy Strikes|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/tragedy-strikes.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1|The AccidentTragedy strikes a man who isn’t yet old.  A mini-van traveling toward him on a dark mountain highway hits his car nearly head-on just after sunset.  He grasps his steering wheel hard and veers into the rocky mountainside until his car screeches to a halt.  The mini-van flips onto its side and skids in the other direction off the cliff, plummeting 500 feet to the ground.  Inside is a young family of five.He doesn’t recall the events that followed during the next few days.  He doesn’t recall the three eye witnesses who comforted him and assured him that it wasn’t his fault – that the other driver had swerved into his lane.  He doesn’t recall how he got to the emergency room or the fact that he stayed there for five days to treat a concussion and a broken collar bone.The GuiltWhat he does know – and clearly recalls – are the endless string of days he passes sitting alone in his bedroom, crying, and thinking, “Why me?”  Why after forty-eight years of Sunday church attendance, unwavering faith, and regular community volunteering and charity, would God ask him to spend the rest of his life knowing that he singlehandedly killed an entire family?He has a loving, supporting family that tries to comfort his ailing heart, but he can only see them as the loving family he has taken from the world.  He also has an overflowing network of close friends who want to see him smile again, but they now represent friends that others have lost because of him.The man who isn’t yet old begins to age more rapidly.  Within a few short months, he is a shell of his former self – skin and bones, wrinkles creasing across his face, a despondent downward gaze, and a hole in his heart that has grown so wide he feels like there’s nothing left at all.All of the people around him – those family members and friends who care so much – have done everything in their power to revive him to his former self.  When love didn’t work, they tried relaxing vacations.  When vacations didn’t work, they tried getting him involved in community activities.  When the community activities didn’t work, they tried doctors.  And now they have resigned from trying.  Because the man who is now an old man has completely resigned from everything.The DreamA night comes when he decides that it’s just not worth it any more – that it’s time to leave this world behind.  Perhaps to go somewhere better.  Perhaps to go nowhere at all.  Luckily, he decides to sleep on it, because he barely has the strength to keep his eyelids open.  So he closes his eyes and instantly falls into a deep sleep.And he begins to dream.  In it, he is sitting in a dimly lit room at a round table across from an elderly woman who looks much like his late mother.  They stare at each other in silence for several minutes and then the elderly woman speaks.“My son, tragedy is simply a miracle waiting to be discovered.  Because within tragedy lie the seeds of love, learning, forgiveness, and empathy.  If we choose to plant these seeds, they grow strong.  If, on the other hand, we choose to overlook them, we prolong our tragedy and let somebody else to discover the miracle.”The old man cries in his dream and in his sleep.  He thinks about his wife, and his children, and all of the wonderful people who care for him.  And he suddenly realizes that instead of using the tragic accident to notice how precious life is, he has prolonged the tragedy and essentially ceased to live his life.  And he is very close, now, to passing all of his pain and sorrow over to the people he loves most in this world.A New BeginningHe opens his eyes and takes a deep breath.  He is alive.  He realizes that he still has an opportunity to change things…  To mend the broken pieces and experience the miracle that comes after the tragedy…  To plant the seeds of love, learning, forgiveness, and empathy, and water these seeds until they grow strong.He rolls over and kisses his wife on the cheek and ruffles her hair until her eyelids begin to flutter.  She opens her eyes and looks at him, totally confused.  There’s a spark in his eyes that she hasn’t seen in a long while – a spark that she thought had died with his youth on the day of the accident.  “I love you so much,” he says.  “I’ve missed you,” she replies.  “Welcome back.”Photo by: Bernardo Borghett 30 Ways to Save 30 Minutes a Day|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/30-ways-30-minutes.jpg?resize=500%2C327&ssl=1|We’re all way too busy.  We live and work in an age with infinite online and offline demands on our time and attention.  And the end result is that we’re left little free time for us to just breath and be.If you’re anything like me, you wish there were a few more minutes in every day.  Well the good news is there are always minutes to be saved and various ways to save them.  Save enough of them every day, and you’ll have a few extra hours at the end of the week.  In this article I discuss 30 of my favorite ways to save 30 minutes a day.Sometimes our days are so crammed with things to do that an extra 30 minutes at the end of the day represents the difference between sanity and insanity.  I use each of the tips below to save time and remain sane on a daily basis.Perhaps the very best question that you can memorize and repeat, over and over, is, “what is the most valuable use of my time right now?”– Brian TracyGroup similar tasks back-to-back. – Switching gears between different types of tasks can be tough.  It takes most people several minutes to get into a productive mental groove geared toward a speficic type of task.  Therefore, it makes sense to group similar tasks in an effort to minimize the number of rough patches, and thus wasted time, between task orders.Use productive shortcuts. – People who claim that there are no productive shortcuts in life have been brainwashed.  There are productive shortcuts for almost everything you do.  Finding and using them can save you a few minutes here and there on a daily basis.  If you use a computer, learn the keyboard shortcuts for the programs you use most often.  If you can permanently delegate one of your regular tasks to someone else, do it.  Is there a route to work with less traffic?  Where can you hit two birds with one stone?Eliminate all distractions for a set time. – Distractions  are everywhere.  They arrive via email, cell phone, coworker inquiry, etc.  I’ve found that cutting out all distractions for a set time is one of the most effective ways to get things done in less time.  You can’t remain in hiding forever, but you can be nearly four times as productive while you are.Narrow the number of ventures you’re involved in. – Productivity is not usually my challenge, narrowing the number of ventures to be productive in is.  Even when you have the knowledge and ability to access super-productive states, you get to a point where being simultaneously super-productive on too many fronts at once causes all activities to slow down, stand still and sometimes even slide backwards.Plan ahead and start early. – 10 minutes of dedicated time planning each evening will save you from 30 minutes of ad-hoc preparation each morning.  Likewise, starting your morning on purpose 30 minutes early will likely inject at least 60 additional productive minutes into your day.  Think about it.Organize your space. – How much time do you think the average person wastefully spends searching for items they’ve misplaced?  Keeping both your living and working spaces organized will undoubtedly save you 30 minutes daily.Productively use waiting time. – Waiting time does not have to be wasted time.  When you are waiting at the doctor’s office, the post office, or on hold for the next available representative, what simple tasks could you complete while you wait?  How about sorting through your snail mail, writing those thank you notes you’ve been putting off, reading the book you keep meaning to read, reviewing and editing your to-do lists, etc.Handle two minute tasks immediately. – “The 2 Minute Rule” is single greatest tip I picked up from David Allen’s book, “Getting Things Done.”  If you roughly estimate that a task is going to take you less than two minutes to accomplish, do it right now.  It’s a waste of time and energy to keep small tasks like this on your to-do list on in the back of your mind.Ask more questions. – The trial and error process can be a huge waste of time.  Often people view asking questions and relying on others as a weakness, but they are sadly mistaken.  Asking questions will bring you closer to the people around you and likely save you a huge chunk of time.  Win-win.Buy in bulk and cook in bulk. – Buying stuff and cooking food are two of the most common unplanned consumptions of time.  Most people buy replacements in small amounts only when they need them and think about food only when they’re hungry.  The problem is these issues will often arise at inopportune times.  The most efficient way I’ve found to counteract this is by doing bulk loads of both.  I know I’ll always need gas in my vehicle.  So instead of putting in $25 here and $25 there, I top off my tank every time I’m at the station regardless of the sticker shock.  Likewise, I know I’m going to be hungry at lunch time every day this week.  So on Sundays I’ll grill up five extra chicken breasts and make a chicken wrap or sandwich for every day of the week.Pick-up the phone. – We’ve become so accustomed to communicating digitally, sending emails, IMs and texts, etc. that we sometimes forget that we can get the same tasks accomplished in a fraction of the time with one or two quick phone calls.Don’t mindlessly browse online ad infinitum.  – Web browsing is one of the immense black holes in time spending.  Before you realize it, you may have spent hours browsing while generating very little value.Standardize common tasks. – If you find yourself performing the same set of tasks on a regular basis then it makes sense to establish an efficient, standardized way of accomplishing them.  Are certain tasks easier to perform in the morning?  Are there additional resources that can be utilized only at a certain time?  It’s up to you to find an efficient pattern, standardize it and follow it.Make better usage of commute times. – Listen to audio books, make calls, do some proactive time planning, etc.  I use Evernote on my iPhone and capture tons of ideas and thoughts when I’m commuting and traveling on business.Write things down. – Nobody’s memory is perfect.  If you don’t take notes and setup to-do lists for yourself you will end up wasting minutes of time trying to remember things that would have taken you seconds to write down.Consolidate all daily errands into one trip. – Consolidate all of your errands into one trip instead of driving back and forth several times from home to the store to home to the bank to home, etc.Stop overanalyzing things.  – There comes a time when you have to stop evaluating something and just bite the bullet and do it.  Contemplating taking action isn’t taking action.  It gets nothing accomplished.Exercise daily. – I know it sounds counter-intuitive.  You have to spend time exercising.  But, research has shown that exercise boosts cognitive function, creativity, problem solving and productivity.  In fact a NASA study showed employees who exercised daily worked at 100% efficiency after seven hours, while those who didn’t saw a 50% drop, meaning it took them twice as long to accomplish the same thing.Use a timer. – I use a timer to limit the amount of time I spend on daily tasks such as email, retuning calls, cranking through my to-do lists, etc.  This keeps me from getting overly distracted from the truly important tasks I must accomplish during the day.Do what you don’t want to do first. – If you do the tough tasks first when your mind is fresh, you’ll get them done quicker and be on to the next thing in no time.Harness the power of teamwork. – I heard a story once about some horses that were in a competition to see which could pull the most weight.  One horse pulled 3,000 lbs and another one pulled 4,000 lbs.  Someone suggested the horses team together to see how much they could pull.  Most guesses were in the 7,000 lb to 10,000 lb range but when those two horses worked together, they pulled an amazing 20,000 lbs.  That’s the power of teamwork.  Good teamwork can get a large project completed in an amazingly short amount of time.Just say NO!  – While saying yes can take us down some wonderful roads, there’s also a ton of value in saying “no.”  We’re only given a certain amount of hours in our lives; do you really want to give yours away so easily?  If you don’t have to time to commit to a new project, complete a favor, or serve on another committee, it’s a good idea to just say “no.”Focus your attention on one thing at a time.  – Cutting out multitasking (or “multi-slacking” as I call it) leaves you to focus more intently on one task and finish it to completion, rather than having many tasks started and nothing finished.Pare down your e-mail inbox. – As a first step, cancel any e-mail newsletter subscriptions that you do not read anymore.  If you subscribe to more than one newsletter in a certain category (e.g. tech newsletters), choose the one that delivers the most value to you on a daily basis and get rid of the rest.  The e-mail inbox should only be for priority communication, otherwise it just wastes your time.Use time multipliers. – Effective delegation of lower priority tasks is a time multiplier.  Eliminating time wasting activities is a time multiplier.  Screening phone calls can be a time multiplier.  By practicing creative procrastination on anything that doesn’t propel you toward your goals, you can multiply the amount of time you have to achieve those goals.Relocate closer to your place of employment. – In every major city in the world there are people traveling over an hour to reach their work destination from home.  This is a huge chunk of time that could be used far more productively.Turn off the TV. – Nuff said.Use technology to automate tasks. – From creating email filters, to automatically backing-up your hard drive, to automatic bill paying.  The more you can automate, the more time you’ll save.Keep it simple. – Keep your to-do lists and planning simple, and don’t waste time playing with new tools, etc.  There’s always going to be shiny programs that promise to make your day faster and more efficient.  Stick with one, and learn to rely on it.Spend minutes now to save hours later. – During happy hour last Friday I spent some time listening to one of my colleagues confess her utter distaste for the Windows 7 Start menu.  “The system is organized all wrong.  The programs I need are buried and the ones I never use are right at my finger tips.  I waste so much time digging through menus,” she said.  “But you can easily rearrange that,” I replied.  She looked down with a despondent expression on her face.  “I know,” she said.  “Someone else told me that too, but I haven’t taken the time to figure it out.”  Bottom line:  Sometimes you have to spend a few minutes now to save hours of grief in the future.What did I leave off the list?  Please share your favorite time saving

Results A Bedtime Memory Building Exercise|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/bedtime-mind-hack.jpg?resize=500%2C369&ssl=1|If knowledge is power and your mind is the container of this knowledge, then the more you improve your mind’s memory capacity, the more knowledge your mind will retain and the more power you will have at your disposal.  At least that’s what I keep telling myself.  😉Anyway, over the last six months I have been practicing a particular bedtime memory building exercise every night before I fall asleep.  And it’s really been working wonders for me.  In this short time, I’ve noticed that I’m now able to remember smaller moments in my days, and instantly recollect details from these moments that I used to completely forget.In a nutshell, here’s the memory building exercise:Every night, as you’re lying in bed ready to fall asleep, review what you did during the day from start to finish in as much detail as you can possibly remember.  Start with the exact moment you woke up and got out of bed and finish with the moment that just passed as you laid back down in your bed.  Visualize every single detail in your mind, each and every step you took in sequential order from beginning to end as if you were watching a video recap of your day.The first few times you do this, you may be surprised with how few details you can remember.  You’ll likely jump quickly through your recollection of the day from one major event or block of time to the next without recalling any of the meticulous details from the smaller moments contained within those larger time blocks.But after just a few short weeks of practicing this exercise, you’ll notice an obvious improvement in your memory and you’ll gradually get better and better recalling even the minutest details from your day.  Your goal should be to grow your memory to the point where you can visualize the particulars present in every scene of every waking moment over the course of the day – the conversations you had, the people who were present at the time, the song that was playing on the radio, the billboards and people you saw when you were walking or driving home, etc.And although I usually fall asleep long before I completely recap my day (this is totally normal), after six months of routinely practicing this memory building exercise, I have noticed the following benefits:My memory has improved, especially my ability to recollect the minute details present in various situations over the course of a day, week, month, or longer period of time.I’m living more in the moment.  I’m now more observant and aware of how I’m spending my time when I’m actually doing things throughout the day.  I assume this is because I’m subconsciously trying to remember the events that I will eventually recap later on before bedtime.I’m more keenly focused on the task at hand.  I now absorb myself more in everything I do so I can extract the details and fully recollect the moment.  This has helped me narrow my focus and concentrate when I’m tackling difficult tasks.Outside of recapping my day every night, I have improved my ability visualize other aspects of my life as well.  Future goals, past milestones, to-do’s, tasks at hand, etc.I also seem to fall asleep more easily.  Often in the middle of recapping my day, I peacefully doze off into a deep slumber.  I assume this is because recapping the details of the day is kind of like counting sheep as they jump over the moon.So give this bedtime memory building exercise a try.  It’s simple, relaxing, mentally stimulating, and seriously thought-provoking.Photo by: Jah "

Money can buy options – the option to do what you want to do instead of what you have to do.  Money is great to have as long as you manage and spend it wisely.  But most of us never do – we waste it and we don’t even realize it.How?  Why?Because many of the items and services we buy aren’t worth what we pay for them.Here are 18 common money wasters to beware of:Bottled Water – Water is one of the most abundant, freely available resources on planet Earth.  So is air.  If I bottled some air, would you pay 2 to 3 dollars a bottle for it?  I doubt it.  Bottom line:  Buy a water filter for your tap and stop wasting your money.Magazine and Newspaper Subscriptions – The same exact articles are online for free.  I can read them right now and I didn’t pay a dime.  Why are you?Printer Ink Cartridges – If you’re buying brand new ink cartridges every time you need new ink for your printer you’re paying about $8000 a gallon for ink.  Yep, that’s right!  Computer printer ink is one of the most overpriced consumer goods.  For home users, instead of buying new ink cartridges, take your old ones to a store that will refill them for half the price.  For businesses that do lots of printing, consider outsourcing the bulk of your printing.More House Than You Need – When you buy or rent a house that’s bigger than you need, you end up wasting lots of money on larger monthly payments, higher upkeep costs, higher utility bills, and lots of random ‘stuff’ to fill up the extra empty space.Insurance – Car insurance, homeowner’s insurance, title insurance, etc.  Insurance companies love to rip us off.  And while you can’t totally avoid them from a legal standpoint, you can shop around and save yourself a boat-load of cash.  Don’t get comfortable paying what you’re paying simply because you’re used to it.  Make sure you’re getting the best deal.Premium Cable or Satellite Television – Hulu.com offers thousands of television shows and full-length movies – all for free.  And Netflix charges $9 a month for access to hundreds of thousands of television episodes and movies on DVD, or you can stream them live to your computer.  So if you’re paying more than $9 a month, you’re wasting your money.Retail Furniture – Most people don’t realize that home furniture has a 200% to 400% markup on it.  A typical retail furniture store must maintain warehouse inventory, a showroom, commission salesmen, etc. which all equates to a fairly high overhead.  For this reason it is normal for furniture retailers to maintain extremely high markups.  A typical piece of furniture that has a ‘suggested retail price’ of $500 will usually cost the retailer less than $200, so even when they put it ‘on sale’ for $400, they’re still making over 100% profit.  The best way to save big money on furniture is to buy from an online furniture store with low overhead, buy wholesale, or buy slightly used on eBay or craigslist.Restaurants and Prepared Foods – I don’t need to tell you this.  Eating out is ridiculously expensive.  So is buying prepared foods at the grocery store.  Buy both every once in awhile as a treat, but learn to cook and prepare your own food on a regular basis.  It’s not just cheaper, it’s healthier too.Nutritional Supplements – Protein powders, vitamins, sports drinks, etc. – all of them are overpriced and have been proven by doctors to be mediocre sources of nourishment.  The answer to good health rests not in a once or twice a day supplement solution, but in an integrated approach to good baseline nutrition though healthy eating habits that give us the energy we need to enjoy our lives and the best chance of warding off illnesses.Luxury Name Brand Products – A car gets you from point ‘A’ to point ‘B.’  A purse holds your personal belongings.  A pair of sunglasses shades your eyes from the sun.  A shirt keeps you warm.  If you’re paying premium prices just to get a fashionable brand name labeled on each these products without any regard for how efficiently the products actually serve their practical purpose, you’re wasting your money.New Cars – See my previous point.  A car is a means of transportation to get you from one place to another.  If you’re buying a new car every few years even when your old car works perfectly fine, you’re likely trying too hard to impress the wrong people… and you’re going broke in the process.Electronics Warranties – When you buy new electronics a warranty might seem like a decent thing to invest in.  After all, a warranty covers everything from technical problems to spilling soda on the circuits.  But don’t be fooled.  Most of the time the numbers just don’t make sense.  For instance, a two-year extended warranty on a $400 laptop at Best Buy will cost you upwards of $280 – that’s about 70% of the original price.  You’re better off saving your money and taking your chances.Retail Computer Software – Most retail computer software is marked way up.  You can easily find OEM copies of the exact same software online (on eBay and similar sites) for 25% – 50% less.  Also, look into free open source software alternatives.  For instance, Microsoft Office Professional 2010 costs $300 at Best Buy, but you can download OpenOffice.org’s professional office suite which has all the same word processing, spreadsheet, etc. capabilities for free.  And OpenOffice.org is 100% compatible with Microsoft Office files.Medical Issues that Can Be Avoided – Eat right and exercise regularly!  Keep your body and mind healthy!  Major medical problems drain back accounts, increase insurance rates, keep you from working and earning money, and generally guarantee that you will have long-term financial problems.Prescription Medication – The previous bullet leads directly into this one.  Prescription medicine has one of the highest markups of any consumer good. The sky high cost of prescription medications is crippling parts of the US economy and keeping necessary medicines out of the hands of those who need it most – people living on fixed incomes with acute or chronic health issues.  Unlike other countries, there are no price controls on prescription medications here in the US.  So we end up paying 200% – 5000% markups on essential medicines and drugs such as Prozac and Xanax.  The solution is to buy wholesale at wholesale resellers such as Costco.  Costco’s prices are typically half the cost of the local retail pharmacy on many popular prescription medications.Jewelry and Precious Gems – All jewelry is subject to volatile changes in price and high markups.  The industry average markup varies widely – 100% to up to over 1000%.  And jewelers thrive on the uneducated buyer, so do your research.  Also, jewelry is almost always an emotional purchase, so you need to think logically about what you’re getting, how much you’re paying for it, and what your other options are.  And even then, you probably won’t get a great deal.  Buying and wearing less jewelry is always the smartest choice.Second-rate Entertainment – The best things in life are free.  Stop wasting your money on movies, games, and other second-rate entertainment and take a good look around you.  Mother Nature offers lots of entertainment free of charge.  Go hiking, go skinny dipping, play in the rain, build a bonfire with your friends, watch the sunset with your lover, etc.Nasty Money-sucking (and life-sucking) Habits. – Smoking, drinking and gambling are all perfect examples of bad habits in which you choose to trade short term pleasure for long term debt and discomfort.  So light one up, shoot one down, and toss another chip across the table.  It’s only your life and livelihood.Photo by: Tracy O. How To Love|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/how-to-love.jpg?resize=500%2C341&ssl=1|More People Like HimYou’d like Jaydee a lot.  Most people do.  He’s the kind of guy who listens when you talk, who smiles often, and who says things that make the people around him smile.  He’s intelligent, but in a way that makes others feel comfortable.  It’s the way he expresses himself in simple terms that you can understand – almost like he’s articulating the thoughts you already have in your head, but haven’t yet found the right words to say aloud.It doesn’t matter who you are either.  Jaydee always has a way of relating to you.  Because, in a way, he’s been there with you all along.  He can think like you, so he understands you.  So many of us have limitations in our perceptions.  We understand the soldiers but not the politics governing the war.  We understand the people who go to the movies but not the ones who attend NASCAR races.  But somehow Jaydee gets all of us.  It’s his gift.If he hasn’t actually been to the NASCAR race you’re talking about, he’ll be honest about it – but he’ll make you feel as if he was right there with you.  And once you return home after spending a night with Jaydee, you’ll catch yourself smiling and thinking that there needs to be more people like him in the world.  Because if there were, there would be far less to worry about.Jaydee passed away today.  I don’t really want to discuss the details, because honestly they aren’t relevant.  It could have been a car accident.  It could have been old age.  We are often far too concerned with how people died, rather than how they lived.  And I want you to know how he lived.  He told stories – lots of stories that contained subtle insights and wisdom about our lives and the world around us.  And today, I want to share with you the last story he told me before he died:His Last StoryOne Sunday morning when I was a little boy my father surprised me and took me to the fishing docks.  But instead of fishing, like all the other little boys and girls were doing with their fathers, we sat down on the end of one of the docks and watched all the other children fish.  For hours, we sat there and watched until we left without ever casting a single fishing line into the water.I was simultaneously sad and angry.  On the drive home I told my father that I’d never forgive him for being so cruel to me.  He looked at me, smiled and said, “I love you, Jaydee.”  When I didn’t respond, he asked, “Did you notice how happy all the other little boys and girls were?  Did you see their smiles?  Could you feel the happiness in their hearts?”   After a moment of silence I quickly snapped, “I don’t really care!  I just want to go fishing like everyone else!”  My father sighed and kept driving.We went back to the fishing docks dozens of Sunday mornings throughout my childhood.  And each time we saw hundreds of other little boys and girls jumping and laughing and celebrating as they reeled in fish.  But we still never cast a single fishing line into the water.  We just sat in there on the end of that same dock and watched.  And my father never explained why.  But he didn’t need to.  Because years later, as I entered adulthood, I suddenly realized that those mornings we spent sitting on that dock was where I learned how to love.Photo by: Yasin Hasan 10 Lies You Will Hear Before You Pursue Your Dreams|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/lies-pursue-your-dreams.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1|Unfortunately, just before you take your first step on the righteous journey to pursue your dreams, people around you, even the ones who deeply care for you, will give you awful advice.  It’s not because they have evil intentions.  It’s because they don’t understand the big picture – what your dreams, passions, and life goals mean to you.  They don’t understand that, to you, the reward is worth the risk.So they try to protect you by shielding you from the possibility of failure, which, in effect, also shields you from the possibility of making your dreams a reality.As our friend Steve Jobs says:“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.  Don’t be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people’s thinking.  Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice, heart and intuition.  They somehow already know what you truly want to become.  Everything else is secondary.”Here are 10 ill-advised tips (lies) people will likely tell you when you decide to pursue your dreams, and why they are dreadfully mistaken.You can follow your dreams someday, but right now you need to buckle down and be responsible. – Someday?  When is ‘someday?’  Someday is not a day at all.  It’s a foggy generalization of a time that will likely never come.  Today is the only day guaranteed to you.  Today is the only day you can begin to make a difference in your life.  And pursuing your dreams is what life is all about.  So don’t be irresponsible.  Don’t wait until ‘someday.’  Make today the first day of the rest of your new life.You’re totally screwed if it doesn’t work out. – Wrong!  This is a giant, lame load of BS.  You’re not even close to being screwed.  In fact, the worst case scenario is that things don’t work out and you have to go back to doing exactly what you are doing right now.It’s safer to stay at your day job. – Sure, I suppose.  But you know what’s even safer than that?  Going home, locking yourself in your bedroom, and never, ever coming out.  And just like that you will have flushed your entire life and your dreams down the toilet.  Remember, safer doesn’t always mean better.That’s impossible! – It’s only impossible if you never do anything about it.  The reason certain things seem impossible is simply because nobody has achieved them yet.  But this doesn’t mean that with your help these things won’t become possible in the future.  If you truly dedicate yourself to an end result, almost anything is possible.  You just have to want it bad enough.Only a lucky few “make it.” – That’s because those lucky few got off their rear ends and did something about it!  They had the drive, determination, and willpower that you have right now.  You can be one of them.  It’s up to you, and only you.You might fail.  And failing is bad. – Failures are simply stepping stones to success.  No matter how it turns out, it always ends up just the way it should be.  Either you succeed or you learn something.  Win-Win.  The biggest mistake you can make is doing nothing because you’re too scared to make a mistake.  If you can’t handle failure, then you can’t handle success either.You don’t have access to the right resources. – It’s not about having the right resources; it’s about exploiting the resources you do have access to.  Stevie Wonder couldn’t see, so he exploited his sense of hearing into a passion for music, and he now has 25 Grammy Awards to prove it.  Get it?You need more money saved before you can take the first step. – You don’t need more money.  You need a plan.  You need a budget.  Eliminate ALL the nonessential costs in your life.  If pursuing your dream requires you to leave your day job, figure out the absolute minimum amount of income that you require to realistically live.  Studying those who have succeeded with similar ventures also helps.  But above all, take baby steps.  Don’t be foolish and assume that you must have a certain amount of money saved right now, or that you must quit your day job today in order to pursue your dreams.  Instead, ask yourself, “What actions can I take right now with the money and resources I have right now that will bring me closer to desired goal?”You don’t need any help.  It’s smarter to go after it alone. – You are the sum of the people you spend the most time with.  If you hang with the wrong people, they will negatively affect you.  But if you hang with the right people, you will be far more capable and powerful than you ever could have been alone.  Find your tribe and work together to make a difference in all of your lives.That sounds like a lot of hard work. – You’re darn right it does!  But that doesn’t mean it’s not worth it.  I think success in life hinges on one key point: Finding hard work you love doing.  As long as you remain true to yourself and follow your own interests, values and dreams, you can find success through passion.  Perhaps most importantly, you won’t wake up a few years from now working in a career field you despise, wondering “How the heck am I going to do this for the next 30 years?”  So if you catch yourself working hard and loving every minute of it, don’t stop.  You’re on to something big.  Because hard work ain’t hard when you concentrate on your passions and dreams.Disregard these misguided bits of nonsense and you’ll be well on your way to fulfilling your dreams.Now get out there and make a splash!Photo by: Gigi

People’|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/how-to-build-your-tribe.jpg?resize=500%2C392&ssl=1|This is a guest post by Marelisa of Abundance Blog at Marelisa Online.One of the most fundamental human needs is the need to belong.  Noted psychologist, Abraham Maslow, identified it as one of the five basic needs.  We want to be part of a group and to feel loved and accepted by others.  That is, we want to be a member of a tribe.  A tribe-or a pack, clan, elected family, posse, crew, network, or true friends–is a group of people who share common interests and values and show genuine appreciation and care for each other.Your tribe members are those people who accept you just as you are, and who want the very best for you.  They make you feel understood, and they encourage you to go after your goals and pursue your dreams.  Also, the members of your tribe help you to get through difficult times, and they provide you with a sense of community and support.To paraphrase Sam Adams–from the Onion A.V. Club–, your tribe are those people you love to cruise the streets with while listening to the Ramones and playing air guitar, and who, at the same time, will come and slap you when you’re acting out of line.  Your tribe is made up of ‘your people.’  Think of the six main characters in the hit series “Friends,” and how they were always there for each other.Sir Ken Robinson–author of “The Element,” a book on how to find work that you’re passionate about–argues that your tribe is essential in helping you to find your element.  Members of a tribe kick ideas around with each other and validate each other.  Also, tribe members drive each other to explore the real extent of their talents.  In addition, Robinson argues that when a group of people with common interests come together, a synergy is created which allows them to create something much greater than any of them could have created individually.If you feel tribe-less, rest assured in the knowledge that your tribe is out there.  In addition, if you’re already surrounded by a supportive tribe, remember that there are probably many members of your tribe that you have not met yet.  Below you’ll find twelve valuable tips and insights to help you find your tribe-if you haven’t found it already–, or to help you expand your tribe-if you already have one.Twelve Tips for Finding or Expanding Your TribeAmerican journalist and writer Jane Howard is credited with the following quote: “Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family.  Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one.”  Here are twelve tips for finding or expanding your tribe:Think of the qualities you want your tribe members to have.  As an illustration, you may want each of your tribe members to have the following qualities: treats people with respect; listens but doesn’t judge; has a quirky sense of humor; is an artist; lives with passion; doesn’t sweat the small stuff; is loyal and trustworthy.Decide if there’s a particular type of activity that you want to engage in with your tribe, such as starting a book club, taking hiking trips, going to happy hour, or visiting museums and gallery openings.Listen to your inner voice and trust your instincts.  When was the last time you had a gut feeling about someone?  Sometimes you’ll meet someone new and you’ll feel drawn to them right away, almost as if you were old friends.  Other times you’ll come across people who immediately make you want to put up your guard.  Pay attention to your gut reaction to others.One way to find your tribe is to use Social Media to create a virtual tribe; you can then look for ways to meet in the offline world.  For example, Twitter allows you to search for people who share your interests and who actively talk about these interests.  Use the topics and activities that you’re interested in as key terms.  You can also enter the city where you live as a key term in order to find others who share your interests and live in your area.Start a blog on a subject that interests you–such as breeding bull terriers, chasing UFOs, Russian 19th century novelists, and so on–and create your own community.  If you can get together a group of bloggers who are like -minded and live in the same city, you can host a blog meet-up so you can all meet in person.Look for upcoming community events in your city that are centered around activities you enjoy.Search for Yahoo groups and forums which cater to a particular topic that you’re passionate about.If there are one or two people you already know who you would like to strengthen your friendship with, try to find a way to work together.  You could plant a communal garden together, or meet once a week to complete unfinished projects–such as crafts, sewing, knitting, or woodworking– as a group.  Working with others can help you strengthen your bonds with them.Marketing guru Seth Godin advices that you create your tribe by helping others to achieve their goals.  Connect people in your social network who have common interests; give them access to information and resources that they need; and let them know that you’re available if they need help.Andy Paige–a stylist on TLC– explains that you need to look for your 1/3.  To summarize: Andy argues that 1/3 of the people you come across will dislike you; 1/3 of the people you meet will be indifferent toward you; and 1/3 of the people you come into contact with will love you.  You’re looking for that that last 1/3.  Those are your people.  Don’t worry about the other 2/3.Create rituals that you can share with your tribe, such as having regular meals together.  You can also have in-jokes and slang or jargon that’s unique to your tribe.  Look for ways to make your group cohere and know that it’s a group.Keep in mind that the people you hang out with will have a huge impact on every aspect of your life, from your level of income—several financial authors argue that your income is equal to the income of your five best friends–, to your level of happiness—studies show that happiness is contagious.  In addition, we have a subconscious tendency to model the behavior of those around us.  Choose your tribe wisely.ConclusionThe members of your tribe are your allies on your life journey.  When you’re creating or expanding your tribe, look for people who will lift you up, help you grow, recharge you, inspire you, and celebrate with you, and who are willing to lend a hand when you need it.  In addition, always remember that as a tribe member you have responsibilities toward your tribe.  You need to give back to the tribe and offer other tribe members your support, just as they support you.  Now get out there and start creating or expanding your tribe.Marelisa Fábrega blogs about creativity, productivity, and simply getting the most out of life over at Abundance Blog at Marelisa Online.  Marelisa is the author of the eBooks How to Be More Creative – A Handbook for Alchemists,  and How To Live Your Best Life – The Essential Guide for Creating and Achieving Your Life List.Photo by: Frabuleuse "
"7 Zen Habits of Highly Efficient Minds|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/7-zen-habits.jpg?resize=500%2C317&ssl=1|Zen habits are simple lifestyle habits that have the potential to radically alter the efficiency of our minds and the potential of our lives.  We can easily integrate these habits into our daily routines to keep our minds sharp and efficient for years to come.  Here are seven ways to keep a great head on your shoulders:First we form habits, then they form us.– Rob Gilbert1.  Challenge your mind with new activities, skills and information.The primary function of the human mind is its ability to absorb information and adapt to challenging unfamiliar environments.  Do you remember the old saying ‘use it or lose it?’  Nothing could be closer to the truth.  If you don’t use your mind, you will lose your mind.  So broaden your horizons, learn new skills and challenge your mind every single day.2.  Your mind is part of your body.  Fuel, exercise and rest your body properly.The human brain accounts for roughly 2% of the total mass of the human body, yet it consumes over 20% of the oxygen and nutrients the human body intakes.  Therefore, it makes sense to fuel your body with healthy food and keep your blood oxygen levels high with regular exercise.  Also, a tired mind is rarely productive, so get yourself enough sleep every night.  For a practical guide on maintaining a healthy, fit body I recommend The 4-Hour Body.3.  Pay attention now.  Concentrate on the present.People often obsess themselves with the past and the future.  But life is happening right now.  You can’t learn something or remember something that’s happening now if your mind is stuck in another time.It takes about eight seconds of intense focus to process a new piece of information into your long-term memory.  So don’t let your life and your mind slip away.  Instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, practice being and living in the present moment.  Remember, right now is the only moment guaranteed to you.  Right now is life.  Don’t miss it.  The Power of Now is a brilliant resource on this topic.4.  If something requires your attention in the future, write it down in a trusted location.The more miscellaneous commitments you try to juggle in your mind, the less efficient your mind becomes.  There’s absolutely no reason to memorize to-do lists, general reminders and most supplemental information.  That’s a huge waste of brainpower that could be spent more wisely on learning something new (see bullet #1).  So put your mind at ease by writing down these bits of information in a trusted location that can be easily accessed in the future.5.  Rehearse information frequently – ‘over-learn.’In a nutshell, over-learning is the continued practice of material or skills long after the material or skills have been mastered.  The primary goal is information retention – to practice something until it becomes second nature to you, like an automatic function of who you are.Over-learning is frequently used by people who make public speeches or those who must perform certain functions on the spot with little support or external assistance.  For example, a concert pianist doesn’t stop learning a piece of music she will perform once she initially masters it.  She keeps practicing it so that it’s automatic and there’s little possibility of forgetting it when she performs in front of a large audience.You can easily apply the concept of over-learning in your own life by reviewing what you’ve learned the same day you learn it and at regular intervals thereafter – something researchers call ‘spaced rehearsal.’  And once you over-learn whatever it is you’re studying, you’ll always be prepared to employ the information or skill at a moment’s notice.6.  Develop and nurture long-lasting, stimulating relationships.Human beings are social creatures.  Regular interaction with close friends and family is regarded by most mental health professionals as the number one source of happiness in a human being’s life.  When the human mind is happy, it is less stressed.  And a less stressed mind is a more efficient mind.7.  Be motivated, keep a positive attitude and find something to smile about.Each one of the six points above has the ability to make your mind more efficient (and change your life).  But when you combine them with positive thinking their beneficial effects increase exponentially.Positive thinking is at the forefront of every great success story.  The mind must believe it can do something before it is capable of actually doing it.  So be aware of your mental self-talk.  We all talk silently to ourselves in our heads, but we aren’t always conscious of what we’re saying or how it’s affecting us.  Start listening to your thoughts.  If you hear negative thoughts, stop for a second and replace them with positive thoughts.As the Dalai Lama once said, “The way to overcome negative thoughts and destructive emotions is to develop opposing, positive emotions that are stronger and more powerful.”  For some practical positive thinking guidance, I recommend reading The Power of Positive Thinking.Final ThoughtsNow remember, what counts the most is not what you learned by reading this article (or any article for that matter), but how you apply this knowledge.  You must take action.  So start small, but start now.Choose one of the seven bullet points above that speaks to you the loudest and practice it for a few minutes today, tomorrow and every day for the next several months.  Eventually, one day, without even thinking about it you’ll start doing it automatically.  And you’ll suddenly realize that these short practice sessions have evolved into a permanent, internalized, zen habit.Photo by: Epi Longo 10 Surefire Ways To Live Below Your Full Potential|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/below-full-potential.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1|This guest post was written by Celes Chua. Do you know that most people never utilize more than 0.1% of their true potential in their lifetime?It’s true.  The thing is, human potential is unlimited.  Unlike computers, you’ll never come across a situation where your brain says the hard drive is full.  You can constantly push your limits, reaching greater heights, only to find that you’re not even reaching a fraction of your true worth!  Believe it or not, you harness more power than you can ever imagine.Unfortunately, many do not utilize their true potential, and lay it to waste by engaging in tasks that are a poor use of their time and energy.  Here are 10 sure-fire ways to live below your true potential:1.  Harp on the past instead of focusing on the present.Some people spend their lives living in the past.  They lament about what has been, what they could have done, and why they didn’t do that.  However, the past is the past, and no matter how much time we spend thinking and lamenting about it, it doesn’t change anything.  To spend time moping about what has been is to waste the person you can be.There were times in the past when I wondered how things would have been if I did X instead of Y.  Or if I did Z instead of Y.  However, after that I’d ask myself, “How would this change anything?”  Me sitting here and thinking about the past does absolutely nothing to change things and improve my life.  Instead, it is only by thinking forward and taking action that I’m able to live a truly fulfilling life.What kind of future do you want to create?  What actions can you take to create this ideal future?  What have you learned from the past that will help you in this journey?  Asking and acting on questions like these will help you to maximize your present moment so you can live your best life going forward.  For some practical guidance on living in the present, I recommend The Power of Now.2.  Get caught up in the details vs. the big picture.If you’re a perfectionist, you might find yourself caught up with perfecting details on a regular basis.  If so, you’re not alone – I’m the same way.  I spend a lot of time editing the nitty-gritty, so that everything can be perfect and the way I envision it to be.  For example in my articles, I can spend an hour or more looking for the perfect photo that expresses the exact intention of my article.  I can spend hours just improving my blog and forums so that my readers can get the perfect experience.However, I have come to realize that by spending all my time on the details, I’m not making the best use of my time.  According to the 80/20 principle, 80% of the results we can achieve comes from 20% of our actions.  In trying to achieve the remaining 20% to get the perfect 100% outcome, we have to spend 80% more effort!Some of us may think that we should do everything to achieve the best outcome.  While I agree with this, it fails to hold true outside of certain situational contexts.  For example, while it may be gratifying to get the best picture for each blog article, the extra time spent looking for that best picture prevents me from working on higher value tasks, such as writing new books or creating new challenges for my readers.  It goes without saying that one hour spent on the latter adds more value than one hour spent looking for a picture.By looking at the big picture, it helps you realize what does matter and what doesn’t so that you can then channel your energy accordingly.  The Gifts of Imperfection is a good read on this topic.3.  Let yourself be affected by minor issues.Sometimes we may be affected by a hurtful comment or discouraged by a small setback.  While these emotions are justified, often times these events are insignificant in the long run.  One way to check if something is worth mulling over is to ask yourself this question: “Will this matter in one year’s time?  Three years?  5 years?  10 years?  30  years?”  If not, then it’s probably not worth your energy to think about these things.  Concentrate on things that do matter in the long run instead.4.  Blame others for your plight.Is there anything you’re blaming others for in your life?  Are you blaming the economy for not getting the job you want?  Your parents for giving you “fat” genes?  Your boss for your workload?  The world for lack of opportunities around you?  The universe for not giving you the life of your dreams?The extent to which you can live your dream life depends on the extent to which you take responsibility for your life.  When you blame someone/something for what you’re going through, you deny responsibility.  You give others power over that part of your life.  For example, if you blame your parents for your obesity, you’ll continue to remain obese because in your mind they are the reason why you’re obese.  You’ll never have the power to change the situation until you take responsibility for it.  When you take 100% responsibility for your life, be it your career status, your health, your relationship status, your finances, your friendships, etc, that’s when you’re set to achieve the life of your dreams.5.  Complain.It’s okay to complain once in a while as a way to vent, but doing it too often makes you a magnet for negativity.  Whenever you complain, you give your power away to the universe.  For every second you spend complaining, that’s one second you could have spent creating the life you want.  Rather than lament, think about the actions you can take to improve your situation instead.  Every time you do, that’s one step toward the life you’ve been dreaming about.6.  Try to do everything by yourself.Are you someone who likes to do everything yourself?  So do I – but over the years I realize that this prevents me from achieving more.  In trying to do everything, including the nitty-gritty, less important details (see #2), that means you’re not able to do the higher level, important things like your biggest goals and dreams.  Start by delegating, outsourcing or removing the less important tasks and scaling yourself up to do the more important ones.  You’ll notice a big difference in your productivity.7.  Set small goals.Many people set small goals because they’re afraid to fail.  Actually what they’re really afraid of is to realize that they’ve always had all the power to achieve everything they want and that they have wasted their own time and dreams.  You have all the potential and power in this world to achieve everything you want.  Stop settling for less and set your highest goals today.  You owe it to yourself.8.  Bottle up unhappiness.Bottling up your emotions is like creating a bomb that will eventually self-implode.  Every time you bury an emotion, you’re weighing yourself down with baggage.  The best way to deal with your emotions, whether happy ones or unhappy ones, is to lay them out on the table and face them.  Don’t hide from your problems.  When you do you’re just hiding from yourself.  I found a great way to clear emotional baggage is to use the brain dumping exercise, where you dump your emotions in a journal for about 10-15 minutes.  Try it – you’ll feel lighter almost immediately.9.  Think that you cannot do it.As Henry Ford put it, “Whether you think you can or think you can’t – you are right.”  There is nothing more powerful in the world than our beliefs.  Our beliefs are the lenses we use to see the world.  If we think we don’t have the power, then our minds will find the evidence to support that thought.  If we think we have the power to achieve what we want, then similarly, our minds will automatically lock down on all the evidence that supports that thought.Our limitations have little to do with the world, society, people, or anything like that – our limitations have always been within us – our beliefs.  My personal motto is that as long as there’s the will, there’s always a way.  Nothing is impossible to achieve in this world.  For some practical positive thinking guidance, I recommend The Magic of Thinking Big.10.  Procrastinate on your goals.Procrastination is the best way to bury your potential.  Do you want your goals to never come true?  Sure, procrastinate on them.  I’ve never in my life seen a happy procrastinator.  Everyone I know who procrastinates usually holds a heavy heart, because deep down they want to achieve their goals.  Deep down they know they are meant to live their dreams.  So stop procrastinating.  Start by first identifying what you’re passionate about, then go from there.  As long as you’re doing what you love, you can never go wrong.Be sure to check out my past guest posts on Marc and Angel:How To Be The Best You Can Be – 10 Important Steps30 Ways To Live a Life of ExcellenceAbout the author: Celes writes

HarrisEverything I do is by choice.  There is always another option.I will strive to be the best I can be, but I will never try to be someone I’m not.I must keep dreaming.  Wanting what I don’t think

just the way they are.I cannot make someone love me.  I can only be someone who can be loved.The biggest mistake I can make is doing nothing because I’m scared to make a mistake.Nothing is good or bad, but thinking makes it so.What other people think of me isn’t that important.If I want to believe in myself more I will start doubting others less.  Because where I most easily doubt others is

of others.I will treat everyone with the same level of respect I would give to my grandfather and the same level of patience I would have with my baby brother.Nothing is permanent.  However good or bad a situation is now, it will change.Life is short and people are not perfect.  I will forgive myself.  I will forgive others.Missing a once-in-a-lifetime chance leads to regret, or creativity.

jealously.  I’m in competition with one person and one person only – myself.  I’m competing to be the best I can be.Please feel free to edit this list to meet your own needs.  I’ve made a few

kay 10 Simple Truths Smart People Forget|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/simple-truths-smart-people.jpg?resize=500%2C361&ssl=1|Some of the smartest people I know continuously struggle to get ahead because they forget to address a few simple truths that collectively govern our potential to make progress.  So here’s a quick reminder:#1 – Education and intelligence accomplish nothing without action.It doesn’t matter if you have a genius IQ and a PhD in Quantum Physics, you can’t change anything or make any sort of real-world progress without taking action.  There’s a huge difference between knowing how to do something and actually doing it.  Knowledge and intelligence are both useless without action.  It’s as simple as that.  For some practical guidance on taking action, I highly recommend The Now Habit.#2 – Happiness and success are two different things.I know an extremely savvy businesswoman who made almost a million dollars online last year. Every entrepreneur I know considers her to be wildly successful.  But guess what?  A few days ago, out of the blue, she told me that she’s depressed.  Why?  “I’m burnt out and lonely.  I just haven’t taken enough time for myself lately,” she said.  “Wow!” I thought.  “One of the most successful people I know isn’t happy.”I also know a surfer who surfs almost all day, every day on the beach in front of our condo complex in San Diego.  He’s one of the most lighthearted, optimistic guys I’ve ever met – always smiling from ear to ear.  But he sleeps in a van he co-owns with another surfer and they both frequently panhandle tourists for money.  So while I can’t deny that this man seems happy, I wouldn’t classify his life as a success story.“What will make me happy?” and “What will make me successful?” are two of the most important questions you can ask yourself.  But they are two different questions.#3 – Everyone runs their own business.No matter how you make a living or who you think you work for, you only work for one person, yourself.  The big question is:  What are you selling, and to whom?  Even when you have a full-time, salaried, ‘Corporate America’ position, you are still running your own business.  You are selling one unit of your existence (an hour of your life) at a set price (the associated fraction of your salary) to a customer (your employer).So how can you simultaneously save your time and increase your profit?  The answer is slightly different for everyone.  But it’s an answer you should be seeking.  The 4-Hour Workweek is a good read on this topic.#4 – Having too many choices interferes with decision making.Here in the 21st century where information moves at the speed of light and opportunities for innovation seem endless, we have an abundant array of choices when it comes to designing our lives and careers.  But sadly, an abundance of choice often leads to indecision, confusion and inaction.Several business and marketing studies have shown that the more product choices a consumer is faced with, the less products they typically buy.  After all, narrowing down the best product from a pool of three choices is certainly a lot easier than narrowing down the best product from a pool of three hundred choices.  If the purchasing decision is tough to make, most people will just give up.So if you’re selling a product line, keep it simple.  And if you’re trying to make a decision about something in your life, don’t waste all your time evaluating every last detail of every possible option.  Choose something that you think will work and give it a shot.  If it doesn’t work out, choose something else and keep pressing forward.#5 – All people possess dimensions of success and dimensions of failure.This point is somewhat related to point #2 on happiness and success, but it stands strong on its own as well…Trying to be perfect is a waste of time and energy.  Perfection is an illusion.All people, even our idols, are multidimensional.  Powerful business men, polished musicians, bestselling authors, and even our own parents all have dimensions of success and dimensions of failure present in their lives.Our successful dimensions usually encompass the things we spend the most time doing.  We are successful in these dimensions because of our prolonged commitment to them.  This is the part of our lives we want others to see – the successful part that holds our life’s work.  It’s the notion of putting our best foot forward.  It’s the public persona we envision as our personal legacy:  “The Successful ABC” or “The Award Winning XYZ.”But behind whichever polished storyline we publically promote, there lies a multi-dimensional human being with a long list of unprofessed failures.  Sometimes this person is a bad husband or wife.  Sometimes this person laughs at the expense of others.  And sometimes this person merely takes their eyes off the road and rear-ends the car in front of them.#6 – Every mistake you make is progress.Mistakes teach you important lessons.  Every time you make one, you’re one step closer to your goal.  The only mistake that can truly hurt you is choosing to do nothing simply because you’re too scared to make a mistake.So don’t hesitate – don’t doubt yourself.  In life, it’s rarely about getting a chance; it’s about taking a chance.  You’ll never be 100% sure it will work, but you can always be 100% sure doing nothing won’t work.  Most of the time you just have to go for it!And no matter how it turns out, it always ends up just the way it should be.  Either you succeed or you learn something.  Win-Win.  Remember, if you never act, you will never know for sure, and you will be left standing in the same spot forever.#7 – People can be great at doing things they don’t like to do.Although I’m not suggesting that you choose a career or trade you dislike, I’ve heard way too many smart people say something like, “In order to be great at what you do, you have to like what you do.”  This just isn’t true.A good friend of mine is a public accountant.  He has told me on numerous occasions that he dislikes his job – “that it bores him to death.”  But he frequently gets raises and promotions.  At the age of 28, out of nearly a thousand Jr. Accountants in his division, he’s one of only two who were promoted to be Sr. Accountants this past year.  Why?  Because even though he doesn’t like doing it, he’s good at what he does.I could come up with dozens of other examples just like this, but I’ll spare you the details.  Just realize that if someone dedicates enough time and attention to perfecting a skill or trade, they can be insanely good at doing something they don’t like to do.  For an insightful read in this department, I highly recommend The Talent Code.#8 – The problems we have with others are typically more about us.Quite often, the problems we have with others – our spouse, parents, siblings, etc. – don’t really have much to do with them at all.  Because many of the problems we think we have with them we subconsciously created in our own mind.  Maybe they did something in the past that touched on one of our fears or insecurities.  Or maybe they didn’t do something that we expected them to do.  In either case, problems like these are not about the other person, they’re about us.And that’s okay.  It simply means these little predicaments will be easier to solve.   We are, after all, in charge of our own decisions.  We get to decide whether we want to keep our head cluttered with events from the past, or instead open our minds to the positive realities unfolding in front of us.All we need is the willingness to look at things a little differently – letting go of ‘what was’ and ‘what should have been,’ and instead focusing our energy on ‘what is’ and ‘what could be possible.’#9 – Emotional decisions are rarely good decisions.Decisions driven by heavy emotion are typically misguided reactions rather than educated judgments.  These reactions are the byproduct of minimal amounts of conscious thought and primarily based on momentary ‘feelings’ instead of mindful awareness.The best advice here is simple:  Don’t let your emotions trump your intelligence.  Slow down and think things through before you make any life-changing decisions.#10 – You will never feel 100% ready when an opportunity arises.The number one thing I persistently see holding smart people back is their own reluctance to accept an opportunity simply because they don’t think they’re ready.  In other words, they believe they require additional knowledge, skill, experience, etc. before they can aptly partake in the opportunity.  Sadly, this is the kind of thinking that stifles personal growth.The truth is nobody ever feels 100% ready when an opportunity arises.  Because most great opportunities in life force us to grow emotionally and intellectually.  They force us to stretch ourselves and our comfort zones, which means we won’t feel totally comfortable at first.  And when we don’t feel comfortable, we don’t feel ready.Just remember that significant moments of opportunity for personal growth and development will come and go throughout your lifetime.  If you are looking to make positive changes in your life you will need to embrace these moments of opportunity even though you will never feel 100% ready for them.Photo by: Alemdag 40 Extraordinary Things Happening Right Now|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/40-extraordinary-things.jpg?resize=500%2C330&ssl=1|Right now is a phenomenon.

"16 Harsh Truths that Make Us Stronger|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/harsh-truths-stronger.jpg?resize=500%2C334&ssl=1|It takes more courage to reveal insecurities than to hide them, more strength to relate to people than to dominate them, more manhood (or womanhood) to abide by thought-out principles rather than blind reflex. Toughness is in the soul and spirit, not in muscles and an immature mind.– Alex KarrasLife is not easy. – Hard work makes people lucky – it’s the stuff that brings dreams to reality.  So start every morning ready to run farther than you did yesterday and fight harder than you ever have before.  (Read The Road Less Traveled.)You will fail sometimes.  – The faster you accept this, the faster you can get on with being brilliant.  You’ll never be 100% sure it will work, but you can always be 100% sure doing nothing won’t work.  So get out there and do something!  Either you succeed or you learn a vital lesson.  Win – Win.Right now, there’s a lot you don’t know. – The day you stop learning is the day you stop living.  Embrace new information, think about it and use it to advance yourself.There may not be a tomorrow. – Not for everyone.  Right now, someone on Earth is planning something for tomorrow without realizing they’re going to die today.  This is sad but true.  So spend your time wisely today and pause long enough to appreciate it.There’s a lot you can’t control. – Wasting your time, talent and emotional energy on things that are beyond your control is a recipe for frustration, misery and stagnation.  Invest your energy in the things you can control.Information is not true knowledge. – Knowledge comes from experience.  You can discuss a task a hundred times, but these discussions will only give you a philosophical understanding.  You must experience a task firsthand to truly know it.You can’t be successful without providing value. – Don’t waste your time trying to be successful, spend your time creating value.  When you’re valuable to the world around you, you will be successful.  (Read Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?)Someone else will always have more than you.  – Whether it’s money, friends or magic beans that you’re collecting, there will always be someone who has more than you.  But remember, it’s not how many you have, it’s how passionate you are about collecting them.  It’s all about the journey.You can’t change the past. – As Maria Robinson once said, “Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending.”  You can’t change what happened, but you can change how you react to it.The only person who can make you happy is you. – The root of your happiness comes from your relationship with yourself.  Sure external entities can have fleeting effects on your mood, but in the long run nothing matters more than how you feel about who you are on the inside.There will always be people who don’t like you. – You can’t be everything to everyone.  No matter what you do, there will always be someone who thinks differently.  So concentrate on doing what you know in your heart is right.  What others think and say about you isn’t all that important.  What is important is how you feel about yourself.You won’t always get what you want. – As Mick Jagger once said, “You can’t always get what you want, but if you try sometimes you might find you get what you need.”  Look around.  Appreciate the things you have right now.  Many people aren’t so lucky.In life, you get what you put in. – If you want love, give love.  If you want friends, be friendly.  If you want money, provide value.  It really is this simple.  (Read The Four Agreements.)Good friends will come and go. – Most of your high school friends won’t be a part of your college life.  Most of your college friends won’t be a part of your 20-something professional life.  Most of your 20-something friends won’t be there when your spouse and you bring your second child into the world.  But some friends will stick.  And it’s these friends – the ones who transcend time with you – who matter.Doing the same exact thing every day hinders self growth. – If you keep doing what you’re doing, you’ll keep getting what you’re getting.  Growth happens when you change things – when you try new things – when you stretch beyond your comfort zone.You will never feel 100% ready for something new. – Nobody ever feels 100% ready when an opportunity arises.  Because most great opportunities in life force us to grow beyond our comfort zones, which means you won’t feel totally comfortable or ready for it.And remember, trying to be someone else is a waste of the person you are.  Strength comes from being comfortable in your own skin.Photo by: Jhong Dizon 10 Commandments for a Good Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/commandments-good-life.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1|A good life is when you assume nothing, do more, need less, smile often and realize how fortunate you are right now.  It’s about the simple pleasures that make you happy, the compassionate deeds you perform, the personal goals you strive to achieve, the relationships you nurture and the legacy you leave behind.So starting today, choose to take control.  Here are ten commandments to help you live a good life.And in the end, it’s not the years in your life that count.It’s the life in your years.– Abraham LincolnI.  I am not perfect and I will not try to be.Think of how many things don’t get done in this world simply because people are waiting for the perfect time, place and circumstance.The real world doesn’t reward perfectionists.  It rewards people who get things done.  And the only way to get things done is to be imperfect 99% of the time.  (Read Too Perfect.)ll.  I cannot, and will not try, to please everyone.No matter what you do or how you do it, there will always be people that disagree with what you’re doing.  That’s life.  So don’t try to please everyone.  Simply do what you know is right.And remember, it doesn’t matter how many people don’t get it, it matters how many people do.III.  I will take part in something I believe in.This could be anything.  Some people take an active role in their city council, some find refuge in religious faith, some join social clubs supporting causes they believe in and others find passion in their careers.  In each case the psychological outcome is the same.  They engage themselves in something they strongly believe in.  This engagement brings happiness and meaning into their lives.IV.  I will prioritize my obligations and do important things first.Set priorities for yourself and act accordingly.  It’s the only way to get things done.It’s the only way to turn a dream into a reality.  (Read Getting Things Done.)V.  I will choose my friends wisely.Your friends are family you choose.  So make sure you choose friends who are worthy of your time and attention.Surround yourself with people who reflect the person you want to be.  Choose friends who you are proud to know, people you admire, who love and respect you – people who make your day a little brighter simply by being in it.VI.  I will help others when I am able.In life, you get what you put in.When you make a positive impact in someone else’s life, you also make a positive impact in your own life.  The more you help others, the more they will want to help you.VII.  I will focus on the positive.Positive thinking is at the forefront of every great success story.  The mind must believe it can do something before it is capable of actually doing it.The way to overcome negative thoughts and destructive emotions is to develop opposing, positive emotions that are stronger and more powerful.  Listen to your self-talk and replace negative thoughts with positive ones.  Regardless of how a situation seems, focus on the next positive step forward.VIII.  I can only be me.Judy Garland once said, “Always be a first rate version of yourself instead of a second rate version of somebody else.”  Live by this statement.There is no such thing as living in someone else’s shoes.  The only shoes you can occupy are your own.  If you aren’t being yourself, you aren’t truly living – you’re merely existing.  And ask yourself this:  If you don’t like who you really are, why should I like you?Trying to be somebody you’re not is not sexy.  Be you.  That’s when you’re beautiful.IX.  I will be here now.Life is happening right now.  Instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, practice being and living in the present moment.Remember, right now is the only moment guaranteed to you.  Right now is life.  Don’t miss it.  (Read Zen and the Art of Happiness.)X.  Life never gets any better, only my perception of it does.The world around you changes when you change.If you awake every morning with the thought that something wonderful will happen in your life today, and you pay close attention, you’ll often find that you’re right.  The opposite is also true.  The choice is yours to make.Photo by: Eduardo Amorim 50 Things You Need To Give Up Today|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/50-things-give-up.jpg?resize=500%2C378&ssl=1|When you stop chasing the wrong things, you give the right things a chance to catch you.So starting today…Give up trying to be perfect. – The real world doesn’t reward perfectionists, it rewards people who get things done.  Read Getting Things Done.Give up comparing yourself to others. – The only person you are competing against is yourself.Give up dwelling on the past or worrying too much about the future. – Right now is the only moment guaranteed to you.  Right now is life.  Don’t miss it.Give up complaining. – Do something about it.Give up holding grudges. – Grudges are a waste of perfect happiness.Give up waiting. – What we don’t start today won’t be finished by tomorrow.  Knowledge and intelligence are both useless without action.Give up lying. – In the long-run the truth always reveals itself.  Either you own up to your actions or your actions will ultimately own you.Give up trying to avoid mistakes. – The only mistake that can truly hurt you is choosing to do nothing simply because you’re too scared to make a mistake.Give up saying, “I can’t.” – As Henry Ford put it, “Whether you think you can or you think you can’t, you are right.”Give up trying to be everything to everyone. – Making one person smile can change the world.  Maybe not the whole world, but their world.  Start small.  Start now.Give up thinking you’re not ready. – Nobody ever feels 100% ready when an opportunity arises.  Because most great opportunities in life force us to grow beyond our comfort zones, which means we won’t feel totally comfortable at first.Give up setting small goals for yourself. – Many people set small goals because they’re afraid to fail.  Ironically, setting these small goals is what makes them fail.Give up trying to do everything by yourself. – You are the sum of the people you spend the most time with.  If you work together, you will be far more capable and powerful than you ever could have been alone.Give up buying things you don’t need. – Manage your money wisely so your money does not manage you.  Do not spend to impress others.  Do not live life trying to fool yourself into thinking wealth is measured in material objects.  Read I Will Teach You To Be Rich.Give up blaming others for your troubles. – The extent to which you can live your dream life depends on the extent to which you take responsibility for your life.  When you blame others for what you’re going through, you deny responsibility – you give others power over that part of your life.Give up making mountains out of molehills. – One way to check if something is worth mulling over is to ask yourself this question: “Will this matter in one year’s time?  Three years?  Five years?  If not, then it’s not worth worrying about.Give up trying to live up to the expectations of others. – Work on it for real and exceed your own expectations.  Everything else will fall into place.Give up the ‘easy street’ mentality. – There is too much emphasis on finding a ‘quick fix’ in today’s society.  For example taking diet pills to lose weight instead of exercising and eating well.  No amount of magic fairy dust replaces diligent, focused, hard work.Give up making promises you can’t keep. – Don’t over-promise.  Over-deliver on everything you do.Give up letting your thoughts and feelings bottle up inside. – People are not mind readers.  They will never know how you feel unless you tell them.Give up beating around the bush. – Say what you mean and mean what you say.  Communicate effectively.Give up avoiding change. – However good or bad a situation is now, it will change.  That’s the one thing you can count on.  So embrace change and realize that change happens for a reason.  It won’t always be easy or obvious at first, but in the end it will be worth it.Give up your sense of entitlement. – Nobody is entitled to anything in this world.  We are all equal.  We breathe the same air.  We get what we give.  We get what we earn.Give up waiting until the last minute. – Those who fail to plan, plan to fail.Give up being dramatic. – Stay out of other people’s drama and don’t needlessly create your own.Give up being anti-athletic. – Get your body moving!  Simply take a long, relaxing walk or commit 30 minutes to an at-home exercise program like the P90X workout.Give up junk food. – You are what you eat.  Read The 4-Hour Body.Give up eating as a means of entertainment. – Don’t eat when you’re bored.  Eat when you’re hungry.Give up foolish habits that you know are foolish. – Don’t text and drive.  Don’t drink and drive.  Don’t smoke.  Etc.Give up relationships with people who bring you down. – Saying “no” to right people gives you the time and resources required to say “yes” to right opportunities.  Spend time with nice people who are smart, driven and likeminded.Give up being shy. – Network with people.  Meet new people.  Ask questions.  Introduce yourself.Give up worrying about what others think of you. – Unless you’re trying to make a great first impression (job interview, first date, etc.), don’t let the opinions of others stand in your way.  What they think and say about you isn’t important.  What is important is how you feel about yourself.Give up trying to control everything. – Life is an unpredictable phenomenon.  No matter how good or bad things seem right now, we can never be 100% certain what will happen next.  So do you best with what’s in front of you and leave the rest to the powers above you.Give up doing the same thing over and over again. – In order to grow, you must expand your horizons and break free of your comfort zone.  If you keep doing what you’re doing, you’ll keep getting what you’re getting.Give up following the path of least resistance. – Life is not easy, especially when you plan on achieving something worthwhile.  Don’t find the easy way out.  Do something extraordinary.Give up persistent multi-tasking. – Do one thing at a time and do it right.Give up thinking others are luckier than you. – The harder you work, the luckier you will become.Give up filling every waking moment with commitments and activities. – It’s okay to be alone.  It’s okay to do nothing sometimes.  Think.  Relax. Breathe.  Be.Give up making emotional decisions. – Don’t let your emotions trump your intelligence.  Slow down and think things through before you make any life-changing decisions.Give up doing the wrong things just because you can get away with it. – Just because you can get away with something doesn’t mean you should do it.  Think bigger.  Keep the end in mind.  Do what you know in your heart is right.Give up focusing on what you don’t want to happen. – Focus on what you do want to happen.  Positive thinking is at the forefront of every great success story.  If you awake every morning with the thought that something wonderful will happen in your life today, and you pay close attention, you’ll often find that you’re right.Give up taking yourself so seriously. – Few others do anyway.  So enjoy yourself and have a little fun while you can.Give up spending your life working in a career field you’re not passionate about. – Life is too short for such nonsense.  The right career choice is based on one key point: Finding hard work you love doing.  So if you catch yourself working hard and loving every minute of it, don’t stop.  You’re on to something big.  Because hard work ain’t hard when you concentrate on your passions.  Read The 4-Hour Workweek.Give up thinking about the things you don’t have. – Appreciate everything you do have.  Many people aren’t so lucky.Give up doubting others. – People who are determined do remarkable things.  Remember, the one who says it can’t be done should never interrupt the one doing it.Give up fussing with every beauty product on the market. – Good looks attracts the eyes.  Personality attracts the heart.  Be proud to be you.  That’s when you’re beautiful.Give up trying to fit in. – Don’t mold yourself into someone you’re not.  Be yourself.  Oftentimes, the only reason they want you to fit in is that once you do they can ignore you and go about their business.Give up trying to be different for the sake of being different. – Nonconformity for the sake of nonconformity is conformity.  When people try too hard to be different, they usually end up being just like everyone else who is trying to be different.  Once again, be yourself.Give up trying to avoid risk. – There’s no such thing as ‘risk free.’  Everything you do or don’t do has an inherent risk.Give up putting your own needs on the back burner. – Yes, help others, but help yourself too.  If there was ever a moment to follow your passion and do something that matters to you, that moment is now.And remember, mistakes make us human, failures help us grow, hope keeps us going and love is the reason we’re alive.  So keep learning, loving and living.  Never give up on yourself.Photo by: Ai-lueh Chen 12 Steps to Make a Dream a Reality|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/make-a-dream-a-reality.jpg?resize=500%2C356&ssl=1|No fluff.  No frills.  No filler.Here are 12 fundamental steps for turning the dreams and ideas in your mind into realities in your life.We all have our own life to pursue,our own kind of dream to be weaving.And we all have some power to make wishes come true,as long as we keep believing.– Louisa May AlcottStep #1 – Lose the negative attitude.  Think positively.Negative thinking creates negative results.  Positive thinking creates positive results.  Period.Every one of the other suggestions below are irrelevant if your mind is stuck in the gutter.  Positive thinking is at the forefront of every great success story.  The mind must believe it can do something before it is capable of actually doing it.  For some practical positive thinking guidance I recommend reading The Power of Positive Thinking.Step #2 – Figure out what you really want out of life.You’ll be running on a hamster wheel forever if you never decide where you want to go.  Figure out what’s meaningful to you so you can be who you were born to be.Some of us were born to be musicians – to communicate intricate thoughts and rousing feelings with the strings of a guitar.  Some of us were born to be poets – to touch people’s hearts with exquisite prose.  Some of us were born to be entrepreneurs – to create growth and opportunity where others saw rubbish.  And still, some of us were born to be or do whatever it is, specifically, that moves you.Don’t waste your life fulfilling someone else’s dreams and desires.  You must follow your intuition and make a decision.Step #3 – Surround yourself with great people.You are the sum of the people you spend the most time with.  If you hang with the wrong people, they will negatively affect you.  But if you hang with the right people, you will be far more capable and powerful than you ever could have been alone.  Find your tribe and work together to make a difference in all of your lives.  Tribes by Seth Godin is a great read on this topic.Step #4 – Work on it for real.The harder you work the luckier you will become.  Stop waiting around for things to work out.  If you keep doing what you’re doing, you’ll keep getting what you’re getting.While many of us decide at some point during the course of our lives that we want to answer our calling, only an astute few of us actually work on it.  By “working on it,” I mean truly devoting oneself to the end result.  The rest of us never act on our decision.  Or, at best, we pretend to act on it by putting forth an uninspired, half-assed effort.Remember, life is not easy, especially when you plan on achieving something worthwhile.  Achieving your dreams can be a lot of work.  Be ready for it.Step #5 – Don’t make life harder than it needs to be.Life is challenging enough without you senselessly complicating the simple.As Oscar Wilde once said, “Life is not complex.  We are complex.  Life is simple, and the simple thing is the right thing.”Read our article 60 Ways To Make Life Simple Again for good a reminder.Step #6 – Exploit the resources you do have access to.It’s not about having the right resources; it’s about exploiting the resources you do have access to.Stevie Wonder couldn’t see, so he exploited his sense of hearing into a passion for music, and he now has 25 Grammy Awards to prove it.Get it?Step #7 – Focus on things you can change.Some forces are out of your control.  The best thing you can do is do the best with what’s in front of you with the resources you do have access to.Wasting your time, talent and emotional energy on things that are beyond your control is a recipe for frustration, misery and stagnation.  Invest your energy in the things you can change.Step #8 – Don’t avoid things you don’t understand.Right now there’s a lot you don’t know.  No matter how smart you are or how much you learn there will always be more to learn.  Hiding from what you don’t know will bury you right beside your dreams.So embrace the things you don’t understand and study them.   Achieving this understanding is what living your life is all about.Step #9 – Ignore negative naysayers.When you receive negative feedback, remember, it doesn’t matter how many people don’t get it, it matters how many do.Still, no matter how much progress you make there will always be the people who insist that whatever you’re trying to do is impossible.  Or they may incessantly suggest that the idea or dream as a whole is utterly ridiculous because nobody really cares.When you come across these people, don’t try to reason with them.  Instead, forget that they exist.  They will only waste your time and energy.Step #10 – Take good care of your body and your brain.Your body is the greatest tool you’ll ever own.  It impacts every step you take and every move you make.  You won’t get anything done without it.And don’t forget that your brain is part of your body too.  The human brain only accounts for roughly 2% of the total mass of the human body, yet it consumes over 20% of the oxygen and nutrients the human body intakes.So nourish your body, exercise it and rest it appropriately.  Read The 4-Hour Body.Step #11 – Work on your dreams when you first awake.The mornings are a fresh start, peaceful and free of random mid-day distractions.  If you get the things done that are the most important to you first thing in the morning, it puts you in a better place, emotionally and creatively, for the remainder of the day.So put your dreams first.  Even if you only have time to work on them for 30 minutes each morning, do it.  It truly makes all the difference in the world.  Each day, no matter what else happens, you will have done something to make your dreams come true.Step #12 – Enjoy the pain of your greatest challenge.Lots of people have achieved their dreams or conquered formerly impossible feats and continue to enjoy the possibilities of new challenges.  These people will all tell you there’s nothing more gratifying than the thrill of your greatest challenge – making your dreams a reality.  The inherent bruises and pains along the way are simply mile markers on your trip to the finish line.And when you finally do finish, you may actually find yourself missing the daily grind.  Ultimately, you’ll realize that pleasure and pain can be one and the same.Final ThoughtsAs I’ve said before, if there was ever a moment to follow your heart and do something that matters to you, that moment is now.  Nothing ever gets done by reading an article about doing it.  You’ve got to put in the effort and take action.So go for it!  Now!  Make yourself proud.Photo by: Per Ola Wiberg 365 Thought Provoking Questions to Ask Yourself This

"18 Great Reads That Changed My Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/25-great-reads.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1|It’s fairly easy to find a well written book or online article.  But it’s not always easy to find one with genuine value that you connect with.That’s because, these days, books and online articles are a dime a dozen.  There are literally thousands of them written on the same topic every year.  So deciphering the ‘good’ from the ‘great’ can prove to be quite a challenge.But if you look hard enough, in the right places, you’ll find a few gems containing life-altering advice that can be immediately implemented and used as an instrument for self-improvement.For this reason, I’ve compiled the following list of books and online articles containing value so profound that each of them literally changed my life.I therefore extend my gratitude to the authors and pass them along to you with the simple hope that they will provide value to you as well.Happy reading…The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle – Tolle’s message is clear: living in the now is the truest path to happiness and enlightenment.  This book is carefully, thoughtfully and beautifully written.  Not only does it illuminate the fundamental, slippery, destructive patterns of the mind or ego which confound one’s spiritual and even physical well-being, but it also provides a variety of simple and practical techniques for breaking down and dissolving these various forms of mental pollution.  I use Tolle’s calming, contemplative techniques almost every day and they work wonderfully for me.The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck– Pretty much the granddaddy of all self-improvement books, it’s easily one of the best nonfiction works I’ve ever read.  By melding love, science, and spirituality into a primer for personal growth, Peck guides the reader through lessons on delaying gratification, accepting responsibility for decisions, dedicating oneself to truth and reality, and creating a balanced lifestyle.“Find what you love.” – 2005 Stanford Commencement Address by Steve Jobs – In his 2005 Stanford University commencement address Steve Jobs discussed three personal stories from his life.  The advice he delivered was clear: find what you love, trust in your instincts, and follow your heart.  Before reading Jobs’ speech back in 2005, I was struggling with a job I didn’t love because it was really the only thing I had ever tried.  It was all I knew. Jobs says, “You’ve got to find what you love.” And his article helped me do just that.  I finally realized that I was wasting my life living someone else’s dream.  If I settled for someone else’s dream, I’d grow old and die without ever seeking my own.Getting Things Done by David Allen – The ultimate ‘organize your life’ book.  Allen’s ideas and processes are for all those people who are overwhelmed with too many things to do, too little time to do them, and a general sense of unease that something important is being missed.  The primary goal of this book is to teach you how to effectively get your ‘to-do inbox’ to empty.Advice, Like Youth, Probably Just Wasted on the Young by Mary Schmich – While the advice here is a bit more inspirational than it is practical, I have always enjoyed this short piece of literature.  In the late 1990’s when I was in high school it became an international phenomenon when it was turned into a slow rock song by Baz Luhrmann (director of the 1996 movie Romeo and Juliet) that jumped to #1 on the U.S. and U.K. pop charts.  The song was played at my high school’s class of 1999 graduation commencement ceremony.  It eventually became famously known as “Wear Sunscreen.”  Details aside, I still re-read it in it’s entirety from time to time when I need a quick dose of inspiration.Don’t Die With Your Music Still In You by Steve Pavlina– Above all, this short read taught me that “to abandon a comfortable lifestyle that isn’t deeply fulfilling is to abandon nothing at all.”  It helped me understand that I was defending a comfortable, unfulfilling career without good reason.  At the start of each workday, I was reluctant to get out of bed.  At the end of each workday, the amount of satisfaction I received from the work I was doing was insignificant.  Which in turn caused me to ask myself: Why should I stay loyal to such a meaningless job?  So I switched it up and never looked back.Switch: How To Change Things When Change Is Hard by Chip and Dan Heath – A super great psychology book about real, concrete ways to make lasting change in both your personal and professional life.  So many powerful insights, based on fact not theory.  Inspiring counter-intuitive stories of huge organizational change against all odds.  As they explain in the first chapter, “All successful changes share a common pattern.”  I highly recommended this read for everyone.The Richest Man in Babylon by George S. Clason – The best book on money management ever written.  Although only 145 pages, this book is packed to the brim with powerful, life changing information.  I’ve read it three times and I still pull new pearls of wisdom out of it.  Babylon should be mandatory reading beginning at the grade school level, then again in college, and should be given as a gift right along with a college diploma.How To Become A Millionaire In Three Years by Jason L. Baptiste – Every once in a while I come across an online article I wish I had read ten years ago.  This is one of them.  It contains timeless advice on making money by building something of your own.  Every wannabe entrepreneur should print this out, hang it on their refrigerator, and read it every morning.  That’s what I did with it.How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie – Easily one of the best and most popular books on people-skills ever written. Carnegie uses his adept storytelling skills to illustrate how to be successful by making the most of human relations.How to Find What You Love to Do by Brian Kim – For me, this short read was a wake-up call.  It’s basically a how-to guide based on the ideas Steve Jobs presented in his 2005 commencement address.  Kim emphasizes the importance of self-assessment and made me take a long hard look at myself to figure out what it is that makes me happy.  What’s more, his article discusses how uncertainty and fear are the most common obstacles preventing people from doing what they love to do.  His solution involves self-analysis: identify your skills and interests, then use your strengths to live your passion.  In Kim’s words, “conquer indecision and ACT, and you will most definitely conquer all fear.”The Magic of Thinking Big by David Schwartz – This is another classic self-improvement book.  Schwartz gives the reader useful, proactive steps for achieving success.  He presents a clear-cut program for getting the most out of your job, marriage, family life, and other relationships.  In doing so, he proves that you don’t need to be an intellectual or have innate talent to attain great success and satisfaction in life.Everything You Wanted to Know About Simplifying Your Life by Leo Babauta – This compilation of online articles has truly helped me simplify my life.  Together, they cover everything from appreciating simple pleasures to decluttering your work space.  These articles are about creating a simple life for yourself, which means getting rid of many of the things you do so you can spend time with people you love and do the things you love and value.  If you’re looking to simplify your life, look no further.Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazzi – Ferrazzi explains the guiding principles he has mastered over a lifetime of personal and professional networking and describes what it takes to build the kind of lasting, mutually beneficial relationships that lead to professional and personal success.  Most of this book is fantastic – you learn how to relate to people, how to establish contacts and maintain connections, and how to create a social network.  If you interact with a lot of people on a regular basis, it’s a great read.The Most Important Blog Post You’ll Probably Never Read by Glen AllSopp – If you’re even slightly interested in making money online as a blogger, website owner, etc., then this article is for you.  It provides a short, insightful, bullsh**t free look at how to do just that.  It really opened my eyes to perspectives on success that I wasn’t seeing clearly beforehand.Linchpin: Are You Indispensable? by Seth Godin – A linchpin, as Seth describes it, is somebody in an organization who is indispensable, who cannot be replaced—her role is just far too unique and valuable.  And then he goes on to say, well, seriously folks, you need to be one of these people, you really do.  To not be one is economic and career suicide.  It is a book that reveals the truth about working for a boss, fitting in and following the rules.  The only way to create a good life for yourself is to become indispensable and stand out.The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho – More parable than novel, “The Alchemist” uses the story of young shepherd Santiago’s search for his personal legend as an allegory for everyman’s struggle to break from the comfortable confines of conformity and pursue his life dreams.  Along the way, of course, our young everyman is beset by numerous setbacks, testing his resolve and forcing him to become attuned to the Soul of the World in order to survive.  By paying attention to the details in the world around him, which serve as omens guiding him towards his goal, young Santiago becomes an alchemist in his own right, spinning unfavorable circumstances into riches.  I’ve read this tale a few times now, and it always provides priceless inspiration.18 Things I Wish I Knew When I Was 18 by me – I know what you’re thinking.  How did an article I personally wrote change my life?  Well, it’s all about the soul searching that went into writing it.  I had to dig deep within myself and seriously contemplate all the important lessons I’ve learned over the last ten years.  In doing so, I noticed a few things that were out of place in my life, and I adjusted them.  I can already directly attribute a few of my recent successes to the actions I took after I wrote this article.Can you think of a book or online article that changed your life?  Please share it with us in the comments.This article was co-written by Marc and Angel and Shaun Boyd.Photo by: Éole What Life Is All About|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/what-life-is-all-about.jpg?resize=500%2C354&ssl=1|Once upon a time, there was a girl who could do anything in the world she wanted.  All she had to do was choose something and focus.  So one day she sat down in front of a blank canvas and began to paint.  Every stroke was more perfect than the next, slowly and gracefully converging to build a flawless masterpiece.  And when she eventually finished painting, she stared proudly at her work and smiled.It was obvious to the clouds and the stars, who were always watching over her, that she had a gift.  She was an artist.  And she knew it too.  She felt it in every fiber of her being.  But a few moments after she finished painting, she got anxious and quickly stood up.  Because she realized that while she had the ability to do anything in the world she wanted to do, she was simply spending her time moving paint around on a piece of canvas.She felt like there was so much more in the world to see and do – so many options.  And if she ultimately decided to do something else with her life, then all the time she spent painting would be a waste.  So she glanced at her masterpiece one last time, and walked out the door into the moonlight.  And as she walked, she thought, and then she walked some more.While she was walking, she didn’t notice the clouds and the stars in the sky who were trying to signal her, because she was preoccupied with an important decision she had to make.  She had to choose one thing to do out of all the possibilities in the world.  Should she practice medicine?  Or design buildings?  Or teach children?  She was utterly stumped.Twenty-five years later, the girl began to cry.  Because she realized she had been walking for so long, and that over the years she had become so enamored by everything that she could do – the endless array of possibilities – that she hadn’t done anything meaningful at all.  And she learned, at last, that life isn’t about possibility – anything is possible.  Life is about making a decision – deciding to do something that moves you.So the girl, who was no longer a girl, purchased some canvas and paint from a local craft store, drove to a nearby park, and began to paint.  One stroke gracefully led into the next just as it had so many moons ago.  And as she smiled, she continued painting through the day and into the night.  Because she had finally made a decision.  And there was still some time left to revel in the magic that life is all about.Photo by: James Jordan 25 Lessons I’ve Learned In 50 Years|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/25-before-50.jpg?resize=500%2C296&ssl=1|This is a guest post by Barrie Davenport of Live Bold and Bloom.For anyone under 50 reading this, I have some good news for you.  50 is pretty darned good!I even surprise myself by writing this, because believe me, I never thought the day would come when I would embrace being half a century.  But it has arrived, and it doesn’t stink.Yes, yes — there are the inevitable physical changes that are quite unsettling.  Things do start to droop, wrinkle and expand.  Sometimes you will catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror and wonder who that middle-aged person is.  On the outside, you may look like a grown-up, but on the inside it’s crazy how you still feel like you are 30.  Or younger.  (Ask my teenagers.  They hate that about me.)When I was in my 30’s and 40’s, I took life much more seriously.In fact, I think I was mysteriously older then than I am now.  Is that possible?  When you are busy building a career, raising children, accumulating stuff, and creating a lifestyle, you are defined by that busyness.  It’s serious work.  You have to make money to pay for the lifestyle.  Your kids need to be raised right lest they become a scourge on society and embarrass you by living in a trailer and eating bugs.Those years are fulfilling and wonderful, but they also are fraught with upheaval and angst.  Things that once didn’t matter when you were younger, like having the right cocktail napkins or winning yard of the month, somehow matter so very much.  We struggle toward some kind of perfection and achievement that is ‘out there’ somewhere.I don’t know about you, but I have spent a lot of time trying to create the self I thought I should be.  I cobbled together the perfect me made from pieces of this and that.  The clothes I wear, the neighborhood we live in, the car I drive, the friends I have.  It looks pretty nice from the outside.  And much of it is nice on the inside too.But I spent way, way too much time in the work of crafting myself, and far too little time just being myself. When you are spinning your wheels to maintain this beautifully crafted life, you miss out on a whole lot of real living.If I were able to time travel and visit my twenty or thirty-year-old self, there are some things I would really like to teach me.  Since I can’t do that, hopefully you will benefit from some of the lessons I’ve learned over the last 50 years.50 doesn’t feel like 50.  It doesn’t feel like the age you imagined when you are in your 20’s or 30’s.  For the most part, it feels the way you feel right now.  But smarter and more confident.  You also have more time and resources to enjoy life.  So don’t fear it.  Look forward to it.Experience life before you settle down.  Whatever it is you want to do or experience, do as much of it as you can before you have children.  Especially travel.  Live in a hovel and drive a beat-up Dodge Dart if you have to.  But go have some really great, amazing, mind-blowing experiences.Money and stuff are not all that important.  Yes, you want enough to be comfortable and do the things you want to do.  But accumulating for the sake of accumulating is so boring and empty.  Feed the soul, not the ego.Don’t try to impress people.  That’s an act that brings nothing but a momentary ego boost.  Be real with people instead.  Connect with fewer people on a level that is deeper and more profound.Let your kids fail.  Your kids will be okay, even if you think they are headed for the juvie right now.  Don’t come to their rescue all the time.  Don’t manage every detail of their lives or over-schedule them with tao quan dao or viola lessons.  Give them some boundaries, and then relax about them.Bad things will happen.  Part of living and getting older is experiencing upheavals in life.  People lose jobs, get divorced, die.  When you are younger, and things have gone pretty well, this can be shocking.  The bad things won’t kill you.  You will learn from them if you allow it. Not much is worth fighting about.  If you can avoid it, don’t fight.  Step back from arguments with your spouse or family member or neighbor.  When you feel anger surging up and you want to say that snarky thing on the tip of your tongue, just close your mouth and walk away.  Let yourself calm down.  You don’t have to be right or win the argument.  It just doesn’t matter that much.Little things stick with you.  So pay attention to them.  Like watching your child sleep.  Preparing a meal with your family.  Sharing a great laugh with an old friend.  That is the real stuff life is made of.Keep having fun.  Fun is way underrated.  With all of our responsibilities, fun seems like an indulgence.  It shouldn’t be.  It should be a requirement.  Remember what you did to have fun when you were younger, and go do it again.  Leave the house messy and the yard un-mowed for the weekend.  You will remember the fun, not the clean house or yard.  Make time for fun.Make things simpler.  Pick the five most important things in your life now, and focus on those things.  Let the other stuff go.  Let go of the activities, the events, the commitments, the shopping, the to-do lists.  Stop the busyness and really enjoy the important things you have right now.Keep your brain active.  Don’t get into a mental rut.  Do new things, learn new things, explore new ideas in all areas of your life.  Keep challenging yourself and your mind.  Be curious and interested in the world around you.Hang out with younger people.  Stay connected with what the generation behind you is doing and thinking.  Establish friendships with them.  You will benefit and learn from each other.  Don’t act superior, because younger people may know a whole lot more than you do!Keep exercising and eating healthy.  You know this, but I’ll remind you anyway.  The older you get, the more important a healthy lifestyle is.  In my 20’s, I could shovel down a Wendy’s hamburger and fries every day and never see the difference.  Now I just look at a hamburger and my butt gets bigger. Manage aging, but why fight it?  You can spend a fortune on face creams, plastic surgery, hair growth formulas, and botox, but eventually you realize you are fighting an uphill battle.  Groom yourself nicely.  Stay fit.  Have unsightly things removed.  But accept the beauty of aging.  A striking mature man or woman is much more attractive than someone who looks overly taunt, tanned or top-heavy.Everyone doesn’t have to like you and vice versa.  One of my friends likes to say, “She’s not in my cluster.”  Sometimes there are people in your life who are just not the right fit or who drain you dry.  It is fine to back off from them or even let them go.Marriages evolve and change.  The feelings you had for the man or woman you married will mutate and evolve several times over the life of a marriage.  Hopefully you will evolve in the same direction or at least embrace and accept the changes in the other person.  It takes work, and sometimes it takes counseling.  Don’t gloss over those changes or you may wake up next to a stranger one day.Yes, you can still have great sex.  When I was in my 20’s, I thought you stopped doing it when you were in your early 40’s.  I assumed middle aged people would no longer want to disrobe in front of each other.  I’m happy to inform you that this is not the case.Tend to your friendships.  Especially your oldest friendships.  These are the people who know and love you best, in spite of your flaws.  Treat them like the precious gems they are.Stop worrying.  Worry does absolutely nothing productive.  In fact, it is counterproductive.  The more you worry, the more you reinforce the problem or concern in your brain.Everything is not always black or white.  Life is often very ambiguous.  Sometimes there isn’t a right or wrong decision or choice.  Things are not always completely clear.  You may not get THE answer, so you just have to wing it.Take action on your dreams.  If you’ve been putting things off — a new career, more education, the big trip — start taking action right now to make it happen.  Don’t dream about it anymore.  Start doing it.Don’t dwell on your wounds.  Everyone has something that has caused pain and has been limiting them in some way.  If you need help to deal with it, then get it right away.  Don’t let the past limit your future.Embrace change.  As uncomfortable as it is sometimes, change allows us to stretch and grow.  New things feel awkward and scary at first, but those feelings go away, and you are left with something bigger and bolder in your life.Be vulnerable.  Allow yourself to feel, to be open and authentic.  Tear down any emotional brick walls you have built around yourself and feel every exquisite emotion, both good and bad.  This is real life.  This is how you welcome new opportunities.Count your blessings every day.  I know, this is a refrigerator magnet line, but practice it daily anyway.  There is so much good, so much beauty, so much love in your life.  What more do you really need?  You have so much right now, you just need to pause long enough to appreciate it.Barrie Davenport is a personal and career coach and the founder of Live Bold and Bloom, a blog about bold and fearless living.  Download her free ebook, How to Live a Meaningful Life.

The warm coziness of my own bed after I return home from a long business trip.Playing Rock-Paper-Scissors to settle a decision with one of your friends. When a wild animal is tame enough to eat food right out of your hand.Crying on my sister’s shoulder.  Without the help of my family and close friends, I would be lost in a world of emotion, stress, and confusion. Picking and eating fresh fruit right off the tree.The joy of watching a baby smile.The proud look on my 4-year-old son’s face when he learns a new skill.The bittersweet emotions that rush through your body on the very last day of high school. Time with the love of my life.  Last May, my husband of 27 years was diagnosed with cancer and given 3 to 6 months to live.  We prayed, cried, loved, and laughed.  Now, 11 months later, we are still savoring every smile, kiss, and breath.  We know these moments will end sooner rather than later, but we are so grateful for the time we do have together. The rush you get when you’re driving on the open road and your favorite song randomly plays on the radio. The comforting sound of my father’s car pulling into the driveway when he finally returns from a long business trip. When my baby girl looked up at me and said, “Daddy!” for the very first time. Seeing two elderly folks who are madly in love.  It’s a sight of love that has surpassed the tests of time. Kissing in the rain. The feeling of cool morning grass under your bare feet when you walk out to get the newspaper at sunrise. Beginner’s eyes.  You’ll never see it again for the very first time. The sound and sight of ocean waves. The feeling you get inside when you go out of your way to make someone’s day a little brighter.  Doing something nice and unexpected for somebody else doesn’t always require money, and often the gesture has more meaning when it doesn’t. A good photograph of a special moment.  It transforms the moment into a tangible keepsake and helps make the memory of that moment last a lifetime. A rainbow breaking through the storm clouds on a calm, rainy summer afternoon. The exhilarating rush of adolescent love.  Those magical moments of adolescent lust and affection that only you and one other person rightly remember. The little kicks and pokes I feel daily as I enter the last month of my first pregnancy.  It’s truly remarkable! Sharing a good laugh with friends and family.  Some of the most memorable moments in my life have been moments spent in laughter. The excitement of swinging on a swing as high as you possibly can. The simple fact that I can read the sincerity in her eyes when she says, “I love you.” The awesomeness of skipping rocks across water.  It doesn’t matter how old I get, this one never gets old. The tears of joy that flow when you see your beloved for the first time after a 10 month deployment to Iraq.  All the months of struggle and loneliness are washed away the second he gets off that plane. The soothing comfort of an old familiar smell.  Earlier today pulled into my parent’s driveway after being away for over a year.  I could smell familiarity in the air – the scent of the pine tree in the neighbor’s yard.  And as I headed through the front door, more familiar smells consumed my senses.  Gosh, it feels good to be home. The keen wisdom my grandfather has acquired slowly over the course of 86 years, and the amazing stories and life lessons he shares with me every time I visit him. A first kiss.  The sweet rush of butterflies in your tummy when you kiss someone special for the very first time. When you look into the eyes of your best friend and know, without a doubt, that you can trust her.  You can see it in her eyes and you can feel it in your heart.  She has no ulterior motive. The first sight of daffodils poking through the snow after a long, hard winter. The realization of true love.  The warm feeling you get many years after your first kiss when you realize you married the right person. The surreal beauty of watching lightning strike in the distance. An unexpected compliment.  It seemed like just another dreary Monday morning, but when she walked into my office and said, “I love your shirt! That color looks great on you,” it brightened the rest of my day. A peaceful, romantic picnic with your significant other on a warm sunny day. The joy of telling an interesting true story.  One of the most enticing roles we lead in life is that of a storyteller.  There are few things more satisfying than telling a true story that others enjoy listening to. The feeling of self-confidence is unquestionably priceless. It cannot be purchased with money, but it can buy you more opportunities and take you farther than any amount of money ever could. The excitement of a white Christmas. A pillow fight with two of your best friends. When my cat snuggles up on my chest while I’m laying on my back.  He’s so warm and fuzzy and cute. Grilled steak and potatoes home-cooked for me by my husband on a lazy Friday night after I’ve had a long week.  Nothing beats sitting at home in my pajamas and eating my favorite food, made by the man I love, with the man I love.When the song on the radio ends right as you pull into the driveway.If you enjoyed these simple pleasures and priceless moments, be sure to check What Money Cannot Buy

Improvement|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/how-to-reprogram-yourself.jpg?resize=500%2C324&ssl=1|‘How To Reprogram Your Mind For Self Improvement’ is a guest post written by Justin.One of the most fulfilling things a person can do is take some kind of action that causes them to improve in a certain area of their life.  Think about this from your own perspective for a second.  Remember a time when you accomplished something that proved you had become better?For me, when I first began my entrepreneurial career, one of my goals was to be a professional speaker.  Despite how nervous I would get before a talk (mostly due to a total lack of experience), I got out and started speaking.  I was mediocre at best.  But I kept trying, learning, studying and practicing.  When the opportunity came to speak to a huge group of new university students, I delivered my most confident and inspiring talk to date.  I still remember the rush of excitement at the end of the talk when a bunch of the students lined up to speak to me and ask me questions at the end.  I knew I had taken a step in the right direction.  The real win: I was improving and it was an awesome feeling!For the past 3 years, I have spent most of my time developing my business and implementing as many self improvement ideas as humanly possible.  What I realized along the way was that I was not merely improving, but I was actually reprogramming my mind to get rid of old habits and beliefs and instill new, more empowering ones.So here are 7 techniques that will help you reprogram your mind to create a new and improved you:Study the work of a role model.Find someone who is already living and producing results at a level you admire and aspire towards.  They could be an author, speaker, actor, blogger, professor, etc.  The key is to study these people.  Read books or articles they have written a number of times.  Study their mannerisms when they speak or perform.  Notice the way they carry themselves publicly.Ultimately, the goal here is to understand how they think so that you can emulate the same kind of thinking in your life.  I’m not saying you should try to be like the person, because we are all unique and we need to celebrate our uniqueness.  Rather, I am suggesting that you figure out the intangibles that made this person so admirable to begin with and incorporate those intangibles into your own behavior.Learn to trust the sound of your own voice.There are more than enough self improvement books that talk about the power of affirmations.  I am not here to argue the validity or the science behind affirmations.  What I will say is that from my own personal experiences, when you repeat a set of instructions to yourself over and over again, you eventually start to believe your own voice.Here is a quick process you can follow to create your own digital affirmations that you can use in your own reprogramming process.Write out a description of your ideal outcomes in all the various areas of your life.  This can include business, financial, relationship, health, etc…Record your voice reading these statements with as much feeling and belief as possible.Use software like Garageband to overlay some relaxing or new age style music faintly in the background.Export as an mp3 file and listen to it on low volumes as you work, exercise, sleep or during any activity where you feel it works for you.For the analytic people out there, you cannot measure the benefit of this exercise directly but I will say from personal experience that it has been a technique I have used to help achieve a number of my more difficult, longer-term goals.Hang out with an influencer.I think most people buy into the idea that we become a product of our environment.  What better way to reprogram yourself for improvement than spending time with someone who inspires you.  When I first got started in business, I was struggling to pay the bills and find enough clients to keep me going.  Even when I did find clients, I did a terrible job billing for my time and I was not recognizing my own value as a service provider.I was lucky enough to meet another business owner who had built a number of successful companies and had already been through all of the tough business lessons that I had yet to be exposed to.  Over time we became friends and I was able to absorb an incredible amount of information about business, mindset, dealing with clients, social skills, etc. – all of the things that made him so talented at business.The challenge here is that you can’t just walk up to someone and ask them to be your friend.  It is tough enough to find a decent influencer, but when you do, you have to make sure that you take interest in them and express your desire to learn from them.  At the same time, show them that you value their time and bring something of your own to the table.  If they feel they can also learn from you and your life experiences, they will be far more willing to hang out with you.Wage a war against the crybaby in your head.Have you ever had an idea that totally captivated your imagination and inspired you to think about a life far beyond the one you are living today?  If so, were you also among the majority of people who had that cynical, crybaby, negative voice pop up and immediately tell you all the reasons why this new idea could never come true?Instead of falling victim to this defeating voice, try turning the tables.  Picture that voice as a vicious enemy trying to steal your life, power and happiness away from you.  Challenge the voice.  Question its authenticity.  Question its reasoning.  Get pissed off if you have to.  Make it powerless against your will.Realize that you have the choice to replace that voice with a more encouraging, faithful and friendly one.  A voice that will consider your goal as not just a possibility, but a probability.  A voice that does not look externally for validation before taking action, but rather uses self belief as its driving force.  A voice that realizes that any person who has ever achieved greatness had to do so against similar odds and that all things are possible to those who commit to their vision.Use new relationships to develop a new persona.When you meet someone for the first time, they have absolutely no idea what you are like to hang out with.  If you have been shy and timid your whole life, the best time to come out of that shell is when you meet someone new.  If you are at a networking event and someone walks up to introduce themselves, your old self may have quietly shook their hand and looked down in embarrassment.  Why not use the opportunity to develop a new persona?Instead of being shy and timid, greet the person with a big smile.  Look them in the eye and project your voice with confidence as you say your name.  Have an interesting question prepared that immediately gets the person engaged.  Instead of asking what they do for a living (the standard), ask them what their favorite restaurant is or ask them about a hobby they are passionate about.  Let their enthusiasm to share their passion enhance your confidence level and energize your own enthusiasm.If you practice this often enough, you will eventually become that new person and you no longer have to practice.  It will be who you ARE!Acquire a competitive edge.I don’t know about you, but when I am put in a position where I’m competing against one or more people, my motivation shoots up to a whole new level.  I have talked to many others who experience the same.When you compete against someone, in any area of life, you setup two incredibly powerful forces.The first is the desire to be triumphant.  Imagine the excitement someone must feel when they win a gold medal in the Olympics.  They have achieved a personal dream and they get a flood of recognition from friends, family, media, fans and ultimately their entire country.  What person would not love this kind of validation of success?  The same kind of triumph can be experienced (maybe not at the same level of intensity) when you win a competition that you have been involved in, no matter how small it may be.The second (and more powerful) force that gets created in competition is the desire to avoid defeat.  Most humans instinctively associate any form of loss with pain and in most cases, will do anything necessary to avoid that pain.  If you enter some kind of competition that will help drive you towards your goals, this pain avoidance force may be the deciding factor in your success.Use competitive scenarios to drive you forward but remember to detach from the outcome.  If you happen to lose your competition, don’t get down in the dumps.  Focus on what positives came out of it (usually a drastic increase in results) and continue moving towards your goals.Get up early and invest this extra time in yourself.Our minds are the most calm and open to influence when we first wake up.  As the day goes on, we get busier and the number of demands and requests increase.  Most of us in today’s society are extremely busy trying to balance work, family, social life and so on.  It is very easy to get to the end of a day and still have a pile of items on your to do list that did not get completed.Early morning is an ideal time to create some personal time for your own development.  Unless you are in a job that forces you out of bed at 5am, you probably have no obligations at that time of day.  Instead of sleeping until the last possible minute, try getting up an hour or even two hours earlier than you have been.Use this time to appreciate the stillness of the world.  Get into a headspace of clarity and focus on what you are trying to create for your life.  Study empowering books and self development training programs.  Write out your goals.  In essence, do whatever you can to condition your mind so that you are creating the ideal life for yourself.By the time the rest of the world is waking up, you will have already invested more time in yourself than most people will for a month.  The energy you get from doing this can carry you through the rest of your day and you will be in a much more productive frame of mind.For the past few months, I have been starting my day just after 5am.  This video shows some of the things I do to get ready for my day.  Maybe it will give you some ideas:Do you use any of these techniques?  Do you have some of your own that have made a major impact on your life?  I would love to hear from you in the comments below.Also, I highly recommend these best selling self improvement books:Eat That Frog!: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less TimeFocal Point: A Proven System to Simplify

"What We Have Been Searching For All Along|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/searching-for-all-along.jpg?resize=500%2C334&ssl=1|Far From PerfectAbout a year ago on his 30th birthday, after spending his entire adult life loosely dating different women, he suddenly decided he was ready to settle down.  He wanted to find a real mate… a lover… a life partner – someone who could show him what it meant to be in a deep, monogamous, trusting relationship.So he searched far and wide.  There were so many women to choose from, all with great qualities, but none with everything he was looking for.  And then, finally, just when he thought that he would never find her, he found her.  And she was perfect.  She had everything he ever wanted in a woman.  And he rejoiced, for he knew how rare a find she was.  “I’ve done my research,” he told her.  “You are the one for me.”But as the days and weeks turned into months and years, he started to realize that she was far from perfect.  She had issues with trust and self-confidence, she liked to be silly when he wanted to be serious, and she was much messier than he was.  So he started to have doubts – doubts about her, doubts about himself, doubts about everything.And to validate these doubts, he subconsciously tested her.  He constantly looked around the apartment for things that weren’t clean just to prove that she was messy.  He decided to go out alone to parties with his single guy friends just to prove that she had trust issues.  He set her up and waited for her to do something silly just to prove that she couldn’t be serious.  It went on like this for awhile.As the tests continued – and as she, clearly shaken and confused, failed more and more often – he became more and more convinced that she was not a perfect fit for him after all.  Because he had dated women in the past who were more mature, more confident, and more willing to have serious conversations.Inevitably, he found himself at a crossroads.  Should he continue to be in a relationship with a woman who he once thought was perfect, but now realizes is lacking the qualities that he already found in the other women that came before her?  Or should he return to the lifestyle he had come from, drifting from one empty relationship to the next?Every Light Casts A ShadowWhen he showed up at my door this evening looking for answers, this is what I told him:One of the greatest lessons we get to learn in life is that we are often attracted to a bright light in another person.  Initially, this light is all we see.  It’s so bright and beautiful.  But after awhile, as our eyes adjust, we notice that this light is accompanied by a shadow – and usually a fairly large one.When we see this shadow, we have two choices: We can either shine our own light on the shadow or we can run from it and continue searching for a shadowless light.If we decide to run from the shadow, we must also run from the light that created it.  And we soon find out that our light is the only light illuminating the space around us.  Then, at some point, as we look closer at our own light, we notice something out of the ordinary.  Our light is casting a shadow too.  And our shadow is a bigger and darker than some of the other shadows we’ve seen.If, on the other hand, instead of running from the shadow, we decide to walk towards it, something amazing happens.  We inadvertently cast our own light on the shadow, and likewise, the light that created this shadow casts its light on ours.  Suddenly, both shadows begin to disappear.  Not completely, of course, but every part of the two shadows that are touched by the other person’s light illuminate and disappear.And as a result, we each find more of that bright beautiful light in the other person – which is precisely what we have been searching for all along.Photo by: Antony Chammond 20 Tips That Could Save Your Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/20-tips-save-your-life.jpg?resize=500%2C335&ssl=1|’20 Tips That Could Save Your Life’ is a guest post written by Diggy.When your life is in jeopardy, nothing else matters.Personal safety is not a topic I see many bloggers writing about, yet it’s a vital topic to the wellbeing of our lives.  Simply put, your health and safety form the foundation for everything else you do.  Maintaining this foundation must come before wealth, success, happiness, and almost every other aspect of self improvement and personal growth.As you might expect, preparation is the key.  Often there are many simple habits and observations a victim could have followed to prevent themselves from becoming a victim.  And sadly, in many cases, these simple habits and observations could have saved their life.Remember, there’s a big difference between being scared and being prepared.  I am not, nor would I ever suggest you live so cautiously that you scare yourself out of trying new things and seeing new places.  I am simply suggesting that, like a boy scout, you adequately prepare yourself before doing so.Let Someone Know Where You Will Be – When you live alone or even when you go out for the night, let a friend know where you will be.  This barely takes any effort on your part, and if something does go wrong or you are not back in the morning, somebody will know where to start if they have to look for you.Keep Doors and Windows Locked – I am always amazed at people who leave all the entryways to their house wide open when they are home, let alone when they go to sleep at night.  Although it’s nice to believe that nobody would violate your space while you’re in it, there are, unfortunately, a lot of bad people in the world who would love to take advantage of your naive, overly trusting habits.  Why risk being robbed or attacked in your own home when all you have to do is adopt the habit of locking your door after you go through it?Have An Exit Strategy – Do you know exactly what you would do if you woke up to a raging fire in your house?  What if there was a sudden earthquake?  What if you are driving on a dark country road and you realize someone suspicious is clearly following you?  By going over these scenarios in your head you can come up with plans and strategies to mitigate the inherent dangers.  The more you think and plan now, the less thinking and planning you’ll need to do in a moment’s notice.Always Be Prepared For The Unexpected – Never, ever be so humble as to think that something cannot happen to you.  There are simple things you can do to prepare for unfortunate events.  For example:  Keep your cell-phone charged and always have some credits so that it is available for an emergency call when needed.  Keep some spare money in a hidden place (in your car?) in case you get robbed or lose your wallet.  Program emergency phone numbers into your phone because when you’re in shock or in a panic, you will not always be able to think straight.Learn A Martial Art – Physical confrontation is always a last resort, but if push comes to shove, you better be able to defend yourself.  I suggest Muay Thai for guys and Aikido for girls.  Besides the fact that they are both good forms of self defense, they are also fun ways to exercise.  This (and this) is an awesome guide for simple and effective self defense.  You do not need to study martial arts for years to learn and apply some decent self defense moves.  More often than not, the assailant will be male.  Attack the weak spots on his body: The eyes, nose, throat, solar plexus, groin, knees, etc.  A well-aimed strike or blow to one of these areas could instantly neutralize the attacker.Carry Pepper Spray – Pepper Spray (or Mace) is an awesome self-defense product.  It comes in a little pressurized spray can and one little spray of the substance in an attacker’s eyes will immobilize them for nearly 15 minutes.  It is legal in most countries, very cheap, and it can save your rear end in a hostile situation.Buy a Small Keychain Weapon – Get a Stinger or a Kubaton.  These tiny weapons will easily fit onto your keychain, and if you ever need to defend yourself in a moment’s notice they will give you a significant advantage over just using your hands and fists.Be Extra Cautious At Night – Do not stop at gas stations or quick marts late at night if anything looks suspicious or if the area is not well lit or supervised.  If you must stop, keep a safe distance from the car in front of you so you have plenty of room to drive away in an instant.  Do not walk along streets late at night by yourself or even with friends.  Darkness usually invites trouble.Observe Emergency Exits – Just like always having an exit strategy, it is important to know where the emergency exits are when you are in a public location.  The more crowded the location, the more important it is that you know where they are.  An example of this was back in the early 2000’s with a New Years Eve party at a night club in a small Dutch town called Volendam.  The emergency exits were blocked off, the club was packed with partygoers and a fire broke out.  There was a panic and people could not get out easily, the result being that many people were seriously injured.Never Trust Strangers – Never, ever trust strangers.  I know, it is sad but true.  You simply cannot trust someone you do not know.  I am rather trusting in nature, but I am very cautious when trusting somebody with any important aspect of my life who has not previously proven their trustworthiness to me.  This includes people who claim to be police, firemen or other officials.  Always ask them for identification or proof to support their position.Trust Your Intuition – If an environment or situation feels wrong, listen to your intuition (or gut-feeling).  Our subconscious mind can often determine when something is not quite right way before we can consciously determine why we have that feeling.  It’s smarter to be cautious than careless.Don’t Flaunt Your Wealth – If you are well-off and possess what others desire, do not be arrogant about it and flaunt it every chance you get.  This is just asking for trouble.  Of course you can and should enjoy the fruit of your hard-earned labor, but try to do it in a way attracts less attention and is respectful of others who are less fortunate.Ask For Help When You Need It – Don’t be scared to ask or scream for help if you think you need it.  Wouldn’t you rather risk looking like an idiot than trying to be brave and ending up hurt or worse?Don’t Get Intoxicated In Strange Places – Sometimes people like to get a little drunk, sometimes very drunk,  and this fine as long as you are in a safe place.  But do not get too drunk in unfamiliar places where it is not safe (where there are people you do not know like public locations, clubs and parties at other people’s houses).Avoid Deserted Places – When you go out alone, try to avoid deserted places.  Sure, deserted places can seem calm and peaceful, but criminals and bad guys always look for easy targets, and someone who is alone in a place where there are no witnesses or people to help out is an easy target.  If you do go out alone, always let someone know where you will be and have some sort of weapon with you (pepper spray is a pretty good option).Fight or Flight – It sounds pretty simple, because what other choices do you have, right?  Wrong!  Many people freeze up due to shock or adrenaline when they encounter a hostile situation.  And this is obviously the worst thing you can do.  Even black-belt martial artists who are really good in the dojo can become totally paralyzed when confronted with a real fight on the street.  You need to make the decision in your head and prepare yourself for intense hostile situations.  Either you run and get away (usually the best option), or if you have no other choice, you fight and you fight without hesitation and with everything that you’ve got.Get a Dog – If you like animals and have the means to care for one, get yourself a dog.  It doesn’t have to be a big vicious dog either.  Most dogs, even small ones, will alert you when they hear unusual sounds around them.  Attackers are also far less likely to mess with you if you have a dog walking beside you.Be Careful With Your Personal Details – Be careful to who you give your personal information to (name, number, address, work, credit card, etc).  This applies in real life and also on the internet.  Unfortunately, in today’s world there are lots of weirdos and criminals who try to lure people into giving them their personal details so they can steal their identity and take advantage of them in other ways.Vary Your Routine – Try not to follow the same exact routine every single day.  If you leave and come home at exactly the same times or stop in the same spot or visit the same restaurant at certain times, criminals may pick up on this and target you as a potential victim.Take Action When You Are Being Followed – If you think you are being followed, cross the road.  If you need to, do this a few times.  If this confirms your suspicion, go into the nearest public place and phone the police.  If you are in a car, first confirm your suspicion by turning into a few different roads.  If you know you are being followed, drive to the nearest police station.  If someone wants you to pull over on a dark or deserted road and he looks like some sort of official or police officer but is not in an official police car, rather be safe and drive to the nearest police station.Do you have any additional personal safety tips?  I’d love to hear about them in the comments section below.Diggy writes all about self improvement and

Rosen How To Avoid The Personal Development Plateau|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/personal-developement-plateau.jpeg?resize=500%2C252&ssl=1|How To Avoid The Personal Development Plateau was written by Ross Hudgens, author of Authentic Marketing.What’s your specialty?  How long have you been doing it?When you started learning this specialty, your growth cycle was dramatic.  Every article you read brought on new insights.  When you practiced, implementation ingrained the information quickly in your head.  Repetition allowed you to find new ways to improve the process, and eventually, somewhere along that cycle, you hit the 90% completion rate of absolute expertise.Then, the path to 100% learning slowed.  You burrowed in and spent tireless hours, but most of the time you spent working brought little improvement.  Whether or not you were internally aware of this is irrelevant – it nonetheless happened.Immediate, quick growth is a reaction for any new field, but similarly, a plateau of improvement is always reached.  At this point, you’ll have to put in hundreds of hours to squeak out the next improvement up the percentage scale, and even if you do, the time invested may not be worth the improvement gained.This happens everywhere, but similarly, most people never act on it.  If you’re in a job working the same position for 3 years, there’s a good chance your learning has all but halted.  You have to get out.  Your growth depends on it.Why You Should Come Up ShortHow about those people who spend tireless hours in the gym?  You can improve your body, sure, but to what point?  If you’re not a bodybuilder, the return on 2 hours in the gym every day hits a ceiling.  When you’re around your “perfect body”, your time should be shifted down to maintain, because your body has little room left for improvement, and the time spent to reach that improvement isn’t worth the investment back in.Technology has changed things.  Before, your career might have called for a single investment towards the 100% goal.  However, as more and more career fields become commoditized and there’s increased room for “linchpins”, those who can expend emotional labor, solve problems, and do what can’t be measured, every business needs a “90%er”.In small companies, it’s intensely important to be able to wear multiple hats.  Instead of wasting countless hours researching your field after you’ve hit that 90%, pivot.  Your time invested will be much better spent, and your company and business will love you for it.How do I know when I’ve reached 90%?Now that you’ve put a name on it, you’ll be aware of it.  I especially respect Seth Godin for this – he puts names on the things that didn’t have them, and that allows us to face them and conquer.  This may be enough for the less OCD-enabled, but for those who want to realize the moment to enable a pivot, real tools exist.Track your productivity. – Rescue Time is a great program to track time measurement online.  You can associate productivity variables to various tasks, and from there, you have a real gauge on how you’re improving within each undertaking, at least from a speed point of view.Jump back. – Return to your past work. Look at the stuff you did six months ago.  How does it compare to now?  Four months?  Last month?  If the improvement hit a plateau at some point, you have strong evidence to support a development shift.Measure. – If you start measuring what you’re doing, you can start comparing.  If you can put a number on it, you have the gauge to quickly establish a plateau.  Buy a notebook.  Write everything down.  Be consistent.  Be careful in areas like weight lifting, though, as plateaus often occur in the natural growth cycle, and can quickly be burst through.Climb at Least One HillThere’s a need to be a 100%er in one area, at least initially.  It’s a marketing pull.  People buy specialties.  Jobs want experience.  Much of it, though, is just time commitment on the resume.  If you’re running a small web-based business for instance, do your job, get the experience that requires “doing”, but out of the office, stop worrying about the caveats of accounting vernacular or what 1% improvement you can make to your SEO technique.Your time would be much better spent developing programming knowledge, web design or marketing ability to create traffic (and accounting leads) in multiple ways.  There’s real value, now, in being a jack of all trades.  In this internet world, where accessibility is easier than ever, it’s the best way to improve your value, both in the workplace and as a person.Ross Hudgens is a marketer.  His primary responsibility involves driving traffic to some of the biggest websites on the Internet.  His secondary responsibility is writing about all of it on his blog Authentic Marketing.  For additional information like this, subscribe to his feed or follow him on Twitter here. Only the Sound of People Thinking|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/sound-of-people-thinking.jpg?resize=500%2C301&ssl=1|Creating a LifeThe head chef at my favorite local diner was once a mobster.  The first time I ate there he showed me the scars on his chest, arms, and back. Most of them were from his final night as a member of the mafia – a night that ended in a horrific battle with another mob group.  He was stabbed multiple times and then beaten mercilessly with a steel pipe.  Both of his lungs were punctured and a knife was lodged less than a centimeter from his heart.According to the paramedics, his heart stopped beating twice in the ambulance.  During those “outages,” he had out-of-body experiences.  He saw God, who told him that he wasn’t done living, that he had obligations to his family, and that it was time for him to turn his life around.He stayed in the hospital for almost six months.  When he was released, he immediately proposed marriage to his girlfriend, with whom he’d already had two children.  Days later, he moved all the way to the opposite end of the city, attended his first day of culinary school, and began creating a life devoted to peace and spirituality, his wife, and his two baby girls.A Free ManHe’d been cooking at the diner for ten years when I met him two years ago.  And although he’d chosen the culinary vocation simply because cooking was the only thing he thought he could do well, he quickly found out that it was also a great way to make a difference in people’s lives.  “I serve healthy, nutritious food everyday at reasonable prices,” he’d tell me.  “And this is the cleanest kitchen in town.  I take care of this place and my customers like I take care of my family.”Although the diner isn’t in the ghetto, it still isn’t in a best area of town.  Many of the kids who hang around there romanticize the mafia and gang cultures… until they meet him.  “It ain’t nothing to be proud of,” he’d tell the kids.  “Nothing!  So stay in school and out of trouble!”Yesterday I went to the diner for lunch, like usual, but he wasn’t behind the counter.  I asked his assistant chef where he was, but he just looked towards the floor with a despondent expression on his face.  When I asked again, the diner’s only busboy came out from the back and said, “He was arrested for something he did fifteen years ago.  It’s really unfair and messed up.  We don’t think he’ll ever be a free man again.”The Whole StoryProsecutors love cases like the one he’s up against.  DNA evidence, a weapon, and multiple witnesses willing to corroborate their story (other ex-mod members already in jail, whom the country judge offered reduced sentences to if they agreed to cooperate).But what if the facts surrounding the crime for which he was implicated weren’t the only facts that mattered?  What if those facts told a story, but not the whole story – not most relevant or truthful story about the human being in question?The truth is, his father was in the mafia.  So were his three uncles, two older brothers, and most of the grown men he grew-up around.  As a young boy, as far as he knew, there was no alternative lifestyle.  “I was born into a war.  I started dodging bullets the day I learned to walk,” he once said on a quiet Tuesday afternoon.  “And that’s not some glamorized CNN bulls**t!  That lifestyle, my life, was always a part of a f**king war!”Yet despite growing up in a war zone (which, by the way, happens to be a thirty-minute drive from one of the most affluent zip codes in the United States), and knowing no alternative, he managed to get his act together, become a productive member of society, and most importantly, become a positive influence to all the young people around him.GuiltyToday I went back to the diner for some lunch and learned that he was facing a life sentence without the possibility of parole.  “They put an innocent man behind bars,” his assistant chef said.  But it sort of seemed like an absurd statement.“We all know he’s guilty,” the busboy retorted. Some of the other regular customers in the diner nodded their heads in agreement.“Screw that!  Society is f**king guilty!” his assistant chef exclaimed, hands shaking, jaw quivering. “Cause he’s still the most innocent, compassionate man I know!”He waited for a response.  But there was none.Only the sound of people thinking.Photo by: Tom Conger 30 Ways To Live A Life Of Excellence|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/30-ways-excellence-in-life.jpg?resize=500%2C377&ssl=1|30 Ways To Live A Life Of Excellence was written by Celestine.I’ve always been passionate about living a life of excellence.  Setting goals, overcoming challenges, getting results, celebrating the victories – these make living so rich and worthwhile.When I was in college I was on the Dean’s List – an honorary roll awarded only to top students – in every academic year I was there.  When I graduated I was selected from over 1,000 applicants to enter a Fortune 100 company – one of the top 100 companies in the world recognized by Fortune.  Then when I quit to pursue my passion a year and a half ago, I started The Personal Excellence Blog to share my best advice to achieve excellence in life.In the last year and a half I also founded my training school where I coach and train others to achieve excellence.  Life has never been more rewarding.  That being said, I have determined that excellence itself is a way of life, not a destination.  While I’ve made some accomplishments, I’m nowhere near where I envision myself to be in the future.  There’s always room for personal growth.  Our potential is limitless, and it’s up to us to tap into it.Here are my top 30 ways to live a life of excellence:Discover your purpose. – Our physical life started when we were born.  Our real life starts when we discover our purpose.  What is your purpose?  What is your mission statement for your life?  Mine is, “To touch others’ lives, help them achieve their highest potential and live their best lives.”  This one statement gives me clarity and focus on what to do, from my daily plans to my long-term goals.Follow your passion. – To do what you love is truly the only way to live.  Don’t just pursue as a hobby; turn it into your career.  I didn’t use to be a personal development blogger or a coach.  I was a marketing major and I was working in brand management as a career.  However, it wasn’t my passion.  So a year and a half ago, I quit my regular job to pursue my real passion.  Despite having no experience in the personal development industry, I slowly carved my niche in this area and established myself and my expertise.  Today I’m pursuing my passion as a career, and loving it.Set your goals. – If you can have whatever you want, what would you like?  What are your biggest goals and dreams?  Set them.  The life I’m living today is a result of goals I set in the past.  If you don’t set any goals, it’s safe to say that you’ll be running in place for the foreseeable future.  Is that what you want?Create a life handbook. – A life handbook is a concept I created where you have a book to write your life purpose, goals, dreams, plans, values, mottos, and other things that are important to you as you pursue your best life.  I started my life handbook in 2007 and it has been my #1 tool to living my life to the fullest.  Learn more about my life handbook and how to create yours.Have the right mindset. – The quality of your life is determined by the quality of your thoughts.  If you think life sucks, life will indeed suck.  On the other hand, if you are set to live your best life, the paths will open up in front of you.  Maybe it’s all the ‘good triumphing over evil’ RPGs I’ve played since young, but I firmly believe that where there’s a will, there’s a way.  No one can stop you if you have the right mindset.Create your bucket list. – A bucket list is a list of things to do before you die.  All of us are going to die one day.  What are all the things you want to do/see/say/experience before you die?  It can be seeing the world, living your dreams, going skydiving, falling in love, among countless others.  I created my bucket list last year with over 100 things, and every day I accomplish what’s on it and add new things I want to do.  Here’s a list of 101 Things To Do Before You Die for ideas on what to put in your bucket list.Get mentors. – You have dreams and big visions, and there are people who have likely been there and done that.  Get them to mentor you.  It’ll definitely cut down the learning curve and ease your journey.  With a mentor, you can unlock your potential and achieve so much more.Stop worrying so much. – The majority of our fears exist only in our head.  Get rid of them and spend the energy on something productive.Get closer with your parents. – Many of us only have functional relationships with our family.  Some of us might even have estranged family relationships.  I know I used to have that, then I realized it was foolish.  Our parents went through a lot of hardship by bringing us up, and no one’s ever going to share a connection to us the way they do.  Today I’m much closer to my parents than I was in the past, and I’m grateful for that.Let go of negative friendships. – If you have friends who discourage you and pull you down, it’s time to get rid of them.  Getting rid might be too harsh for some, so distancing is a good alternative.  I had several negative friends in the past, then I just reduced contact.  Instead of wasting time and energy resisting them, I was then able to focus my energy on people and things that make me happy.Surround yourself with positive people. – Do you know you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with?  Your attitudes, beliefs, accomplishments and success are a function of the people you spend time around.  Think about the people who inspire you and spend more time with them.  You’ll be amazed at the effects they’ll have on you.Release your limits. – They say the sky is the limit.  I disagree.  We are our own limits.  It’s then about releasing our limits so we can live our best lives.  What are you limiting yourself from doing?  Stop holding yourself back.  Go out and get what you want.Believe in yourself. – The majority of the times I’ve been able to achieve something is because I started out believing I could do it, rather than acquiring that belief after I achieved it.  If I didn’t think I could do it, I probably would never have succeeded.  My past experiences have taught me that all you need to have in order to succeed is to have a sense of self-belief – a sense that you can control your own future.  That’s all.Wake up early. – I used to wake up late every day, like 9-10am.  I never thought much about waking up early until a couple of years ago.  After I switched to waking early at 5am, my days have been incredible.  I feel more productive, I get more done, I’m more eager to work to keep the momentum going.  It’s something you have to try yourself to know the difference.Eat a healthy diet. – A healthy diet just-starts a life of excellence.  What’s in your daily diet?  Junk?  Fast food?  Fried food?  Or healthy, nutritious food?  Fruits?  Vegetables?  I’ve been a vegan since 2008 and have been loving it.  While I tried it out as just a 30-day trial, I immediately saw the benefits of being a vegan and stayed the course ever since.  Also read: 9 Timeless Nutrition Tips for Any AgeExercise regularly. – Aside from a regular gym routine, try other sports to spice it up your workouts.  Frisbee, badminton and swimming are some of my favorite sports.  These make exercising a lot more fun.Plan your days. – Do you plan your days?  Did you wake up today knowing what you are supposed to do today?  If not, maybe it’s time you do.  Planning doesn’t have to be long and tedious, it can just be a 30 second process.  Every night, think about a few small things that you want to accomplish tomorrow and write them down.  When you wake up the next morning, review this list before you do anything else.Nurture those whom you love. – The magical feeling of love.  The fluttering of your heart.  The internal smile you get when you think of those who you care for most.  It’s impossible to live a life of excellence without sharing quality time with those whom you love.Try something new. – Routines stagnate us.  New experiences help us grow and they make life interesting.  Make an effort to try something new every week.  I get very invigorated whenever I’m doing something new.  It can be a whole new activity or just a small experience, such as talking to a stranger.Stop watching TV. – Why stop watching TV?  The bulk of content on TV is consciousness lowering.  TV has been proven by research to be linked with lower life satisfaction.  TV ads motivate you spend more money frivolously.  TV wastes lots and lots of time.  I could go on forever.  I quit regular TV watching almost 5 years ago and never looked back.  I recently wrote an article on my blog called 10 Reasons To Stop Watching TV and found out a good number of my readers dropped TV in their lives as well.  Try it out for 21-days and see how you feel.  Be sure to read: Top 10 Reasons You Should Stop Watching TV  and 40 Positive Effects of a TV Free Week.Stop obsessing over the news. – A lot of news today resonates with fear, guilt, shame and hate.  Depending on your news source, many are largely sensationalized and biased as well.  You don’t need to watch the news every day for an hour to know that there are car accidents, murders and wars out there.  Focus your energy on how you can address those problems instead.Don’t be trapped by dogma. – Don’t feel compelled to follow others all the time.  Pave your own path.  Follow your heart.  Don’t fall into the trap of operating on everyone’s whim.  Listening is okay, but doing what everyone wants is simply unhealthy.  Execute the good feedback and follow your vision.Be compassionate. – Show love and kindness to all the people around you.  Respect everyone.  They may not react in a kind way immediately, but they will notice and appreciate your kindness. To love is to be human.Smile more. – It takes more muscles to frown than to smile.  So let’s smile more often.  🙂Criticize less, appreciate more. – Do you like overly critical people?  I’m sure you don’t.  They are a dread to be around.  So let’s be less critical.  Don’t stare so hard at what’s missing.  Learn to see and appreciate what’s there instead.Keep a journal to self-reflect. – I had a paper journal for several years, but after I started The Personal Excellence Blog I use the blog as my journal.  By having a place to freely let out our thoughts and ponder over them, we get a lot more clarity about ourselves.  If you are not sure where to start with, try 50 Questions That Will Free Your Mind, 20 Questions You Should Ask Yourself Every Sunday and check out the new site Thought Questions.Forgive those who hurt you. – To forgive is to let go of a prisoner and to realize that the prisoner all along was you.  Don’t hold on to past hatred.  Let it go.  You’ll find new, wonderful things entering your life once you do.Enrich your mind great books. – Books contain concentrated volumes of wisdom.  It’s not surprising then that most knowledgeable people are also very well-read.  Check out 40 Modern Nonfiction Books Everyone Should Read and 30 Books Everyone Should Read Before Their 30th Birthday.Coach someone. – There’s no better way to learn than to teach others.  Is there someone who can benefit from your help?  Offer to coach them for free.  It’ll be an enlightening experience for both of you.Meet new people. – Most humans have a habit of stagnating in a small circle of friends.  But it doesn’t help us grow.  Get out there and meet new people.  You’ll be surprised at the lessons they will teach you and the new opportunities they will inject into your life.In case you can’t get enough, here are some related posts:How To Be The Best You Can Be (My guest post last year)How To Live Life77 Keys to Living Well Before You Die Act now.  We only live once.  Let’s live our lives in excellence.Celestine Chua writes at The Personal Excellence Blog, where she shares her best advice on how to achieve personal excellence and live your best life.  Get her RSS feed directly and add her on Twitter @celestinechua.  If you like this article, you will likely enjoy one of her top articles: 101 Things To Do Before You Die.Photo by: Glacier Tim "

Kind|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/one-of-a-kind.jpg?resize=500%2C331&ssl=1|The Real ThingLast night I saw Donny at a house party near the beach.  He was wearing an Armani sports jacket and loafers while the rest of us wore shorts and sandals.  I thought his choice of apparel was interesting, because back when we lived together he didn’t even own a sports jacket or loafers.He also brought two bottles of Cristal (really expensive champagne) to the party.  It was the first time I’d ever seen Cristal – outside of hip-hop music videos.  Actually, the closest I’d come to seeing it was on my first date with Angel several years ago.  After a nice dinner, I ran to the liquor store, bought a bottle of Cristalino (a cheap sparkling wine), cut the ‘ino’ off the label, and tried to make her laugh.“Inventive,” she said, “Just not too smooth.”But this was the real thing.  And several party goers circled around Donny hoping to grab a glass before it was gone. “Just like old times, man,” Sam said to me. “Donny is still the life of the party!”Still So CrazyAfter the two bottles were gone, and people were again drinking Keystone Light (a cheap beer), I stood on the patio with Donny, Sam, and Chad – my old college buddies.“Do you remember that time when Donny got drunk and broke every lamp in our dorm?” Sam asked.  “We spent three whole nights studying and eating by candlelight until he bought us those ugly Victorian lamps he found at a garage sale.”Sam, Chad and I laughed at the recollection.  Back then, it was normal for Donny to spontaneously smash little things (like beer cans and plastic cups) when he was drunk.  But that night he went on a rampage.  And we owned a set of gaudy Victorian lamps for the next two years to prove it.Donny shook his head disapprovingly.  “Come on guys, not in front of my girlfriend,” he said, directing us with his eyes to the girl on his arm.  “I’ve moved on.  Respect me for that.”I looked at the girl gripping Donny’s arm.  Though she’d been with him all night, I hadn’t really noticed her, and she hadn’t said a word.  I looked at Donny and smiled, but I didn’t know what to say.  Sam and Chad were smiling too, but they didn’t know what to say either.  Luckily, Donny broke the awkward silence.  “Why don’t I get another bottle of Cristal out of the car,” he said. “Ya know… for old times sake.”“Yeah man, yeah!” Sam said. “You’re still so crazy!”Nostalgia and NegationWhen I got home last night I stayed up and thought about what happens to us as time passes.  We change.  And as we change, we grow and move toward new people and experiences, and we make decisions and judgments about the people and experiences that we move away from.We typically either choose to engage and move closer (nostalgia), or we choose to disengage and move farther away (negation).  Nostalgia isn’t good because we’re holding onto what’s no longer there.  But negation isn’t good either because we’re pretending that what was once there never existed.When we’re too close to something (nostalgia), we can’t see clearly.  Sometimes we even see things that aren’t there at all.  For example, Sam wanted to know Donny as he remembered him – a crazy party animal.  But the bottles of Cristal didn’t make Donny crazy, they made him high-priced.  Donny had long since stopped being the party animal we all knew in college.When we’re too far away from something (negation), we can’t see it at all.  And we begin to lose a part of ourselves that can be a source of great happiness, understanding and direction.  For example, Donny had lots of good friends and experiences from his college years, and his girlfriend would have loved to share in them with him.  I know this because she told me before I left the party last night.ClarityClarity comes, I think, in being able to recognize the perils of both nostalgia and negation.  It’s simply about appreciating the past without trying to relive it, learning from the past without running away from it, and seeing people and experiences as they are in this moment – sometimes happy, sometimes sad, never perfect, always a one of a kind.Photo by: Gonzalo Ar How To Achieve Your Goals|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/how-to-achieve-your-goals.jpg?resize=500%2C375&ssl=1|‘How To Achieve Your Goals’ was written by Vincent, author of Health Money Success. So you have some goals, but you just can’t seem to achieve them.  You’re frustrated, right?  Well, why is it so hard?  Do only a few lucky people get to achieve their goals?  No…It’s all about creating a logical plan and executing it.There are three big reasons why people fail to achieve their goals:They never set achievable goals to begin with.They have no plan.They never take any sort of logical action.Do you think Steve Jobs and Bill gates were just lucky, or did they have a plan?  You better believe they had a plan – a long, long-term vision.  And then they worked hard and took a series of logical, actionable steps to achieve them.  They didn’t just ‘think it.’  They ‘did it.’You don’t try to build a wall. You don’t set out and say, “I’m going to build the biggest, baddest, greatest wall that has ever been built.” You say, “I’m going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid.”You do this every single day, and soon you have a wall.-Will SmithHow To Achieve Your GoalsOver the years I have achieved many of my personal goals.  And in all cases this is the methodology I used.  It’s tried and true, and I assure you, it can help you achieve your goals as well.  There are four basic steps:Set achievable goals.Strategize and plan.Take action.Review your progress regularly.Let’s go through them one at a time.Set Achievable GoalsWhen you are climbing the ladder, ensure thatyou are leaning against the right wall.You can climb the ladder as fast as you want, but it’s going to be a giant waste of your time if you get to the top and realize you’re leaning against the wrong wall.  You will need to get this step right to ensure that you are not wasting your efforts on goals that you do not truly want to achieve.  We as humans have a tendency to try to bite off more than we can chew, and this usually causes us to feel frustrated and annoyed.Because we only have a finite amount of time, it’s foolish to attempt to conquer the world in a day.  Yeah, you could set goals to be the best guitar player, basketball player, football player, lose weight, be financially savvy, earn $10,000 and join the public speaking club all at the same time.  But does that sound logical or achievable?  Not to me it doesn’t.  How can you excel at anything when you are juggling everything?So the first key is to figure out a few (1 to 3) things that you truly want.  And make sure you truly understand why you want these things.  Otherwise you’ll just lose interest.Strategize and PlanHere are the basic strategies you will need to employ to keep your motivation burning and your progress on track:A)  Paste up your goals where you can see them every day. – Without reminders, you will likely forget about your goals and become easily distracted by other stimuli.  So print them out 10, 20 or 30 times and paste them up in the most prominent, visible areas around your house, office, etc.B)  Create a visualization board. – For most of us, our mind sees the world in images and we remember images more clearly compared to text and numbers.  A visualization board is basically a large bulletin board filled with clear images of what you want to achieve.  This added visual stimulation can help invoke powerful emotions that will constantly drive your motivation.If you want to lose weight and get back down a few pants sizes, put an old photo of yourself up on the board.  If you want your blog to start making a thousand dollars a month, find a few success stories online of people that have achieved that goal and stick it up on the board.  You get the idea.  Position the board right next to your work area so you can see it while you work toward your goals.C)  Form a small mastermind group. – A mastermind group is your support group.  And believe me, this group is a vital entity to your success.  The group can consist of any amount of people (at least 2), but the important thing is that everyone in the group must share similar goals.  It doesn’t help much when you are trying to lose 30 lbs and other members in the group have goals of setting up their own company.A mastermind group helps to hold all its members accountable.  This will help you maintain consistency in taking action even when laziness gets the best of you.  Be sure to meet with your mastermind group at least once a week.D)  Create a daily action plan with actionable tasks. – Bullet points A, B and C help you to sustain the desire and motivation to achieve your goals.  This will ensure that you will not give up halfway though and fall backwards on your rear end.  But you also need a real, actionable plan that you can follow every day until you actually do achieve your goals.Every morning, brainstorm for tasks that will help to bring you closer to your goals and write them down.  Try to create three small actionable tasks each morning and complete them before you go to sleep.  Make them a priority and fit them into your schedule.  Whether you complete them or not makes a big difference in whether or not you will succeed.If you find it hard to generate the small daily tasks or an actionable plan that will bring you closer to your goals, seek out a mentor, search online, or purchase a book on goal setting.Here are three books I highly recommend:Eat That Frog!: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less TimeFocal Point: A Proven System to Simplify Your Life, Double Your Productivity, and Achieve All Your GoalsGetting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free ProductivityBreaking down your goals will help you avoid the feeling of being overwhelmed.  When you are creating your action plan, keep the short-term tasks in mind instead of obsessing over the long-term end result.  Obsessing over long-term results just creates stress.  It is far easier to think on a short-term task-related basis. And as long as you complete your tasks, the results will take care of themselves.  For instance, if you want to write a book, don’t obsess about completing the book (long-term results oriented), just focus on writing a page or two a day (short-term task-related) and soon you will have your book completed.E)  Set a deadline. – You will also need to set a deadline for your goal.  A long-term goal without a deadline will not instill any sense of urgency in you.  And defining a deadline also gives you something to look forward to.Take ActionThis step doesn’t need a long explanation.  Just take your daily action plan that we created above and DO IT!  More than anything, successfully achieving any goal hinges on the simple act of making a decision to absorb yourself fully in the process of getting things done – actually taking action.Review Your Progress RegularlyAn airplane goes slightly off its set course 70 to 80 percent of the time during an average flight, but the pilots always manage to land it in the exact location they intended.  How?  It’s quite simple.  Every time they go off course, they make a slight adjustment to correct it.Reviewing your goals regularly will help you to check your progress to determine if any adjustments are required. In addition, monitoring your progress will also likely motivate you to try even harder.  Whenever we see positive results, we have the tendency to take more action so we can see more positive results.Parting WordsThis article was inspired by one of the comments I recently received over on my blog.  It seems that people are often frustrated that they can’t stick to their goals and achieve the results they want in life.  I hope this article helps.  I would love to hear some feedback from you in the comments section below.  I’ll be sure to follow-up.  Cheers.Author’s Bio: Vincent writes about personal development over at Health Money Success.  His aim is to help people awaken the sleeping genius within them so they can achieve their desired success in life.  He has also created a free ebook called Unleash Your Maximum Potential.Photo by: James Jordan 10 Handy Travel Gadgets for Geeky Business Travelers|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/road-warrior-tools.jpg?resize=500%2C334&ssl=1|I’ve been racking up quite a few frequent flyer miles on business travel lately.  So today I figured I’d share some of the essential tools and gadgets from my road warrior toolbox.  These are the tools and gadgets I’ve come to absolutely rely on – the ones that make me more productive when I’m sky-riding at 35,000 feet, waiting in an airport lounge, or driving a rental car somewhere between here and there.  And since I’m a bit of a geek, the list certainly has a geeky twist to it.Travelpro Crew 7 Expandable Rollaboard Suitcase – Hey, if it was good enough for George Clooney in the movie ‘Up in the Air,’ it’s good enough for me.  But in all seriousness, I have gone through my fair share of luggage and this is the perfect suitcase for the hardcore road warrior.  It’s big enough to cram a week’s worth of clothing into and small enough to use as a carry-on.Cradlepoint CTR-350 Cellular Travel Router – The CTR-350 is a great mobile Broadband/Wi-Fi router.  It’s designed to use a mobile broadband data device (I’m using Sprint’s 595U) and provide access to it via Wi-Fi.  It works right out of the box in the default configuration, though you probably want to enable wireless security after testing it out, or else everyone will have access to it.Sprint Aircard 595U – Okay, so I figured I couldn’t make my CTR-350 recommendation in bullet #2 without also mentioning the awesome mobile broadband device I use with it.  I been through a few different mobile broadband devices over the last few years and this is by far my favorite.  It’s fast, reliable, and easy to configure.  It gives me endless hours of fast broadband access on the go, which is precisely what I require.  Note: My company also let me try the Sierra Wireless Overdrive Hotspot. And while cool in concept, it just doesn’t work as reliably as the CTR-350 and 595U do in combination.Apple iPad or Amazon Kindle – I know, I know… Why own both, right?  Well, I owned a Kindle for reading books and then I went out and bought an iPad for everything else.  The Kindle is still better for reading books, but the iPad is much more versatile.  I rarely take both with me on the road at the same time, but I always have one or the other.  It just depends on whether I think I’ll be doing more book reading or more online reading, tweeting, etc.MacBook Pro 13.3 Inch Laptop – It’s small, super quick, reliable, versatile… pretty much the best darn laptop I have ever owned.  And it looks sexy too.  If you don’t own a MacBook yet, you should consider giving this one a try.Kensington iPhone Battery Pack and Charger (and my iPhone) – The iPhone is a no-brainer.  But what’s the best accessory I’ve ever purchased for my iPhone?  Well, that would be the Kensington iPhone Battery Pack and Charger.  It’s compatible with the iPhone 3GS/3G/2G, some iPods, and any mobile device with a mini-USB connector.  I have charged my iPhone from empty to full with this life saving road warrior device many times.Dropbox – This online file storage service works flawlessly and is extremely easy to integrate.  It allows me to grab documents, presentations, custom scripts, etc. and view them on my iPad or Macbook on the go.  Dropbox also allows me to create public links to my files (even really large files) so I can share them with others via email or social media.Persol 2720 Sunglasses – Polarized crystal lens guaranteed to protect your eyes from the sun’s harmful rays wherever you are.  Oh, and James Bond wears them too.  So yeah, I feel ten times cooler when I have them on.Multi-Use Car Charger – Because a cell phone with no battery juice is useless when your rental car breaks down on the side of the road during a long road trip.  My multi-use car charger allows me to charge up to four devices at once.  This unit turns one auto cigarette lighter port into two, has two USB charging ports, and provides a heavy-duty 20 amp capacity.Small Moleskine Notebook – These days, almost all of my work is performed digitally on my Macbook or iPad, but when it comes time for a brainstorming session my Moleskine notebook is my tool of choice.  The analog nature of the Moleskine notebook and a ballpoint pen somehow sets my mind free when I need to grind out a few new ideas.  And it’s so ultra portable, I pretty much bring it with me wherever I go.What are some of the best travel gadgets and tools you’ve used recently?  Do you have any additional recommendations for us geeky business travelers?  Please share them with us in the comments.Photo by: Victor One Choice That Will Change Your Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/smartest-way-to-live.jpg?resize=500%2C331&ssl=1|The difference between fiction and reality?  Fiction has to make sense.-Tom ClancyThis evening I met a friend at a local bar.  She brought her laptop along so she could show me some of her latest digital art designs.  As we chatted and scrolled through her artwork, the laptop suddenly started making an unhealthy buzzing noise, then the screen flickered on and off and then cut off completely.  And as we both stared at one another in dismay, the funky smell of fried computer circuits consumed our nostrils.I grabbed the laptop off the bar to inspect it and the problem instantly revealed itself. The bottom of the laptop was soaking wet and an empty, spilt water glass rested against the side of her purse just behind where the laptop was sitting.  In the midst of us chatting and shifting the laptop’s 17 inch screen back and forth, we somehow spilt a glass of water that the bartender had inadvertently placed behind the screen, which was out of our view.When life throws us nasty curveballs like this, it typically doesn’t make any sense to us, and our natural emotional reaction might be to get extremely upset and scream obscenities at the top of our lungs.  But how does this help our dilemma?  Obviously, it doesn’t.The smartest, and oftentimes hardest, thing we can do in these kinds of situations is to be more tempered in our reactions.  To want to scream obscenities, but to be wiser and more disciplined than that.  To remember that emotional rage only makes matters worse.  And to remember that tragedies are rarely as bad as they seem, and even when they are, they give us an opportunity to grow stronger.Every difficult moment in our lives is accompanied by an opportunity for personal growth and creativity.  But in order to attain this growth and creativity, we must first learn to control our emotions.  We must recognize that difficulties pass like everything else in life.  And once they pass, all we’re left with are our unique experiences with each other and this crazy world, and the lessons we’ve learned along the way.Life is short.  Our thoughts steer our reality.  We already know this.  The choice is ours to make.Photo by: Gary "

It turns out cross-country running was the perfect sport for me.Joining my schools cross-country team was perhaps one of the greatest decisions I have ever made.  The sport took a kid who was lazy and unmotivated, and transformed him into a student of excellence.  While I still had my moments of laziness, my outlook on life drastically improved.One of the reasons cross-country was so beneficial for me was that our team was consistently one of the best teams in the nation.  So I was always surrounded by people who wanted to be extraordinary.At first, I actually didn’t want to be extraordinary.  I figured it was too difficult.  I simply put in enough work to be “average” and nothing more.  But as I began to see my teammates succeed, I thought, “Hey why not me?” The attitudes of my teammates quickly rubbed off on me and made me strive for more.One of my goals for freshman year was to run a mile in under 5 minutes – a respectable time for a high school runner.Having a clear goal in mind, I got motivated and began putting in the necessary work.  And I was getting closer and closer.  But then, out of nowhere, I became ill.An Unexpected SetbackCross country running is not the easiest of sports.  This is especially true when you’re running with one of the top running programs in the nation.  Our weekly mileage training requirements often exceeded 50 miles.  Running demands an extreme amount of time and energy in order to succeed.  And my body began to reject the training.One day during practice my legs became unusually sore.  But I initially assumed the soreness was just part of the sport, so I continued to run for a few days more.  Then during a light jog one afternoon I became light headed and fell to the ground.  My legs completely gave out.  And I realized then that something was seriously wrong with me.It turns out that my immune system was taxed to the point where it literally began eating the muscles in my legs.  For an entire week I could barely move my legs on my own.  Over the next several months I was in and out of hospitals taking test after test, trying to figure out what was wrong.  Although I was prescribed various medications, I never learned exactly what it was.And it took nearly six months before I began running again.5:01Coming back from such a large setback was extremely difficult to say the least.  Not only was I behind physically, but my mental game was off as well.  I was scared of pain.  I didn’t want to push myself because I feared that I might grow ill again.These negative thoughts impacted my ability to perform at the level I knew I was capable of.  So even though I started training again, I continued to fall short of my five minute mile goal.  But through the guidance and support I received from my family and friends, I was able to forge ahead.So I continued to dedicate myself to my goal.  When my sophomore track season began, I couldn’t have been more excited.  I was certain I was going to break five minutes on the opening race.But as it turns out, I didn’t.  Instead of breaking five, I ended up running a 5:01 in one of the greatest races of my cross-country career.  And although I didn’t conquer my goal, I still remember the feeling of joy that shot through my body – not because of the time, but because I knew without question that I gave it my all.Overcoming ObstaclesOur lives are naturally filled with obstacles.  It’s impossible to avoid them.  If you try, they will ultimately stop you from living.Your failures and shortcomings are a healthy part of your life’s story.  So embrace them.  Experience failure, learn from it, and breathe.  At the end of the day you have the final say on how you experience reality.Remember, the long road of falling short eventually leads to victory.  Because winning is simply the act of never quitting.Oh… And during the later part of my sophomore year, I finally ran a 4:54 mile.Bud Hennekes is dedicated to changing the way people think about themselves.

I do not play favorites, I do not grant extensions, and I do not grade on a curve.”One hand shot up “Is it true that less than half of your students pass?”“Yes, that’s true. Last semester out of 17 students, 5 earned a B or better. You are welcome to switch sections if you want.”Four of the students got up and left, but Albert, somewhat surprisingly remained. Albert was one of my students last semester. Last semester he wasn’t doing too well, and I told him he may be better off dropping the class – but he stuck it out to the end, and earned a D for his efforts.I spoke to him after class again today, and he assured me this semester was going to be different. He was determined to do better.Albert came in for office hours, frequently emailed me for help and struggled with the material. He did better, but continued to have difficulty with some of the same concepts he had struggled with the previous semester.In the end, things did turn out differently. Instead of a D, Albert had earned a C, when a B was required to continue to the next level. He would have to repeat Introduction to Computer Science for a third time.The Next SemesterThe following semester I had a batch of 15 students – Albert among them. I gave them the usual speech, a few switched sections, but Albert stayed in his seat. I puled him aside after class.“Albert, I hope you understand the situation. You could easily pass this class if you took a different section. You know that I grade strictly, I don’t accept late work, and I don’t grade on a curve. Are you sure you want to remain in my section – or would you rather switch?”“You know, I appreciate your concern Sid. I’ll think about it” he said.The next week he was back in class – my class. Albert was in my section to stay, but I wasn’t going to go easy on him just because it was his third time. In some ways, I was even harder on him. He was focused and tried hard, but he was no model student. His grades fluctuated from Ds to Bs, and I had to have the old mid-semester “Do you want to drop out?” talk with him once again. Once again, he opted to stay for the whole semester rather than take the incomplete.Finally, this was to be his semester – he barely earned his B. I was proud of him – and a bit relieved I wouldn’t have him repeating my class a fourth time.My Class GrowsAfter Albert made it out of my class, something interesting happened. A couple semesters later my section started to grow, and I soon had to turn people away because my section was full.Why would people continue to sign up for my section when they knew they I was a harsh grader, and they stood a better chance of passing in a different class? I asked them, and learned that Albert had recommended me. Apparently, he was doing well in the upper level courses and when people asked him why, he told them he had learned a lot from being my student.I had to go find out for myself what was going on.Why didn’t you just switch?I learned that Albert wasn’t just doing well in courses – he was now tutoring undergraduates in computer science. I caught up with him one day, and asked him for the full story.He told me that as classmates struggled in the higher level classes, he was so thankful I had been hard on him and forced him to really learn the introductory material without passing him along. By letting him struggle, when he actually passed my course he knew he was ready for the next level, and that confidence helped motivate him in future classes. Because I was so harsh on him in his introductory courses, it didn’t faze him when later professors were strict with deadlines, because he was already used to it.“I appreciate that, but you didn’t need three semesters to leaern that. Why didn’t you just switch sections your second semester instead of repeating my section over and over?” I asked him. “I gave you the chance to switch twice, and you know you could have passed in a different section.”“I know,” he said, ” but I needed to know that I had what it takes.”“If you can find a path with no obstacles,it probably doesn’t lead anywhere.”– Frank A. ClarkConclusionAlbert may have learned a thing or two about computer science from me, but I learned a valuable life lesson from him. He already knew the value of hard work and persistence, but having him as my student has taught me that when you expect the best out of people, they’ll give you their best. People don’t want to be coddled, and they don’t want rewards they don’t deserve.Just like Albert, many of us have the potential to accomplish great things, and will willingly struggle against obstacles time and time again.We struggle because we believe the journey is worth it.We struggle because we want to improve ourselves.We struggle because we know we have what it takes.Sid Savara is the author of Analysis Driven Personal Development, a blog where he discusses personal development, lifehacking and personal productivity.

And when I tried to say anything meaningful to Angel when we first met back in September of 2000, she would often laugh at me because she literally found herself trying to decode my jumbled, shaky sentences.ClarityOne of the most remarkable things about our lives is that clarity and progression occur with enduring love, passion, and patience.  This blog is now an easy topic for me to talk about… and now, it’s even easy for others to talk about, including my friends and family.  And although it may take her a second or two, Angel now gets the gist of my jumbled, shaky sentences almost immediately.And that makes me smile.  Because I want to continue to evolve and grow with the people and dreams that inspire me.  After all, I only have one shot – like we all do – to make this life meaningful.  And I know for sure, after coping with my fears on numerous journeys, that I would rather sound stupid…Than be stupid and take no action at all.Photo by: Darwin Bell "
"The Art of Forging Your Own Path|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/forging-your-own-path.jpg?resize=475%2C315&ssl=1|This guest post was written by Diggy, author of Upgrade Reality. No two people are identical, not even identical twins.  Everyone is a one-of-a-kind.  And do you know what a one-of-a-kind is worth?  Priceless!  Yes, this means YOU are priceless.From the day we are born and open our eyes, we start to grow into the person we will ultimately become as a result of the environment we are exposed to and the experiences we endure.  And although our parents and mentors have a large impact on our upbringing, we rarely walk the exact path they had in mind for us.There is only one success:  To be able to spend your life in your own way.– Christopher MorelyDon’t Be Someone Else’s PuppetContrary to the way many people behave, we do not have to do what other people tell us to do all of the time.  We are constantly under siege from family, friends, strangers and the media to act, behave and live in certain ways.  But despite all of these external influences, we have the ultimate choice to make our own decisions.Be True To Yourself“Be true to yourself or you aren’t true to anyone.”This is a powerful quote my mother told me a long time ago.  And whenever I make a decision I try to stick to it.  It is one thing to lie to other people, but it is much worse to lie to yourself.  Many people get into the habit of ignoring their true desires and instead they just do what they believe is expected of them by others.  I promise you, this path will only lead to failure on all fronts.Find and Follow Your Own ValuesIf you want to please somebody, be honest.  Do what they ask of you only when their values and expectations align with yours, and not because you merely want to impress them.   Do not study to be a lawyer because your parents have been telling you to since you were ten years old.  Instead, become a pilot, or an engineer, or whatever, because it’s your passion.  In other words, figure out what makes you tick and pursue it!Leave the Comfort of Your NestNever forget the definition of insanity:  Doing the same thing every day of every month of every year, and expecting different results.  If you want to truly live, and not merely exist, you have to leave the comfort of your nest.  You have to forge your own path through the uncharted waters around you – for it is these uncharted waters that will eventually lead you to the shores of your goals.Make Choices and Take RisksThe best way to forge your own path and live a life of fulfillment is to listen to your heart and overcome your natural fears.  You’ll never get to the place you want to be if you’re afraid to make the necessary choices to get there.Do not be afraid of what someone will think of you or say to you if you express your passion and tell them what you really want to do with your life.  Do not be afraid to make a choice that seems a little risky – everything in life, even getting out of bed in the morning, involves risk.  If you intend to live, you have to accept risks.ConclusionIt’s your life to live and your life to enjoy, no one else’s.  Nobody on this planet walks the exact same path as you, and this is precisely what makes life so remarkable and fun.  Although others may be able to show you parts of the path, you must take the initiative to walk it on your own.  Because as Morpheus said in The Matrix, “Neo, sooner or later you’re going to realize, just as I did, that there’s a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.”So stay true to yourself, follow your instincts, and listen to your heart every step of the way.Diggy is the author of UpgradeReality.com, a blog that explores the beauty and simplicity of self-improvement.  If you enjoyed this post then consider subscribing to his RSS feed.

midnight.  I didn’t answer.  Then it rang again a minute later.  I rolled over, grabbed the phone off the night stand, and squinted at the bright, glowing caller ID screen. “Claire,” it read.  Claire is a close friend – a friend who tragically lost her husband to a car accident six months ago.  And I figured since she rarely calls me in the middle of the night, it was probably important.“Hey, Claire.  Is everything okay?” I asked.“No!” she declared as she burst into tears.  “I need to talk…  I need help…”“I’m listening,” I reassured her.  “What’s on your mind?”“I lost my job this evening, and I’m tired, and I just don’t know anymore…”“A job is just a job.  They come and go.  Remember, Angel lost her job last year and it was a blessing in disguise.  She found something better.”“I know, I know,” she sighed over her tears.  “I just felt like the world was going to end after the accident…  Ya know?  And then my friends and family helped me get back on my feet…”“And you’re still on your feet right now,” I added.“Well, sometimes I feel like I am, and sometimes I feel like I’m barely maintaining my balance, and sometimes I feel like I’m falling again.  And this series of feelings just keeps cycling over and over again in a loop – good days followed by bad days and vice versa.  It’s just one long struggle.  And I’m exhausted!”“But you keep moving forward…”“Actually,” she continued over more tears.  “The only way I’ve found to keep myself moving forward from moment to moment through the hard times is by repeating a short saying my grandfather taught me when I was a kid.  And I don’t know how or why it helps now, but it does.”“What’s the saying?” I asked.“Do your best with what’s in front of you and leave the rest to the powers above you,” she replied.I smiled.  Because I love pieces of inspirational prose that help people progress through even the hardest of times.  And because it suddenly reminded me of a short story my grandfather told me when I was a kid – one that’s also applicable to Claire’s circumstance.“Your grandfather was a wise man,” I said.  “And it’s funny, because your grandfather’s saying reminds me of a short story my grandfather once told me.  Would you like to hear it?”“Yeah,” she replied.My Grandfather’s StoryOnce upon a time, in a small Indian village, the village fisherman accidentally dropped his favorite fishing pole into the river and was unable to retrieve it.  When his neighbors caught word of his loss, they came over and said, “That’s just bad luck!”  The fisherman replied, “Perhaps.”The following day, the fisherman hiked a mile down the bank of the river to see if he could find his fishing pole.  He came upon a small, calm alcove in the river bank that was loaded to the brim with salmon.  He used a back-up fishing pole to catch nearly 100 salmon, loaded them into his wagon, and brought them back to the village to barter with other villagers.  Everyone in the village was ecstatic to receive the fresh salmon.  When his neighbors caught word of his success, they came over and said, “Wow!  What great luck you have!”  The fisherman replied, “Perhaps.”Two days later, the fisherman began hiking back towards the alcove so he could catch more salmon.  But a tenth of a mile into the hike, he tripped on a tree stump and severely sprained his ankle.  He slowly and painfully hopped back to the village to nurse his health.  When his neighbors caught word of his injury, they came over and said, “That’s just bad luck!”  The fisherman replied, “Perhaps.”Four days went by, and although the fisherman’s ankle was slowly healing, he could not yet walk, and the village was completely out of fish to eat.  Three other villagers volunteered to go to the river to fish while the fisherman recovered.  That evening, when the three men did not return, the village sent a search party out for them only to discover that the men had been attacked and killed by a pack of wolves.  When the fisherman’s neighbors caught word of this, they came over and said, “You’re so lucky you weren’t out there fishing.  What great luck you have!”  The fisherman replied, “Perhaps.”“A few days later… well, you can guess how the story continues,” I said.The Moral of the StoryClaire chuckled and said, “Thank you.”  Because the moral of the story was immediately clear to her.  We just don’t know – we never do.  Life is an unpredictable phenomenon.  No matter how good or bad things seem right now, we can never be 100% certain what will happen next.And this actually lifts a huge weight off of our shoulders.  Because it means that regardless of what’s happening to us right now – good, bad or indifferent, it’s all just part of the phenomenon we call ‘life’ – which flows like the river in my grandfather’s story, unpredictably from one occurrence to the next.  And the smartest choice we can make is to swim with the flow of the river.Which means, quite simply, not panicking in the face of unforeseen misfortunes or losing our poise in limelight of our triumphs, but instead “doing our best with what’s in front of us and leaving the rest to the powers above us.”Photo by: A. Andres Just The Way You Are|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/the-way-you-are.jpg?resize=475%2C300&ssl=1|What is uttered from the heart alone,Will win the hearts of others to your own.– Johann Wolfgang von GoetheThis morning I was writing a blog entry at a local beach-side coffee shop here in San Diego when a young woman approached me.  “You’re Marc, right?” she asked.I looked up at her.  She had piercing eyes, a pierced nose, an elegant smile… but nothing that rang a bell.  “I’m sorry.  Do I know you?” I inquired politely.“No,” she replied.  “But I know you.”  She swiftly walked back to the table where she’d been sitting, picked up her laptop, and carried it over to me.  On the screen was Marc and Angel Hack Life.  “You look just like your photo,” she said in a chipper tone.I smiled.  “So you’re one of the seven people who read it.”She blushed.  “What I like about your writing is that it’s so real.”I cleared my throat.  “Real?” I asked.“I mean… you don’t hide anything.  You say it just like it is.  And that gives me hope!”“How do you know that I don’t hide anything?” I asked.She paused, tilted her head slightly and squinted her eyes as if, maybe, to look for something inside me that she had missed before.  “Well, your words seem so, so… honest.”Her compliment was appreciated, but it didn’t feel fair.  Perhaps because I’m not very good at accepting compliments, or perhaps because I’ve been thinking about honesty lately… and I’ve decided that I don’t like the word and its connotations.The Ruse“There are some things you should probably know,” I said.  “If I know a picture is being taken of me, I usually make a crooked half smile because I think it’s sexy.  If an attractive girl touches my arm, I flex a little bit because I think she prefers harder muscles.  And if I know people are coming over to my condo, I run around like a mad man and make it spotless before they arrive, because I’d like them to think that I’m clean and organized all of the time.”“But…”“And that’s just the beginning,” I continued.  “When I write a blog entry, I’m typically only writing about the people and experiences that inspire a single sentence that moves me.  For instance, in today’s post that sentence is: “Honesty is a matter of perception and intention.”  The rest is just my attempt to bring that sentence to life – to show why it’s meaningful to me.”“But can’t you see…”“And when I want to impress someone I’ve just met for the first time, I pretend that I’m overly outgoing and fearless.  And I try to say funny or profound things like, “Better to understand a little than to misunderstand a lot.”  But it usually doesn’t come out right because I don’t really want to be funny or fearless or profound.  Not right then.  I just want to break the ice and introduce myself.  And I want to do it without stumbling over my words…”“Marc, this is exactly the kind of honesty that inspires me!”“You’re missing the point.  These are revelations… and they’re revealing the ruse.  The sexy crooked smiles aren’t the smiles you see most often.  And the blog posts rarely include the sentences that inspire them.  And the folks I introduce myself to don’t see the real me, and they don’t realize that I’m nervous because I’m trying to impress them… because I want them to like me… and because…”You’re The Guy“Who are you trying to impress?” she asked.“That’s not the point,” I said.“But I want to know,” she insisted.“This is what I mean…” I continued.  “An honest person would just tell it to you straight.  But I write stories about a guy who wishes he was his cat, and nights of dancing naked, and Jamaican women in ice cream parlors… and who the heck knows what will come next.”“But you’re the guy who wishes he was his cat, right?” she asked.I grinned. “Shhh… don’t tell anyone.”“But won’t the new people you want to impress and all of the important people in your life know how you feel… now?” she asked.“No,” I replied.  “I don’t think they read this blog.”RevelationWe shared a long silence during which her gaze locked directly into the depths of my eyes.  Finally, she said, “I think I understand better why you give me hope.”“Why?” I asked.“Because at some point the world forgot – or perhaps never knew – that honesty isn’t about whether we make sexy smiles for the camera, mask autobiographical blog posts about our desires to be a cat, or try not to show our apprehension before meeting someone new.  Rather, honesty – revelation – is a matter of perception and intention.  And somebody recognizes that.  And it gives me hope and makes me think.”I smiled.  “And one other thing,” she said.“What?” I asked.“I’m pretty sure that whoever you want to impress will appreciate you just the way you are.  I know I do.”Photo by: Toni Blay How To Make Difficult Tasks Easier|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/difficult-tasks.jpg?resize=475%2C316&ssl=1|This guest post was written by Karl Staib, author of Work Happy Now. “Why am I insisting on procrastinating right now?”  You all know what I’m talking about – that dreaded task that makes you ignore reality.  It’s just sitting on your ‘to do’ list, ready to be tackled, but for some reason you keep checking your email.  You just checked it five minutes ago, but maybe now there is an important email needing your attention.Does this sound like somebody you know?This is a common theme throughout many of our work days.  We keep avoiding a difficult task because we are afraid to face it.The questions of…What if I **** it up?What if I can’t do it by myself?What if I look stupid?These debilitating questions can kill the motivation of even the strongest person, especially if these questions are left to fester.  Once the wound is open, it’s hard to ignore it.  Worry creeps in and it won’t let go.Here are some of the concepts that I use to overcome my dread of a difficult task:Start nowWhen you let your molehill turn into a mountain, the fear only builds and builds until you face it.  That means you just have to jump in and get started.  Once you start, you will begin to identify your strengths and weaknesses.  Breaking down the task in parts will make it seem possible and actually enjoyable to do.Separate the hard parts from the easy partsEvery task has its hard and easy parts.  When you can separate the two, you can pick the type of work that fits your mood.  Let’s say you work best in the late morning.  You can then choose to pick the hardest tasks for this time period.  If your energy dips in the late afternoon, you can choose to do work that is easier and uses less brain power during this time.Enjoy the emotional challengeDifficult tasks are usually avoided because of the suffering that they may cause.  You worry about how you might become frustrated, angry or sad.  Acknowledging these feelings is a great first step in building your emotional strength.A friend of mine told me that before she had kids, her patience was minimal.  After having two kids, she has the patience of a saint.  I’m always impressed with her calm demeanor when she is telling her kids to stop screaming while she is talking on the phone.  She has this calm quality of a Zen master.You can use a difficult challenge to become more patient, more relaxed, or just quicker to release frustration when you engage your emotional development at work.Figure out how this task will help the future youWhen I was an assistant teacher, I dreaded the days when the head teacher was sick.  It meant that I had to be the disciplinarian, time keeper, leader and so many other roles.  It was easier to just follow the head teacher’s lead.  I kept thinking these thoughts until I realized that I could use the experience to my advantage, because I wanted to be a teacher some day (little did I know I would be a teacher of work happiness).I embraced the work as a way to become stronger instead of trying to avoid it.Chip away everydayYou may look back at the end of the busy day and realize you didn’t get half of what you wanted accomplished.  This usually happens because you did the light work instead of the heavy lifting.  The way to feel fulfilled at the end of the day is to tackle the difficult tasks early so you can ease up when your energy wanes.You’ll be impressed at the end of the week at how much you really were able to accomplish.Find someone that wants to help youA difficult task is dreaded because of all the work that lies before you.  You feel like you can’t do it all by yourself.  And you shouldn’t.  That’s why finding someone to help you is very important to your emotional health.  This person can be a creative sounding board as well as someone you can complain to when things don’t go quite right.Find someone who doesn’t have all the same strengths as you.  Try to match yourself with a person who can make up for your weaknesses and complement your strengths.Ask yourself, “Am I the right person for the job?”There are some jobs that just don’t fit with your strengths.  Heck, you can’t be good at everything.  When working for someone, you may not have the power to turn down a project.  That is why #6 is even more important.  Adding people to your team will allow you to work on tasks that are aligned with your strengths.If you are repeatedly given work that you don’t like, then you may need to make a change.  You have an obligation to yourself to do work that makes you feel successful.Share your insights with othersThe bonus to working on a difficult task is the knowledge that you will gain.  It’s a great feeling to have this knowledge, but you need to take it to the next level.  Try sharing it with others via blog, newsletter, over the phone or in person.  You’ll love the reaction from your audience.And that’s the best part of teaching.  Teachers learn as much as their students.Karl Staib writes about the importance of happiness in the workplace and how to achieve it on his blog, Work Happy Now.Photo by: Paulgi How Small Talk Can Save Your Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/small-talk.jpg?resize=475%2C317&ssl=1|This guest post was written by Linda Kaplan Thaler and Robin Koval, authors of THE POWER OF SMALL.In today’s deadline driven, digital world, taking the time to ‘shoot the breeze’ with a coworker, neighbor, or passing stranger can seem like a waste of time.  But, in reality, nothing could be further from the truth.  Whether you’re a Washington politician or a barista at a local coffee shop, every one of us has the unique ability to inspire change in our lives and in the lives of others around us.  And small talk is the key.When we were writing our book, THE POWER OF SMALL: Why Little Things Make All the Difference, we discovered a truly amazing story that brought our attention to the unexpected ways in which ‘small talk’ can change and save lives.  In this case, it all started with a cup of coffee and a simple conversation.The Story of Annamarie and SandieEvery morning, when Annamarie Ausnes would head to her local Starbucks to pick-up her usual coffee, she looked forward to making a bit of small talk with the barista, Sandie Anderson, but she never imagined that those little conversations would one day save her life.Over time, what had begun as a casual, “How’s your morning?” or “Nice weather, huh?” eventually grew into more personal exchanges about their grandkids, weekend plans, and holiday traditions, until one day Sandie noticed something wasn’t quite right with her “short-drip double-cupped” customer. And instead of ignoring it, she decided to trust her instincts and asked one simple question: “Are you okay?”At first, Annamarie was reluctant to confide in her barista buddy, but with a little prodding, she opened up.“Actually, I’m not doing so well,” she sighed.  “I was just placed on the national kidney transplant list and I’m getting ready to go on dialysis.”To her shock, Sandie would discover that her friendly customer faced a bleak future.  Distraught and determined to help, Sandie announced that she would get tested to see if she could become a donor.As luck would have it, Sandie turned out to be a match and donated a kidney to Annamarie. Today Annamarie is not only alive and well, the two women are dear friends.  And it all started with a cup of coffee and a little small talk.Of course, not all of us have the ability or courage to make the huge gesture Sandie made by donating her kidney to a virtual stranger, but by simply making small talk, we open ourselves up to new people, new experiences, and new opportunities.  As children, we make friends easily.  We ask for each other’s names, we join in and play with one another.  But as we grow older, we tend to close ourselves off, shield ourselves with technology, and forget to acknowledge the people who are right in front of us.So put away the iPhone for a minute, look up from your laptop, and take the first step by saying hello to the stranger sitting next to you.  You never know, they just might be the hero you’ve been hoping for.In Their Own WordsHere’s a short video clip of Annamarie and Sandie sharing their story in their own words:Linda Kaplan Thaler and Robin Koval are co-authors of the national bestseller THE POWER OF SMALL: Why Little Things Make All the Difference, which debuted on the best seller lists of the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and The Washington Post.Photo by: polandeze "

for Building Stronger Relationships|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/3-communication-tips.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1|This guest post was written by Karl Staib, author of Work Happy Now!Last week I was talking on the phone with my brother, and even though we live 2,000 miles away from each other, he could still feel my sour attitude.  He asked me if everything was okay.  I was a bit surprised because I thought I was covering up my mood quite well.I brushed off his question and told him I was fine.  He wasn’t buying it and the rest of our phone conversation struggled along.People can feel the real message you are sending, whether you are talking to them on the phone, in person, or online.Don’t Just Reach Out to the FoolsI’m convinced most people can smell fear and bull crap.  If you try to cover it up, they may be fooled at first, but eventually they catch on.My subconscious usually picks up on whether or not people are sincere.  If someone is being insincere, I can feel this and I begin looking for validation.  Even if it’s just a split second feeling, I will be on the hunt to make sure I’m right.  My attention is distracted and I have trouble taking the person seriously.  That’s why as communicators (writing, speaking or body language), we have to believe that our audience is smart, savvy and ready to find faults in our message.  This also goes for an audience of just one.  It’s a problem that’s easily solved as long as you remain true to yourself.If you believe in your message then other people will trust you.  This isn’t always easy, so I’ve devised three questions that I ask myself before I talk or write anything to anyone.Rules for Communication:Am I telling a story?  (People connect to a story, not just facts.)Do I really believe this to be true?  (When communicating, we need to believe in everything we say.)Is this valuable?  (Will the other person find humor or knowledge in the message?)When I first started on Twitter, I was prone to just retweeting (sending out someone else’s tweet) anything that seemed cool.  There were times when I did not even take the time to check out the source.  So wrong on many levels. One time I retweeted a link then clicked on it and it took me to a jacked-up site that gave no value at all.  It actually had animated flying pigs on it.  And they weren’t even artistic.  Just a bunch of ugly pink pigs.The bottom line is you have to concentrate on sending out the right message to other people, otherwise you won’t be creating a likable personal brand that separates you from the wannabes.  In this day and age of social media we all need to manage our personal brands.  Future employers will be Googling your name to see if you’re communicating certain messages online that don’t mesh well with their corporate culture.You may not be trying to be an Internet superstar, but surely you’re trying to be the best communicator you can be.  Because if you can’t get your ideas across clearly and with conviction, no one will ever listen to you.Putting It All TogetherWe live in the greatest era for communication – a time when we can create our own brand and package it in a way that makes us happy.  Twenty years ago we were stuck with the channels of communication that big business gave us.  Of course we could put out a printed newsletter or ‘zine, but it was costly and its reach was limited.  Blogging, Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites make it so much easier to spread our message and our brand.You now have the ability to create your own happiness through communication of your expertise.I write about work happiness and right now there are more people working happy than ever before because they are able to express their true selves while they work.  People like Brian Clark, Sonia Simone, and Leo Babauta (Check out Leo’s story – it’s fascinating) have communicated from their heart and now they have a dedicated following.  They did this by believing so strongly in their message that nothing could hold them back from success.The key is knowing who you are and figuring out how to maximize your thoughts through communication.How do you optimize your ability to communicate well?It’s not easy, but worth your time to practice it.Always remember the three words – Story, Heart, and Value.StoryMake sure you tell a story that helps people connect to a specific concept.  Even the people who gossip about others know this because usually you are already intrigued by the person they are talking about.  That’s why it’s hard not to listen.  By sharing something about a person whom you already know, you can become more connected.Gossiping is wrong if it’s done to tear someone down, but gossip can also be positive. (i.e. a mother sharing a story about her daughter’s relationship with a friend or a manager sharing a story with her employee about another co-worker’s accomplishment in order to motivate her.) This type of communication can help us get through a tough time or find a solution to a problem.HeartBefore you say something, always check in with yourself for a half second to see if it’s really what you believe.  Do this again and again and again.  The time you take to develop this awareness, the more comfortable you will be with communicating to individuals and crowds.You probably think you do this, but do you really listen?  The difference between a writer who makes it and a writer who is always trying rests in their passion for the truth.  You can’t believe what you want to believe because it’s easier.  You have to communicate straight from your heart… and that takes guts.ValueDoes this information help the person in some way?  When telling a story, try to think of it as an opportunity to teach.  I’m not talking about ‘after school special’ lameness.  I’m talking about opening a person’s eyes to new perspectives or motivating them to try something new.When you communicate with the people in your life, you are setting the tone for future interaction.  If you create positive feelings then they will want more stories from you and more time with you.  If all you do is regurgitate other peoples thoughts and ideas, but don’t check in with your soul first, eventually the people around you will notice and stop caring.ConclusionYou have to choose communication that will build stronger, healthier relationships.How are you improving your ability to connect to your true self so you can communicate your message effectively?  Are you communicating from the deep depths of your heart?  If so, let us know in the comment section.Karl Staib writes about unlocking and kicking open the door to working happy on his blog: Work Happy Now!  If you enjoyed this article, you may like to subscribe to his feed, follow him on Twitter or read one of his most popular articles, Creating A Project Ritual to Encourage Happiness.Photo by: Scott Beale How To Make The World A Better Place|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/make-the-world-a-better-place.jpg?resize=500%2C348&ssl=1|This short story has moved to HERE:10 Hard Things to Remember When You Feel Like Giving Up 25 Beautifully Illustrated Thought-Provoking Questions|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/25-thought-questions.jpg?resize=475%2C345&ssl=1| 9 Timeless Nutrition Tips for Any Age|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/nutrition-tips-any-age.jpg?resize=475%2C305&ssl=1|This guest post was written by Nicole, author of My Years Without Sugar. Your health is your life.  Make it a priority.There are a zillion nutrition tips floating around out there.  Here are a few simple ones that have worked well for me over the years.Limit junk food or don’t eat it at all. – Whatever junk food you have in your kitchen, throw it out and replace it with healthy foods and snacks.  Look into other ways to comfort yourself and think of food as nutrition, not entertainment or emotional fodder.Go on a healthy food shopping spree. – Don’t look at prices.  Buy items that are healthy and appealing.  Fill your cupboards, pantry and fridge with healthy foods so you will not feel like your kitchen is empty.Limit eating out. – Most restaurant food has high amounts of sodium, sugar and fat.  There are few exceptions.  Spend more time with family or friends cooking together, or enjoy cooking for yourself.Visit a farmer’s market. – Because farmers markets make buying healthy food fun and interesting.  Most of the produce will be freshly picked, and taste heavenly compared to the refrigerated and thawed produce we get at grocery stores.  Many farmer’s markets have healthy homemade jams, local honey, hot sauce, or pickled this and that.Cut out the white stuff. – Sugar has zero nutrition.  Cut out high fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners, too.  Sugar is linked to the growing obesity epidemic in the US and the rising rates of diabetes.  It is also linked to heart disease, which remains the number one killer of people in the US.  Use natural sweeteners in baking like raw honey, date sugar or molasses, which retains high amounts of nutrients.Exercise.  – No level of nutrition can make up the difference for lack of exercise.  Walking counts, as does taking the stairs instead of the elevator.  Dr. Walter Willett of Harvard’s School of Public Health places exercise at the foundational base of his food pyramid.Eat at a table. – According to Michael Pollan’s latest book, Food Rules: An Eater’s Manual, “No, a desk is not a table.  If we eat while we’re working, or while watching TV or driving, we eat mindlessly, and as a result eat a lot more than we would if we were eating at a table, paying attention to what we’re doing.  When eating somewhere other than a table, stick to fruits and vegetables.”Eat smaller portions by buying smaller plates. – I gave my giant-sized dinner plates to the Salvation Army and bought smaller square plates.  And I eat less because of it.  According to Brian Wansink, author of Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think, in a study focused on size illusions, “People with a large bowl and a three-ounce scoop dished out 57 percent more ice cream than those given a smaller bowl and smaller scoop.”Cut out ‘beverages’ and drink water. – Water is free, whereas most beverages come with a price – a health price and a financial price.  One popular 12-ounce soda boasts a whopping 150 calories, and it offers no nutrition.  As a treat, drink tea instead of soda.Remember, it only takes 21 days of doing something to make it a habit.  So pick one of the tips above and start making it a healthy habit today.Follow Nicole on her blog, My Years Without Sugar, where she shares tips on escaping the sugar addiction.

Start|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/the-perfect-start.jpg?resize=475%2C316&ssl=1|Her First Subscriber“How did you do it?” she asked.  “In a sea of blogs that never make it, how did you start a personal blog that attracted the attention of 10,000 subscribers?”I chuckled.  “You know, I’ve been trying to wrap my mind around that one myself.”“Come on, Marc,” she insisted.  “I’m being serious here.  I’m getting ready to start my own blog and I’m nervous about failing.  I want to cross all my T’s and dot all my I’s – I don’t want to start it until I know how to do it right.”I stared at her for a moment.  “Well, one Sunday evening a few years ago, I made a decision to write an article about something that inspired me, and then I published it on my blog.  And every Sunday evening since, I’ve made a similar decision.”“That’s it?” she asked.  “No launch plan?  No design tweaks?  No marketing?”“No, at least not initially,” I replied.  “I did a little tweaking later on down the road, but by then my blog already had a catalog of articles up online.  And most of the tweaks were based on reader feedback and analyzing visitor stats to see which articles were attracting the most attention.”“So you think I simply need to start writing, right now… about the things that inspire me?”“Yeah,” I replied.  “The only way you can fail is by not writing – by waiting around until you have the perfect plan before you start.  Because ‘perfect’ doesn’t exist.  It isn’t human.  It isn’t you.She smiled and said, “Thank you.”Later that afternoon, she emailed me a link to her first published blog article.  And I became her first subscriber.What’s the core purpose?The hardest part, I have found, of creating something new – a website, a product, a technology – is simply the act of starting.  We let our creative minds get so caught up in planning and designing idealistic requirements and prerequisites for our new creation, that we drastically hinder the actual process of creating it.What stops most people from starting with a less than perfect plan or product is the fear of failure.  There’s a common misconception that if you don’t get it done exactly right the first time, your creation will fail and all efforts will be lost.  That without this feature or that tweak, there’s no point at all.  Nonsense.The truth is that every successful creation or innovation has a foundational core purpose – a tiny essence that justifies its existence.  Any tweak or feature above and beyond the scope of this core purpose is optional.  When my friend decided she wanted to start a blog, she spent all of her energy trying to map out the perfect plan and design, instead of simply writing her first few blog articles – which is the core purpose of a blog.So the next time you decide to create something new, back yourself into a corner, cut out the fluff, and release your core creation into the wild ASAP for others to experience and tinker with.  Less than perfect is a perfect start.  The need for intelligent tweaks and adjustments will arise naturally as time rolls on.Photo by: Vu Bui 5 Creative Ways to Upsize Your Life by Downsizing|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/upsize-by-downsizing.jpg?resize=475%2C329&ssl=1|This guest post was written by Betsy, co-author of Married With Luggage.Imagine relocating across the country and waiting for the moving truck to arrive so you can unpack your life and get settled.  Only the truck never makes it to your destination because it caught fire in New Jersey.  Everything you own is now ash, and through the magic of the Internet you find out that someone actually video recorded the fiery truck on the highway and uploaded it to YouTube.Burn, baby, burn.This actually happened to a friend of mine.  And he said that after an initial 10-minute freak out session, he started embracing the idea of starting over with a more simple existence.  “Not a bad idea,” I thought.The Cost of OwnershipNo matter what you own, there is a maintenance cost.  We can speak in dollars – insurance, taxes, interest.  Or even in time – cleaning, updating, protecting.  But the hardest maintenance cost for most people is simply sentimental value.We transfer our feelings and memories onto an object and decide we can’t let go because we’ll risk losing the feeling or memory.  Before long, we become surrounded by these visual reminders of our memories and no longer have room to make new ones.  It’s hard to move forward in your life when your past is crowding your present.Creative DownsizingThe answer, of course, is to get rid of some of this stuff.  But that’s way easier said than done.  We often need to be compelled to do this with a move or a lifestyle change.  Imagine how much richer life would be if we moved the junk out and made room for new opportunities instead of grudgingly making room only when it was forced upon us.My husband and I are currently simplifying our ‘physical’ lives down to a couple of boxes and two backpacks.  That’s a big change from our starting point in a packed 3500 square-foot house.We’re leaving on October 1 for Ecuador and 3+ years of exploring the world.  We’ve been working for a while to get to this point, as you can imagine, and along the way we’ve found a few creative downsizing strategies to help you simplify a little (or a lot) of your life.1. The Reverse Birthday PartyFor my 39th birthday I picked 39 of my favorite things – things that were special but not quite special enough to make it into my one box.  There was the silk scarf from France, the leather purse I bought on my honeymoon, a cocktail ring with more bling than my lifestyle required, and several other little treasures.I wrote out a tag for each item detailing its history and why it was special to me.  Then I put them all on a shelf in my living room and invited all my friends over for my birthday party.  The rules were simple:If you find something you like, write your name on the back of the tag.If you are the only one who wants that item, it is yours.If more than one person wants the item, a “face-off” would occur and a democratic vote would decide who won.In lieu of gifts to me, winners of the items could donate to our trip in an anonymous box on the bar.This kind of party accomplishes a few things.  You get to share and make wonderful memories with your good friends and continue to see your favorite items used by your favorite people in the future – much better than an anonymous eBay sale.  And your friends help you get through the pain of giving up the more sentimental things.  Take a picture of you with your friend and the item and you’ll still feel like you own it in a way.2. The Craigslist StoreI can’t say enough about the wonder that is Craigslist.  Just about anything can be sold or given away on this site.  We’ve sold everything from a $500 dresser to a $5 box of random cords, and we’ve rarely had an ad out more than a week without a bite.The key to successful Craigslist selling is to set up your own store. Do you have several pieces of furniture to sell?  Put them all together in a staging area.  When your buyers come by, they get a chance to see your other items and you can wheel and deal to get rid of more things.  People love a deal, so throwing in a rug you don’t think will sell for much with a piece of furniture a buyer is waffling on may help make the sale.Think of your downsizing project like your own little retail store and you’ll sell twice as much in half the time.3. Put it in a Box with an Expiration DatePeople tell me all the time they can’t get rid of things for all sorts of reasons.  But you know, reasons don’t really matter for this trick. It is all about “Out of sight, out of mind.”  Take a few things you don’t use, but think you can’t live without (even though you haven’t used them in 2 years), and put them in a box.  Label the box with the current date and the contents and a sell/donate date.  Set the sell/donate date 1 month out, 6 months out, or whatever.  I will be blown away if you end up going back for even 10% of these items before the sell/donate date.4. Take a Photo and Clear Your SpaceThis is one of my favorite ideas, especially for old clothes.  Do you have a photo of yourself on the night when you looked really hot in that outfit (you know, on that unforgettable night out with your friends)?  Keep the photo and get rid of the actual outfit if you no longer wear it on a regular basis.  If an occasion arises someday that requires a similar fancy outfit, treat yourself to something new and stylish.  Sometimes a photo that acts as a visual reminder is all you need to re-experience the joy of an item, and having it out of your space lets you live in the present instead of being cluttered by items you no longer use.5. The Rule of One Thing In, Two Things OutThis is the lazy man’s solution to downsizing, and it can be effective over the long-run.  You simply decide that for every new item you bring into your house or office, two items will go.  New socks?  Get rid of twice as many old socks.  Mom sends you new towels?  Get rid of twice as many of the old, raggedy ones.  See how this works?  It’s a smaller effort, but an everyday one.  Once you get to your perfect balance, you simply keep this up with one thing in, one thing out.Final Thoughts on the Benefits of DownsizingI like to say that downsizing will upsize your life.  I know it sounds catchy, but it’s true.  Since my husband and I started downsizing over 4 years ago we have more money, time, and opportunity than I could have ever imagined.  There is no way we’d be planning a trip around the world if we were still weighed down with all the miscellaneous stuff we had acquired over the years.So start small, like we did, and slowly integrate the 5 methods above into your current (cluttered) lifestyle.  I promise, you’ll find yourself in a clutter-free state in no time.Betsy Talbot is one half of the blogging team at Married with Luggage.

Money to Change Our Lives (and How You Can, Too!).Photo by: Dustin Diaz The Most Important Question You Can Ask Yourself|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/question-turns-dreams-into-reality.jpg?resize=475%2C361&ssl=1|InspiredOnce upon a time, two thirteen-year-old boys were watching the track and field Summer Olympics events on television.  Neither of them had previously spent any time watching amateur athletes strive with their heart and soul to be their absolute best, so the boys were mesmerized by the passion, determination, and athletic grace displayed by the Olympic competitors.  In a moment of unadulterated inspiration, the two of them made a pact to become Olympic track and field competitors before their twenty-first birthdays.That afternoon, over a glass of chocolate milk, they mapped out a rigorous training plan that involved frequent workouts both before and after school.  “If we stick to our training, we’ll be just as good the athletes on T.V.” one boy said to the other.  “I can’t wait to get started!” the other boy replied.The next morning at 6AM the two boys woke-up, put their running shoes on, and met outside to begin their first official training session.  As they began running down the block, both of them had radiant smiles on their mugs.  “This is awesome!” one boy exclaimed as they trotted toward the sunrise.Reality Raises One QuestionAbout nine minutes later, a mile down the road, the harsh truth inevitably revealed itself.  Both of them were out of shape, slow, and completely out of breath.  They had no previous athletic training and no clue how difficult it would be.  All they could think about now were the aches, pains and exhaustion their bodies were experiencing.Huffing and puffing, both boys stopped running and one fell to the ground on the side of the road.  “This is way harder than I thought,” the fallen boy said between breaths.“Tell me about it,” the other boy agreed as he, too, fell to the ground gasping for air.  “Do you think it’s worth it?”The other boy did not answer.  Instead, both of them rested on the cool morning grass in complete silence for several minutes, slowly regaining their breath, and thinking about the question.Suddenly the first fallen boy forced himself to his feet.  “Yeah, I do think it’s worth it!  Do you?”The other boy stood up slowly and nodded.  “Yeah, dude.  I think so too.”And without further hesitation, both of them began running again.The JourneyThe following month, they joined their middle school track and field team.  With continued practice and guidance from their coach, both of them eventually placed in the top ten percentile for various middle school track competitions during their seventh and eighth grade school years.In high school, they spent all four years on the track and field and cross country running teams.  Both of them consistently placed in the top five percentile for their grade and won various gold, silver, and bronze awards in the district competitions.  During their senior year, their track and field team made it to the state competition.  One boy walked away with a silver medal for the long jump and the other won a bronze medal for the 1500 meter run.They both earned and accepted track and field scholarships to different state colleges.  Over the course of the next two years, even though they were apart, they trained passionately, competed head to head against one another on several occasions, and each won various collegiate events.  One time, they even placed first and second overall in the same exact event.And although neither of them earned an Olympic medal, during their junior year of college, at the age of 20, they were reunited as teammates when they represented their country in the Summer Olympics.ConclusionWhen I was young, I was fortunate enough to have parents and mentors who taught me that the people who achieve their dreams and make the greatest impact in the world – whether athletically, musically, politically, technologically or otherwise – are rarely the most talented or gifted individuals.  They are instead the ones who work the hardest, and who are willing to overcome all obstacles to see their dreams through to fruition.The moments when we feel uncertain about how to move forward, when we are inspired by our dreams but overwhelmed by the work required to achieve them, are the moments when we must ask ourselves one simple question:Do you think it’s worth it?Photo by: Millzero One Decision that Changes Everything|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/one-decision-changes-everything.jpg?resize=475%2C321&ssl=1| Mmmm.  YUM.  Sounds good doesn’t it? And yet very few people ever live to become the success story they dream about. Why? Because all successful people have one excruciatingly simple thing in common. And it’s the only thing that’s stopping you from being insanely, abundantly, super successful. Successful people take action. That’s it. “Take action?  Yeah, right!”  It sounds too simple, doesn’t it? Yeah, it does.  But don’t be fooled.  It is that simple.  So before you stop reading this and go back to your blurry life of mediocrity, listen up. Most people live in a complete daze.  Actually, they don’t LIVE.  They just ‘get by’ because they never take the necessary action to make things happen – to seek their dreams.  Does this sound like someone you know? But successful people… They’re ALIVE.  They make things happen because they take action. They have that look in their eyes – undiluted determination and infinite appetite for possibility. They live in constructive flow, always looking for a way – always taking the next logical step. When you constructively move forward with a positive outlook on life, all of the self-induced barriers dissolve and you get out of your own way.  Nothing feels impossible and you see potential and possibility in everything because you’re not limiting your focus with destructive negativity. Successful people constantly live in a state of productive positivity.  They don’t settle and they aren’t scared to fail.  They try, and fail, and try again until they succeed.  Because they know it’s possible, even if they haven’t yet figured out how. Everything they do is soaked in a deep personal desire to move things forward. They live for the feeling of accomplishment.  You know this feeling… It’s the feeling of complete immersion in what you’re doing – when you tickle your own brilliance and the distinction between ‘you’ and the task at hand blurs until it’s complete.  It’s those moments when you’re taking action and constructively flowing with life instead of aimlessly stumbling through it. I know you’ve felt it.  Maybe not often enough, but you have. In every situation there is always a ‘most constructive’ path to choose. Whether you’re running a business, having a conversation, walking down the street and see someone you’d like to meet, or even just entertaining yourself by browsing online – there’s always a constructive path. Ask yourself, “What can I do right now that will make me more successful in my own eyes?” The interesting thing is that as you ask yourself this question, little electrochemical fireworks explode in your mind and illuminate your entire being with the feeling of what success will be like.  Your mind automatically cycles through all the possible situations that will result from the different choices for an action that you take. So ask yourself the question and think about what will help you move forward with your goals.  Immerse yourself in thought.  What is it that you really want?  And what choice can you make right now that will help you get one step closer? After awhile your mind will become trained to subconsciously think about success, so when you have a little time and are deciding what to do, that image of success that came up will poke its head into your plans and make you think twice about zoning out in front of the T.V. Sure, sometimes it’ll be a small action like reading a book, but momentum builds and as you begin to feel the possibilities for success, you’ll stop limiting what you deem ‘possible’ and you start taking on bigger projects and more promising endeavors. And as you do it more and more, it becomes less of a question and more of an overall state of being where all you will want to do is move forward towards success.  And it feels really good.  It brings purpose into your life. And it doesn’t have to be just material success – deciding to read for pleasure, meditate, exercise, or spend time with a loved one are all valid decisions toward success.  The definition of success, after all, is up to you. But more than anything, success hinges on the simple act of making a decision to live – to absorb yourself in the process of going after your goals. So make that decision… And take action.

"7 Ways To Find Happiness Through Simplicity|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/happiness-through-simplicity.jpg?resize=475%2C306&ssl=1| Happiness can be elusive when life is too complicated. As daily commitments multiply, we find ourselves becoming conditioned to shifting between multiple tasks, creating lengthy to-do lists and juggling complicated schedules.  When we’re not overwhelmed, we may feel proud that we can keep up with it all.  It’s all part of making a living, but in the end it can stand in the way of making a life. Does your schedule leave you time for things that bring true happiness? These things vary for each of us, but for most people true happiness consists of spending time with loved ones and engaging in activities that reveal the richness and beauty of the world around us. To get the most out of these activities, you must approach them from a place of stillness, peace and calm. A busy life can be personally fulfilling, but it may leave you feeling too frazzled to achieve the stillness and peace that will allow you to connect with deep happiness and the underlying beauty of life.  You can’t just walk away from the responsibilities that fracture your time, but you can simplify your life so that your mind is calmer and more open to the hidden treasures in life. Here are 7 ways to get started with simplifying your life and working towards a more peaceful state of mind. Remember that simplicity is a process, not a destination. For most of us, there is no escaping the inherent complexity of our lives.  However, by deciding to simplify your life and spend more time seeking true happiness, you’ve started on a road that can lead to profound changes in your life. There is no final destination at the end of this road. Because life is forever changing and evolving, and you are evolving along with it, you will never reach a point of perfect simplicity and endless happiness.  But each moment you spend on the path to simplicity does have the potential to bring more serenity and happiness into your life. “If you want happiness for an hour – take a nap. If you want happiness for a day – go fishing. If you want happiness for a month – get married. If you want happiness for a year – inherit a fortune. If you want happiness for a lifetime – help someone else.” – Chinese Proverb Photo by: EJP Photo We Dance Together Even When We Are

belief, positive thinking may seem like a bunch of hogwash.  After all, who wants to waste time with self-induced brainwashing?If positive thinking was nothing more than a ploy to pull the wool over your own eyes, I wouldn’t bother.  But it is so much more.  So I want to share some facts about the value of deliberately guiding your thoughts and the best way to do so successfully.What positive thinking is all aboutPositive thinking means choosing thoughts that feel good rather than allowing outside elements to control the caliber of our thoughts.It’s about choosing to look at life experiences from a pleasant perspective and harnessing our power to seize the best in any circumstance.There are always flowers for those who want to see them.– Henri MatisseWhat positive thinking is notBrainwashing is defined as “a forcible indoctrination to induce someone to give up basic political, social, or religious beliefs and attitudes and to accept contrasting regimented ideas.”Unlike brainwashing, having a positive outlook should never make you feel like you’re forcing yourself to believe lies or to give up ideas that are important to you.  The purpose of positive thinking is not to distract you from the truth, but to refocus your attention on beautiful truths that you may often take for granted.How to effectively apply positive thinkingOur lives are filled with a variety of experiences, circumstances, people and things.   Some trigger pleasing thoughts and feelings within us while others set off a downward spiral of negativity.You may be wondering how positive thinking can be implemented when faced with something that is undeniably negative.  There are two basic options:  focus elsewhere or focus differently.1.  Focus elsewhere when you’re ableFocusing elsewhere means you take your attention from the troubling subject to something that feels better.  There are times when this is clearly the best choice.  Here’s an example:You’re with a group of people who are discussing political hot topics.  The discussion gets extremely heated as everyone defends their views on abortion, health care, prayer in schools, gay marriage, immigration and even President Obama’s Nobel Peace Prize win.The tension gets high and the words get ugly.  You feel yourself becoming extremely angry and frustrated with some of the outrageous comments, personal jabs, senseless views and put downs.In such a situation, you may simply decide not to be a part of the conversation.  Sure, others may take offense or respond negatively if you walk away.  So what!  What’s more important?  Doing what others think you should or doing what you know is best for you?Bottom line:  If you can’t change the subject of discussion, just leave the room and find something else to do.  Your attention to political differences is unlikely to change someone else’s mind.  So, why bother with something unnecessarily distressing when you can put your focus and energy elsewhere?2.  Focus differently when you can’t escape the situationAlthough it’s not always possible to avoid an unpleasant experience, we can decide to bring our conscious awareness to a different aspect of it.  In other words, we can focus differently.You don’t have to focus on the clouds just because it’s a rainy day.  You can focus on what the weather was like yesterday or on the day of your wedding or at some other time when you felt it was ideal.  You can even focus on the benefits of the rain and all the purposes it serves.  The flowers, grass and trees are surely pleased to have their thirst quenched.If you lose your hearing, you can waste your life away feeling sad about the sounds that you’re missing out on.  Or you can celebrate the heightened state of your other senses.  You can appreciate and follow in the footsteps of Ludwig Beethoven, Marlee Matlin, Thomas Edison, Helen Keller and other famous hearing impaired people who achieved great success because they didn’t let their disabilities foil their outlook on the possibilities that lay before them.  Neither positive nor negative thoughts will spontaneously restore your hearing, but one type of thought leads to healthy living, while the other encourages endless misery.A real world example of positive thinkingPositive thinking is most effective when you choose thoughts that your mind easily accepts as reasonable.  Hearing loss is a bit extreme, so how about a more practical example for using positive thinking in everyday life?Let’s say your car breaks down.  It is unlikely that any thought will change the fact that the car isn’t working.  So while you could try to imagine that it’s running perfectly, it isn’t a very productive practice unless you have magical genie powers.So as you put the key in the ignition and notice that the car won’t start, you can be angry, anxious and sad as you focus on how terrible it is that your car is broken.  You can gripe about the money it will cost, the time it will take, the inconvenience it will cause.  You can go on and on like this until you’ve taken on enough stress to raise your blood pressure to stroke level.  None of these thoughts will change the situation, but they will ensure that you feel horrible.On the other hand, you could choose to think of the sexy (or skilled or nice) mechanic who will get you back on the road.  You can think of how reliable the car has been up to this point, the games you can play on your cell phone as you wait for a tow truck, or the funny hat that the lady is wearing in the car next to you.  None of this changes the fact that the car is not working, but at least you’re choosing to think in a way that is likely to attract an unexpected opportunity rather than a massive coronary.ConclusionYou see, positive thinking is not about fooling yourself.  It’s about changing your outlook to a different side of reality.  As an avid believer in the Law of Attraction, I apply positive thinking to almost everything.  Notice I said almost, because I have my down-in-the-dumps moments like everyone else.So, what about you? When you’re faced with something upsetting, do you find comfort in guiding your thoughts to a more positive outlook?  If not, why not?Nea is the author of the Self Improvement Saga, a blog where she shares her passion for writing and personal development.  Her goal is to help others manifest improvements in both their daily lives and relationships.  If you enjoyed this post then consider subscribing to her RSS feed. Photo by: Tourist on Earth When Fairy Tale Characters Come To Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/fairy-tales.jpg?resize=475%2C315&ssl=1|This morning I was writing at my favorite coffee shop when a cute Latin woman with big, bright eyes and rosy cheeks sat down at the table across from me.  She pulled a sketch book out of her backpack and began looking around the room.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw her look in my direction, study my posture, smile, and begin sketching.We sat there next to each other for nearly three hours while she sketched and I wrote.  And as I shifted back and forth, engrossed in thought, I felt a bit self-conscious.  Because I could feel her watching me as she practiced her art.But I wasn’t too worried because I hadn’t planned on talking to her.  After all, she seemed completely satisfied sketching in silence, and smiling at her sketches and at all of the other people who surrounded us.  I did, however, glance up a few times just to see her smile.  Because her smile expressed a kind of passion I seldom see.All of the World’s BeautyA few moments later another customer came into the coffee shop and let a gust of wind in the front door.  The wind blew a completed sketch right off of the Latin woman’s table and onto the floor in front of me.  The sketch was rather amazing.  It perfectly depicted a man who looked a lot like me typing on a laptop computer.I looked up at the Latin woman and smiled.  “Who’s that sharp-looking guy?”She giggled and rolled her eyes.  “I don’t know,” she replied.  “He’s just a fairy tale character.”  She then handed me a few of the other sketches she’d been working on.  One of them was of the barista behind the cash register and the others were of other customers in the coffee shop.“Wow!” I exclaimed.She sighed, smiled, and said, “Sometimes I wish that I could capture all of the world’s beauty in my sketches, but I’ve come to realize that it’s simply impossible. So capturing still-frames of beautiful moments is what I settle for.”I told her that all of the world’s beauty actually is captured in every sketch that perceives a moment just as beautiful.  And that her sketches are truly beautiful, just like her smile… because they reveal a gift and a passion to see beauty in common places – a beauty most of us overlook.Time CeasesShe giggled again and said, “My mother once told me that beauty occurs when time ceases to exist.  And if she’s right, then perhaps my sketches are beautiful.  Because, for me, time ceases when I try to bridge my perceptions with the moments unfolding around me.”I chuckled aloud and then turned my laptop around so that she could read the words I had written just moments before: “Time ceases to exist when she engages in this moment, because she wants nothing more than the beauty this moment has to offer.”“Who is she?” she asked.“She’s just a fairy tale character others will read about… and metaphor for hope to me,” I replied with a wink.She winked back, as if to prove that she wasn’t just a metaphor.  And before I could even smile, I suddenly sneezed.  She laughed and told me that for just a moment in mid-sneeze I looked like Tarzan, and asked if I could hold that pose so she could sketch me looking like Tarzan.I told her that I didn’t mind holding a mid-sneeze pose for a few minutes.  Because as she sketched, I got a chance to see the look in her eyes.  You know the look I’m talking about… it’s the look when beauty is perceived, time ceases to exist, and fairy tale characters come to life. How To Inspire Kids To Save The World|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/kids-save-the-world.jpg?resize=475%2C333&ssl=1|My buddy Chad, a 9th grade science teacher, called me at 7AM this morning in a bit of a panic.  “Marc,” he said. “I promised my students I’d have a guest speaker here today, but the speaker just canceled on me at the last minute.  I know you love motivating others, so is there any way you could come in this morning and be our substitute speaker?”“What’s the topic?” I asked.“How to save the world,” he replied with a chuckle.  “I’m kidding.  The speaker I had scheduled was from the city waste management counsel.  She was supposed to speak to the kids about the importance of recycling and conserving the environment and so forth.”“I don’t know,” I replied.  “I don’t really have any…”“Come on, Marc,” he insisted.  “Please.  Pretty please!  I know it would mean so much to the kids if you came in today.  And I’ve been meaning to ask you to be a guest speaker for awhile now.”I thought about it for a second.  “Well… okay.  What time do you need me to come in?”“Yes!  Thank you!  If you could be here at 9AM that would be awesome!”“Uh, yeah… I’ll see you then,” I replied with a bit of uncertainty in my voice.Crashing and BurningI arrived promptly at 9AM.  After a short introduction by Chad, I walked up to the front of the classroom.  I didn’t have any cool props or cue cards.  In fact, I barely had enough time to think about what I was going to say.  But as 42 sets of inquiring eyes stared at me, I knew I only had one shot, just one shot to convince them that they could make a difference in this crazy world.  So I took a deep breath and said:“What if I told you that you and your immediate family were personally contributing to catastrophic environmental issues around the world?  And what if I told you that it gets even worse?  What if I also told you that you were directly contributing to human starvation, water and energy shortages, widespread health problems, and so much more?”The kids remained quiet but seemed irritated.  “It’s true,” I continued.  “You might not realize you’re doing these things, but you are…”  And with every word that left my lips, the kids seemed less and less interested in what I had to say.I wasn’t lying to them.  Because I know for a fact that only a small fraction of American families live sustainable lifestyles.  But I wasn’t winning any friends or influencing a single kid with my approach.  I was actually doing the exact opposite – I was crashing and burning in a big way.A Second ChanceAnd just when I started to seriously choke over my words, the fire alarm went off.  It was just a fire drill, but I was so relived because it gave me a chance to regroup and effectively organize my thoughts.  And as we walked back into the classroom, I knew I had less than thirty seconds to recapture the attention of my audience.  So I took another deep breath and said:“How many of you have ever donated canned goods to the needy?  Wow, almost all of you!  That’s great!  Now, how many of you recycle on a regular basis?”  Everyone in the class raised a hand.  I smiled.  “Oh, this is inspiring!  And how many of you have ever held the door open for someone else behind you?”  Again, almost every kid raised a hand.“Well, I’m really impressed,” I stated in a sincere tone.  “I’m so sorry.  Please accept my apology.  I was totally wrong about you all.  It appears that we have a whole classroom filled with go-getters who are already practiced in bettering our world.  You should be proud of yourselves.”Smiles broke out across the classroom.“Now let’s take a moment and think about something together,” I continued.  What if – without making much more of an effort than we’re making right now – we could join collectively as one and feed every starving person in the world, restore the environment, inspire positive change in the lives of others, and have fun in the process?  Would you do it?  Would you want to learn how?”“Yeah!”  the kids replied collectively.Well that too is inspiring!” I shouted.  “Because if we could convince enough people to think the way you do, together we could do all of these things and so much more… together we could save the world.”Again, big smiles broke out across the classroom.ConclusionThere are two methods for inspiring positive change in our youth.  The first is to ask them to look in the mirror and see the absolute worst of themselves, and hope that they have enough self-confidence to make a change.  The second is to ask them to look in the mirror and see the absolute best of themselves, which gives them the self-confidence needed to make a change.Photo by: notsogoodphotography "
"8 Stupid Mistakes Smart People Make|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/8-stupid-mistakes.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1|I bet you know quite a few capable people who are staggeringly unproductive.  They work long hours, stress themselves out and never seem to make any significant progress, right?Over the course of our lives we all develop unproductive habits that hinder us from gracefully achieving our critical goals.  And often, in the fast-paced world in which we live and work we don’t even notice that we’re making the same mistakes over and over again.  To live a balanced, beneficial life and engage in a long-term satisfying work, ridding ourselves of these oversights is imperative.Here are eight mistakes smart people often make and how to avoid them:1.  They confuse being busy with being productive.In his book, The 4-Hour Workweek, Tim Ferris says, “Slow down and remember this: Most things make no difference.  Being busy is often a form of mental laziness – lazy thinking and indiscriminate action.”  This is Ferris’ way of saying “work smarter, not harder,” which happens to be one of the most prevalent modern day personal development clichés.  But like most clichés, few people actually adhere to it.Just take a quick look around.  The busy outnumber the productive by a wide margin.Busy people are rushing all over the place, and running late half of the time.  They’re heading to work, conferences, meetings, social engagements, etc.  They barely have enough free time for family get-togethers and they rarely get enough sleep.  Yet, business emails are shooting out of their smart phones like machine gun bullets and their daily planner is jammed to the brim with obligations.Their busy schedule gives them an elevated sense of importance.  But it’s all an illusion.  They’re like hamsters running on a wheel.The solution:  Slow down.  Breathe.  Review your commitments.  Put first things first.  Do one thing at a time.  Start now.  Take a short break in two hours.  Repeat.2.  They spend time pursuing bogus achievements.Personal growth is healthy.  Personal growth is an achievement.  So long as it’s real.  The problem is the pressure to grow brings with it the incentive to make growth easier.  Or more precisely, to make growth seem easier.‘Growth games’ that promote bogus achievements are popping up online at an alarming rate.  Many of them are contained within products and services provided by popular brand names like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.  They each contain a psychological underpinning that supports a growth game filled with bogus achievements – an accumulation of points that’s tied to the intended benefit of the core product or service.With Facebook it’s friends.  With Twitter it’s followers.  With LinkedIn it’s connections.Yes, each of them serves a legitimate purpose if used purposefully in moderation.  But most people get so carried away – obsessed – with the growth game’s point system that they completely forget about the legitimate reason they started using the product or service in the first place.If you’re playing the game simply for entertainment’s sake, and you’re aware of it, great, more power to you.  But if you’re striving to achieve more and more friends, followers and connections for the sake of achieving them, your achievements are totally bogus.This is why it’s imperative to get your mind right about what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.The solution:   Simply ask yourself:  Is this activity making a positive, tangible difference in my life or anyone else’s life?  Is it a true prerequisite for a genuine goal?  Alternatively, am I absolutely okay with doing this just because I like doing it, laboring free of any delusion that it benefits me or anyone else?  The Success Principles is a great read on this topic.3.  They learn how to do something and never do it.Sadly, very few people ever live to become the success story they dream about.  And there’s one simple reason why:They never take action!The acquisition of knowledge doesn’t mean you’re growing.  Growing happens when what you know changes how you live.   Most people live in a complete daze.  Actually, they don’t LIVE.  They just ‘get by’ because they never take the necessary action to make things happen – to seek their dreams.It doesn’t matter if you have a genius IQ and a PhD in Quantum Physics, you can’t change anything or make any sort of real-world progress without taking action.  There’s a huge difference between knowing how to do something and actually doing it.  Knowledge and intelligence are both useless without action.  It’s as simple as that.The solution:  Success hinges on the simple act of making a decision to live – to absorb yourself in the process of going after your goals.  So make that decision.  And take action.  For some practical guidance on taking action I highly recommend The Now Habit.4.  They use the wrong measurements to track their progress.You can’t control what you don’t properly measure, and what you measure predicts your future.  If you track the wrong things you’ll be completely blind to potential opportunities as they appear over the horizon.Imagine if, while running a small business, you made it a point to keep track of how many pencils and paperclips you used.  Would that make any sense?  No!  Because pencils and paperclips are not a measure of what’s important for a business.  Pencils and paperclips have no bearing on income, customer satisfaction, market growth, etc.Let’s use blogging as a real world example.  Many wannabe probloggers (folks who aspire to blog for a living) actually view their blog’s RSS subscriber count as their number one measurement of success.  They track it meticulously and then freak out when Feedburner (a popular  RSS tracking service) experiences one of its frequent hiccups.  But what they fail to realize is that their RSS subscriber count is not a crucial measurement for their goal of becoming a problogger because most RSS subscribers have a very low level of engagement with the host site and its various revenue generators.  And generating revenue is a must for a problogger.Once again, what you measure predicts your future.  You should be measuring the things that are directly tied to your primary goal.The solution:  The proper approach is to figure out what your number one goal is and then track the things that directly relate to achieving that goal.  In my example above on problogging, that goal should be “making money from a blog.”  And a few things worth tracking would be click through ratios on ads, affiliate conversion rates, in-house product conversion rates, customer/reader feedback, etc.I recommend that you take some time to identify your number one goal, identify the most important things for you to keep track of and then begin tracking immediately.  On a weekly basis, plug the numbers into a spreadsheet and use the data to create weekly or monthly trend graphs so you can visualize your progress.  Then fine-tune your actions to get those trends to grow in your favor.5.  They become obsessed with making things perfect.Many of us are perfectionists in our own right.  I know I am at times.  We set high bars for ourselves and put our best foot forward.  We dedicate copious amounts of time and attention to our work/passion to maintain our high personal standards.  Our passion for excellence drives us to run the extra mile, never stopping, never relenting.  And this dedication towards perfection undoubtedly helps us to achieve results.  So long as we don’t get carried away.But what happens when we do get carried away with perfectionism?We become disgruntled and discouraged when we fail to meet the (impossibly high) standards we set for ourselves, making us reluctant to take on new challenges or even finish tasks we’ve already started.  Our insistence on dotting every ‘I’ and crossing every ‘T’ breeds inefficiency, causing major delays, stress overload and subpar results.True perfectionists have a hard time starting things and an even harder time finishing them… always.  I have a friend who has wanted to start a graphic design business for several years.  But she hasn’t yet.  Why?  When you sift through her extensive list of excuses it comes down to one simple problem.  She is a perfectionist.  Which means she doesn’t, and never will, think she’s good enough at graphic design to own and operate her own graphic design business.The solution:  The real world doesn’t reward perfectionists.  It rewards people who get things done.  And the only way to get things done is to be imperfect 99% of the time.  Only by wading through years of practice and imperfection can we begin to achieve momentary glimpses of the perfection.  So make a decision.  Take action.  Learn from the outcome.  And repeat this method over and over and over again in all walks of life.  Also, check out Too Perfect.  It’s an excellent read on conquering perfectionism.6.  They wait until they feel 100% ready before acting on an opportunity.This point is somewhat related to the point above on perfectionism, but encompasses enough on its own to be discussed separately.The number one thing I persistently see holding smart people back is their own reluctance to accept an opportunity simply because they don’t think they’re ready.  In other words, they believe they require additional knowledge, skill, experience, etc. before they can aptly partake in the opportunity.  Sadly, this is the kind of thinking that stifles personal growth.The truth is nobody ever feels 100% ready when an opportunity arises.  Because most great opportunities in life force us to grow emotionally and intellectually.  They force us to stretch ourselves and our comfort zones, which means we won’t feel totally comfortable at first.  And when we don’t feel comfortable, we don’t feel ready.The solution:  Remember that significant moments of opportunity for personal growth and development will come and go throughout your lifetime.  If you are looking to make positive changes in your life you will need to embrace these moments of opportunity even though you will never feel 100% ready for them.7.  They inundate themselves with too many choices.Here in the 21st century where information moves at the speed of light and opportunities for innovation seem endless, we have an abundant array of choices when it comes to designing our lives and careers.  But sadly, an abundance of choice often leads to indecision, confusion and inaction.Several business and marketing studies have shown that the more product choices a consumer is faced with, the less products they typically buy.  After all, narrowing down the best product from a pool of three choices is certainly a lot easier than narrowing down the best product from a pool of three hundred choices.  If the purchasing decision is tough to make, most people will just give up.Likewise, if you inundate yourself too many choices, your subconscious mind will give up.The solution:  If you’re selling a product line, keep it simple.  And if you’re trying to make a decision about something in your life, don’t waste all your time evaluating every last detail of every possible option.  Choose something that you think will work and give it a shot.  If it doesn’t work out, choose something else and keep pressing forward.8.  They lack balance in their life.If you ask people to summarize what they want out of life they cough up a lot of words like ‘Love,’ ‘Money,’ ‘Success’, ‘Family’, ‘Recognition’, ‘Peace,’ ‘Happiness,’ etc.  But all of these things are totally different, and most people want all of them in their life.  Sadly, a vast majority of people don’t balance their life properly to achieve them.I know an extremely savvy businesswoman who made almost a million dollars online last year. Every entrepreneur I know considers her to be wildly successful.  But guess what?  A few days ago, out of the blue, she told me that she’s depressed.  Why?  “I’m burnt out and lonely.  I just haven’t taken enough time for myself lately,” she said.  “Wow!” I thought.  “One of the most successful people I know isn’t happy.”I also know a surfer who surfs almost all day, every day on the beach in front of our condo complex in San Diego.  He’s one of the most lighthearted, optimistic guys I’ve ever met – always smiling from ear to ear.  But he sleeps in a van he co-owns with another surfer and they both frequently panhandle tourists for money.  So while I can’t deny that this man seems happy, I wouldn’t classify his life as a success story.These are just two simple examples of imbalanced lifestyles.  I could think of dozens of other examples like these just out of the small pool of people I know personally.The solution:  When your work life (or social life, family life, etc.) is busy and all your energy is focused in that arena it’s all too easy to find yourself off balance.  While drive and focus is important, if you’re going to get things done right you still need to balance the various dimensions of your life.  Completely neglecting one dimension for another only leads to long-term frustration and stress.  For some practical guidance on balancing your life I recommend Zen And the Art of Happiness.Photo by: Florian Leroy 60 Inconvenient Personal Development Truths|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/60-self-development-truths.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1|I know you want to be the best you can be.  We all do.  But sometimes we look for success in the wrong places or we try to achieve it in the wrong ways.Here are 60 inconvenient truths about personal development to help you stay on track.The acquisition of knowledge doesn’t mean you’re growing.  Growing happens when what you know changes how you live.You can’t have good ideas unless you’re willing to generate a lot of bad ones.A good idea without action is nothing at all.It’s not so much about finding opportunities as it is about creating them.10% of our lives is decided by uncontrollable circumstances.  90% is decided by how we react to those circumstances.What we don’t start today won’t be finished by tomorrow.If you’re waiting for the perfect conditions, ideas or plans to get started, you’ll never achieve anything.If you keep doing what you’re doing, you’ll keep getting what you’re getting.Change is often resisted when it is needed the most.Discipline is choosing what you want most over what you want right now.  Read The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.The harder you work, the luckier you will become.Kindness and hard work together will always carry you farther than intelligence.Life is not easy, especially when you plan on achieving something worthwhile.Tough times don’t last, but tough people do.Lots of successful people have failed as many times as they have succeeded.Nobody succeeds all by themselves.Right now, there’s a lot you don’t know.Having a plan, even a flawed one at first, is better than no plan at all.In the beginning, you need to say “yes” to a lot of things to discover and establish your goals.  Later on, you need to say “no” to a lot of things and concentrate on your goals.No matter how you make a living or who you think you work for, you only work for one person, yourself.  The big question is:  What are you selling, and to whom?We all have different strengths.  What worked for someone else might not work for you.To be great does not mean you have to dominate others.  It means you have to dominate your own potential.Being successful is a journey, not a destination.Results are more important than the time it takes to achieve them.Being busy and being productive are two different things.Being happy and being successful are two different things.You don’t have to settle.  It’s simply a choice you make every day.Life is full of opportunities to feel exactly the way you want to feel.You have every right to be happy, but it’s up to YOU and only YOU to exercise that right.  Read The Happiness Project.You have the ability to clear negativity from your mind with a single thought.We are all multi-dimensional human beings with simultaneous dimensions of success and failure in our lives.Your success isn’t just about you.  It’s about how you positively impact the lives around you.Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain, and most fools do.Holding onto anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else – you are the one who gets burned.Life isn’t always logical.When you spend time worrying, you’re simply using your imagination to create things you don’t want.It’s usually only as good or bad as you think it is.There is a lesson in everything you do, and learning the lesson is how you move forward.No matter how smart you are, you will make mistakes.There’s no such thing as ‘risk free.’  Everything you do or don’t do has an inherent risk.Saying “no” to right people gives you the time and resources required to say “yes” to right opportunities.Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.When you’re caught up in the moment and your emotions are soaring, you’re bound to make poor decisions.Simplicity is often a major factor of success.  But the process of simplifying things is rarely easy.Cutting your losses is often better than the alternative.It’s uncomfortable to challenge the status quo, but it’s worth it.You can raise the bar or you can wait for others to raise it.  Either way, it’s getting raised.Oftentimes, the only reason they want you to fit in is that once you do they can ignore you and go about their business.Confusion isn’t a bad thing.  It means you’re growing and thinking.When you see the world as it is, but insist on making it more like it could be, you matter.When kids grow up wanting to be you, you matter.Trying to be somebody you’re not is not sexy.  Be you.  That’s when you’re beautiful.Good looks attracts the eyes.  Personality attracts the heart.Sometimes you just have to do your own thing your own way, no matter what anyone else thinks or says about you.When you receive negative feedback, remember, it doesn’t matter how many people don’t get it, it matters how many do.  Read The 4-Hour Workweek.If you awake every morning with the thought that something wonderful will happen in your life today, and you pay close attention, you’ll often find that you’re right.Truly ‘rich’ people need ‘less’ to be happy.A good life is when you assume nothing, do more, need less, smile often and realize how fortunate you are right now.If you want love, give love.  If you want friends, be friendly.  If you want money, provide value.  It really is this simple.If there was ever a moment to follow your passion and do something that matters to you, that moment is now.And remember, the extra mile is the stretch of road that’s never crowded.  As long as you follow your heart and never stop learning, you’ll turn not older, but newer every day.Photo by: Moiht 6 Steps to True

BarrieA TragedyMy wife and I graduated from Keuka College, a beautiful college on Keuka Lake in New York.  Graduation weekend is always held on Memorial Day, so my family and my wife’s family decided to rent a house on the lake for the weekend.  Ever since then, we’ve made it an annual family tradition.  Every Memorial Day weekend we rent a house on the lake together as a family.In 2009 during our annual stay at the lake, through a long series of events that I feel were truly meant to be, our dog Athena ended up getting hit by a car and died.  Looking back it seems as if my whole life’s purpose flashed before my eyes in this one solitary moment.  The events and occurrences of my life up to that point seemed to fit together like an unsolved jigsaw puzzle – everything fit, but the message of the puzzle was still unclear.  But in that moment of tragedy, the different pieces came together in a more enlightening way than they ever had before.Needless to say it was a pretty sudden and unexpected death that affected my wife and me greatly.  I could not shake the feeling it was somehow meant to be and immediately tried to decipher why that was.  What I learned, summed up in one sentence is, “Life is too short not to follow your heart.”A New BeginningAnd this is what my blog is all about.  I decided that I wanted to spend more time with my wife and kids.  I wanted to work for myself and stop making other people rich from my efforts.  I came up with a plan to do this and I have now implemented it.This is not an easy thing to do.  Athena died almost two years ago.  This plan was supposed to be implemented within one year and I am just beginning to make significant progress now.  I feel a bit guilty I did not get it done sooner.  Unfortunately, life is like that.  We all have the best intentions, but ultimately life gets the best of us and we find ourselves 15 years later asking, “How did this happen?  Where did the time go?”In the end, happiness is different for everyone.  It could mean any number of things.  I am a firm believer that happiness is a choice we can make.  Whether it is being happy with our self, our spouse, our job or something else.  To find true happiness you have to follow your heart and intuition.  You have to be who you are and follow a lifestyle and career that fulfills you; no matter what that entails or what people say about it.  And it is never too late to do so.After Athena’s death, and in my search to help it all make sense, I put together a personal action plan that followed six simple steps.  It helped me take a snapshot of my life and analyze where I am now and where I want to go.  So I want to leave you with this 6 step process to getting what you want out of life.Create a mission statement. – Mine was simply “To translate what gives me joy, fulfillment and makes me genuinely happy into a career that will allow me to work for myself and spend more time with my family.”  This meant starting my own business as a coach to help individuals and small business owners get what they want out of their life and business.  Formulating this sentence allows us to create a short mission statement that summarizes exactly what we want from life, which will help to keep it in the forefront of our minds when we’re making important decisions.Make a list of your primary priorities. – This list will make your decisions easier as you will know what’s most important to you.  Anytime there is a conflict consult this list and make the decision based on your priorities.  Here is an example of my list: Family, Church, Health, Work / Money, Service to Others, Hobbies.Take an inventory. – List every single major entity in your life – the people, organizations, career, hobbies, and anything else you spend time on in your life.  Write a short summary of each.  Explain what each one means to you, what you get from it, and if you are neglecting other areas of your life because of it.Make decisions. – Take this list and make a decision on every aspect of your life.  Decide whether time you spend on certain activities could be spent helping you achieve goals in other areas of your life.  Decide if you will continue some activities, change others, or start a new one.  Time is the most precious commodity we have; do not waste it.Develop a plan. – Develop a game plan of what has to take place to reach your dreams and make things happen.  Setup measurable goals for your life.  Break it all down into time frames of a week, a month, a year and then longer – 5, 10, 20, 30 years out.  These will constantly change and evolve so check them and update them frequently.Schedule it, tell everyone and take action. – The most important step.  By scheduling your goals and your action items it allows you to set definite deadlines.  That gives you a better chance of sticking to it.  If you tell everyone what you are doing you are now creating ownership of your goals.  And of course nothing can stand in your way as long as you’re taking decisive action.  If you find yourself making excuses, stop!I know it may seem crazy that some dog changed my life, but it was the lessons I learned from Athena’s accident that changed my life.  We all learn differently.  And despite my loss, I’m grateful for the lessons and the opportunities that have risen from it.  If you’re looking for further guidance on creating happiness in your life I recommend the short but powerful book The Four Agreements.If you liked what you read here please feel free to visit Chris Gaddis’ website at chrisjgaddis.com and subscribe to his blog.  If some of you need assistance in creating your own Personal Action Plan he would be happy to e-mail you a copy of his.  Just email him at [email protected].Photo by: Luca Nicalli 365 Simple Pleasures to Brighten a Year|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/365-simple-pleasures.jpg?resize=500%2C334&ssl=1| 30 Ways to Make Today a Good Day|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/today-a-good-day.jpg?resize=500%2C357&ssl=1|One today is worth two tomorrows.-Benjamin FranklinYesterday is history and tomorrow is merely a figment of your imagination.  So if you think about it, today is the only day you’re truly alive.  Here’s how to make it a good one:Get started a few minutes early.Work on something that’s meaningful to you.Complete an important piece of unfinished business.Spend time with positive, friendly people.Do something nice for someone else.Be present.

"101 Short Stories that Will Leave You Smiling, Crying and Thinking|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/short-stories-mmt.jpg?resize=500%2C330&ssl=1| May your actions speak louder than your words. May your life preach louder than your lips. May your success be your noise in the end. The result of enormous success is often pretty noisy — lots of people talking, writing, and sharing stories about it. The actual process of achieving enormous success, on the other hand, is far more discreet. But it’s this process that happens quietly, behind-the-scenes, that makes all the difference in the world. Marc and I are fortunate enough to know a number of enormously successful human beings. Regardless of lifestyle, industry or profession, they share many of the same quiet habits. And that’s precisely what I want to discuss with you today. Here are twelve key things the most successful people we know do quietly and diligently: [Read more…]  Let’s cut to the chase today. What you ultimately do in life comes out of who you believe you are. You have to practice believing in yourself and ignoring the naysayers. Because while you may not be able to control the impolite and unfair things some people say and do, you can press forward and decide not to be endlessly derailed by them. Of course, I know that’s all much easier said than done, but you must remind yourself that it can be done! How? Start by leveraging the right daily affirmations. After all, it’s not what others say about you, and it’s not what you broadcast to everyone else that determines the trajectory of your life. It’s what you whisper to yourself behind [Read more…]  You ultimately become what you repeatedly do. If your habits aren’t helping you, they’re hurting you. Here are some fairly common and widespread examples of the latter that will drain all your joy if you let them: Try to use frustration and inconvenience to motivate you rather than annoy you. You are in control of the way you look at life. Instead of getting angry, find the lesson. In place of envy, feel admiration. In place of worry, take action. In place of doubt, have faith. Remember that your response is always more powerful than your present circumstance. A small part of your life is decided by completely uncontrollable circumstances, while the vast majority of your life is decided by your responses. Where you ultimately end up is heavily dependent on [Read more…]  A good morning, and thus a good day, aren’t just experiences that magically happen — they are created consciously. Most of us are distracted from the get-go every morning. Trivial activities like checking social media, watching TV, and worrying about things we can’t control often set the tone of the day. And that means we waste our most well-rested time on things that don’t matter, while gradually losing touch with the significant, controllable parts of our lives that actually do matter. We simply forget that the morning hours are enormously important — they form the foundation from which the day is built. We forget that how we choose to spend these hours can be used to predict the kind of days we’re going to have, and ultimately the kind of lives we’re going to live. So if you feel like you’ve been getting a rough start lately, and stumbling through your days with diminished intention and focus, it’s time to consider [Read more…]  Perhaps it takes courage to raise children… Our youth can’t possibly know how age thinks and feels. And likewise, as we age we are often guilty of being so busy-brained that we forget what it was like to be young. Spending time with my young son helps me tap into my younger mind — he keeps me on my toes. For that I am grateful, but I still struggle as a parent. I struggle to be present. I struggle to be patient. I struggle to remember. Almost every single day. Truth be told, every parent battles with parenthood in their own way. Because parenting is not easy. What helps me is journaling about the lessons parenthood is gradually teaching me, and then referring back to what I’ve learned when I’m struggling and forgetful. Today, I want to share some quotes from my parenting journal with you. Perhaps they will assist you someday, the way they have assisted me again this morning… [Read more…] The Only Way You Can Change The

Yourself 28 Dignified Ways to Impress Everyone Around You|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/ways-to-impress-everyone.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1|Far more often than any of us like to admit, our actions are driven by an inner desire to impress other people.  This desire is often reflected in the brand name products we use, the bars and restaurants we frequent, the houses and cars we buy and the careers we choose.But are name brand products, fancy bars, houses and cars really that impressive?  What about a person who holds an elite position in a career field they dislike?  Some of these things might capture our attention for a minute or two, but they won’t hold it for long.Why?  Because tangible possessions are not as impressive as intangible qualities.Consider the following questions:He drives a Porsche, but can he truly afford the car payment?He owns a big house, but is it a loving household?He makes a lot of money, but does he enjoy what he does for a living?You get the idea.  Whenever the answer to questions like these is ‘no,’ the subject who initially appeared to be impressive no longer does.Now take a moment and imagine a person who loves what he does for a living, smiles frequently and bleeds passion in every breath he takes.  Would he impress you?  Would it matter that he wasn’t a millionaire?Here are 28 dignified ways to impress everyone around you.  If you practice these tips on a regular basis, they won’t just impress others, they’ll help you become a better person too.We make a living by what we get.  We make a life by what we give.– Winston ChurchillBe authentic.  Be true to yourself. – Judy Garland once said, “Always be a first rate version of yourself instead of a second rate version of somebody else.”  Live by this statement.  There is no such thing as living in someone else’s shoes.  The only shoes you can occupy are your own.  If you aren’t being yourself, you aren’t truly living – you’re merely existing.  And ask yourself this:  If you don’t like who you really are, why should I like you?Care about people. – If you don’t genuinely care about people, they won’t care about you.  The more you help others, the more they will want to help you.  Love and kindness begets love and kindness.  And so on and so forth.Make others feel good. – People will rarely remember what you did, but they will always remember how you made them feel.Be honest and take ownership of your actions. – Nobody likes a liar.  In the long-run, the truth always reveals itself anyway.  Either you own up to your actions or your actions will ultimately own you.Smile often. – Everyone likes the sight of a genuine smile.  Think about how you feel when a complete stranger looks into your eyes and smiles.  Suddenly they don’t seem like a stranger anymore, do they?Respect elders.  Respect minors.  Respect everyone. – There are no boundaries or classes that define a group of people that deserve to be respected.  Treat everyone with the same level of respect you would give to your grandfather and the same level of patience you would have with your baby brother.  People will notice your kindness.Address people by their name. – People love the sight and sound of their own name.  So make sure you learn to remember names.  Use them courteously in both oral and written communication.Say “Please” and “Thank you.” – These two simple phrases make demands sound like requests, and they inject a friendly tone into serious conversations.  Using them can mean the difference between sounding rude and sounding genuinely grateful.Excel at what you do. – I am impressed by great guitarists, writers, bloggers, painters, motivational speakers, internet entrepreneurs, computer engineers, mothers, fathers, athletes, etc.  There is only one thing they all have in common: They excel at what they do.  There’s no point in doing something if you aren’t going to do it right.  Excel at your work and excel at your hobbies.  Develop a reputation for yourself, a reputation for consistent excellence.Help others when you’re able. – In life, you get what you put in.  When you make a positive impact in someone else’s life, you also make a positive impact in your own life.  Do something that’s greater than you – something that helps someone else to be happy or to suffer less.  Everyone values the gift of unexpected assistance and those who supply it.Put a small personal touch on everything you do. – Think of it as branding your work.  If you’re funny, add a little humor into it.  If you’re an artist, decorate it with illustrations.  Whatever you do, customize it with a little personal touch of ‘you.’Over-deliver on all of your promises. – Some people habitually make promises they are just barely able to fulfill.  They promise perfection and deliver mediocrity.  If you want to boost your personal value in the eyes of others, do the exact opposite.  Slightly under-sell your capabilities so that you’re always able to over-deliver.  It will seem to others like you’re habitually going above and beyond the call of duty.Get organized. – How can you get anything accomplished if you aren’t organized?  You can’t.  Make a regular habit of organizing your living space and working space.  For some practical organizational guidance, I recommend David Allen’s Getting Things Done.Do your research and ask clarifying questions. – Don’t be that clueless dude in the room who just nods like he knows what’s going on.  Prepare yourself by doing research ahead of time.  And if something still doesn’t make sense to you, ask questions.  The people involved will respect your desire to understand the material.Share knowledge and information with others. – When you can, be a resource to those around you.  If you have access to essential information, don’t hoard it.  Share it openly.Be positive and focus on what’s right. – Everything that happens in life is neither good nor bad.  It just depends on your perspective.  And no matter how it turns out, it always ends up just the way it should.  Either you succeed or you learn something.  So stay positive, appreciate the pleasant outcomes, and learn from the rest.  Your positivity will rub off on everyone around you.Listen intently to what others have to say. – Eyes focused, ears tuned, mobile phone off.  In a world that can’t move fast enough, someone who can find time to listen to others is always appreciated.Be faithful to your significant other. – Tiger Woods was everyone’s hero until recently, wasn’t he?  Sustained fidelity in a long-term intimate relationship is not only impressive, it creates a healthy foundation for everything else you do.Learn to appreciate and love Mother Nature. – Those who truly appreciate and love the natural world surrounding us typically exhibit the same high regard for all humanity.  It’s a positive way to live, and it’s something people notice.Invest time, energy and money in yourself every day. – When you invest in yourself, you can never lose, and over time you will change the trajectory of your life.  You are simply the product of what you know.  The more time, energy and money you spend acquiring pertinent knowledge, the more control you have over your life and the more valuable you will be to everyone around you.  For fresh ideas on self improvement and lifestyle design, I recommend The 4-Hour Workweek.Perform random acts of kindness on a regular basis. – Pay for a stranger’s coffee in line at Starbucks.  Buy the office receptionist flowers just to say, “Thank you.”  Help an elderly lady with her groceries.  There’s nothing more rewarding than putting smiles on the faces around you.Compliment people who deserve it. – Go out of your way to personally acknowledge and complement the people who have gone out of their way to shine.  Everybody likes to hear that their efforts are appreciated.Speak clearly and make eye contact. – Most people have a very low tolerance for dealing with people they can’t understand.  Mystery does not fuel strong relationships and impressiveness.  Also, there’s little doubt that eye contact is one of the most captivating forms of personal communication.  When executed properly, eye contact injects closeness into human interaction.Make yourself available and approachable. – If people cannot get a hold of you, or have trouble approaching you, they will forget about you.  Your general availability and accessibility to others is extremely important to them.  Always maintain a positive, tolerant attitude and keep an open line of communication to those around you.Be self-sufficient. – Freedom is the greatest gift.  Self-sufficiency is the greatest freedom.  And self-sufficiency is quite impressive too.   In the business world, it’s one of the primary dreams that inspire people to give-up their day jobs to pursue entrepreneurship.Exploit the resources you do have access to. – The average person is usually astonished when they see a physically handicap person show intense signs of emotional happiness.  How could someone in such a restricted physical state be so happy?  The answer rests in how they use the resources they do have.  Stevie Wonder couldn’t see, so he exploited his sense of hearing into a passion for music, and he now has 25 Grammy Awards to prove it.Be a part of something you believe in. – This could be anything.  Some people take an active role in their local city council, some find refuge in religious faith, some join social clubs supporting causes they believe in, and others find passion in their careers.  In each case the psychological outcome is the same.  They engage themselves in something they strongly believe in.  This engagement brings happiness and meaning into their lives.  It’s hard not to be impressed by someone who’s passionate about what they’re doing.Stand up for your beliefs without flaunting them. – Yes, it is possible to stand up for your beliefs without foisting them down someone else’s throat.  Discuss your personal beliefs when someone asks about them, but don’t spawn offensive attacks of propaganda on unsuspecting victims.  Stand firm by your values and always keep an open mind to new information.Of course, the coolest thing about this list is that everything you need to impress everyone around you is already contained within you.  So stop trying to impress people with the possessions you own and start inspiring them with who you are and how you live your life.Photo by: Khalid Where We Must Go When We Feel Lost and Alone|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/lost-and-alone.jpg?resize=500%2C347&ssl=1|What She Desires MostShe notices the people sitting in a small sports bar across the street.  They’re cheering and chatting.  They look so alive.  She wants to cross the street and join these people just to connect with them – to be a part of something.  But a subtle voice that comes from within – that whispers from the open wounds in her heart – holds her back from doing so.  So she keeps walking.  Alone.She walks to the end of the city center where she sees a dirt path that leads up a grassy hill.  The hill, she knows, overlooks a spiritual sanctuary.  But it isn’t the sanctuary she wants to visit tonight – not yet anyway.  It’s a warm, breezy Saturday night and she wants to find a place outdoors with sufficient light so she can sit and read the novel she’s grasping in her right hand.But reading isn’t what she really wants.  Not deep down.  What she really wants is for someone – anyone at all – to tap her on the shoulder and invite her into their world.  To ask her questions and tell her stories.  To be interested.  To laugh with her.  To want her to be a part of their life.But it isn’t even this connection with someone new that she wants most.  At least not at the deepest level.  At the deepest level, in the core of her soul, even fleeting connections with others seem to interfere with what she desires most.  Which is to know that she’s truly loved.  That she’s not alone in this world.  And that whatever she was put here to do, in time, will be done and shared with others who care.UnsustainableThis young woman left a substantial segment of her life behind to be in this small city tonight.  A few months ago, she was engaged to a strapping young businessman, managing a fast-growing start-up company, working long, hard days and enjoying the fruits of her labor together with a deepening community of friendships in Manhattan.In a period of just a few months, her fiancé and her split and decided that it was easiest to shutdown the company and divide the monetary remains rather than attempt co-ownership.  As they began the process of shutting down the company, she learned that most of the seemingly deep friendships she had made in Manhattan were tied directly to her old business affairs or her business-socialite of an ex-fiancé.While this young woman didn’t consciously expect such a rapid, tragic series of events, it also wasn’t totally unexpected.  Subconsciously she knew that she had created a life for herself that was unsustainable.  It was a life revolving around her social status in which all of her relationships brought with them a mounting and revolving set of expectations.  This life left no time for spiritual growth or true love.Yet, this young woman is drawn to spirituality and love.  She has been drawn to both all her life.  And the only thing that steered her off course into this unsustainable lifestyle was the imprudent belief that if she did certain things and acted in certain ways she would be worthy in the eyes of others.  That her social status would procure love from these people.  And that she would never be alone.She realizes, now, how wrong she was.The SanctuaryThe young woman walks up a steep paved road on the outskirts of the city center.  She feels the burn in her quads as she marches higher and higher.  The road is, at first, filled with quaint boutique shops and young couples and friends, but as it advances uphill they give way to small cottage homes and kids playing ball in the street.  She keeps marching higher and higher until she reaches a clearing where there is a small public park.In this park, a group of teenagers huddle around two guitarists who are strumming and singing an acoustic melody.  “Is it a popular song?” she thinks to herself.  She isn’t sure because she hasn’t had time lately to listen to music.  She wants to join the group.  She wants to tell the guitarists that their music is incredible.  But she hesitates.  She just can’t find the courage to walk over to them.Instead, she sits on a park bench a few hundred feet away.  The bench overlooks the cityscape below.  She stares off into the distance and up into the night sky for several minutes – thinking and breathing.  And she begins to smile, because she can see the spiritual sanctuary.  It’s dark outside, but the sanctuary shines bright.  She can see it clearly.  She can feel it’s warmth surrounding her.  And although she knows the sanctuary has existed for an eternity, her heart tells her something that keeps a smile stretched across her cheeks: “This sanctuary is all yours tonight.”Not in the sense that she owns it.  Nor in the sense that it isn’t also a sanctuary for millions of other people around the world.  But rather in the sense that it belongs to all of us as part of our heritage, exclusively tailored for every human being and our unique needs and beliefs.  It’s a quiet refuge that, when we choose to pay attention, exists all around us and within us.  We can escape to it at any time.  It’s a place where we can dwell with the good spirits and guardian angels who love us unconditionally and guide us even when we feel lost and alone.Especially when we feel lost and alone.Photo by: Meg Wills 75 Ways To Stay Unhappy Forever|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/unhappy-forever.jpg?resize=500%2C404&ssl=1|Dale Carnegie once said, “It isn’t what you have, or who you are, or where you are, or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy.  It’s what you think about.”I don’t think anyone could say it any better than that.  I’ve watched so many friends search tirelessly for happiness by changing jobs, moving to new cities, pursuing intimate relationships, and tweaking all sorts of other external factors in their lives.  And guess what?  They’re still unhappy.  Because they spend all of their time and money adding positive externals to their lives when their internals are still in the negatives.So with that in mind, here are 75 ways to stay unhappy forever.  Of course, I would highly recommend you read each bullet point and then move swiftly in the opposite direction.Dwell on things that happened in the past.Obsess yourself with all the things that might happen in the future.Complain about problems instead of taking the necessary steps to resolve them.Fear change and resist it.Work hard, do your best and then condemn yourself for not achieving perfection.Belittle yourself.Hang out with other people who belittle you.Try to control everything and then worry about the things you can’t control.Lie to yourself and those around you.Keep doing the same thing over and over again.Be lazy and follow the path of least resistance.Hold onto anger.  Never forgive anyone.Always be right.  Never let anyone else be more right than you.Compare yourself unfavorably to those who you feel are more successful.Let small issues snowball into big problems.Never learn anything new.Never take responsibility for your own actions.Blame everyone around you.Don’t ask for directions and don’t ask questions.Don’t let anyone help you.Quit when the going gets tough.Be suspicious.  Trust no one.Get four hours of sleep every night and convince yourself that it’s enough.Never throw anything way.  Even if you don’t use it, hold onto it.Say “yes” to everyone.  Fill all your time with commitments.Try to be everyone’s friend.Multitask, multitask, multitask!  Do everything at once.Never spend any time alone.Don’t help others unless you have to.  Do only the things that benefit you directly.Hang out with people who complain about everything.Focus on what you don’t want to happen.Fear the things you don’t fully understand.Always seek external validation before you consider yourself good enough.Take everything and everyone in life seriously.Spend your life working in a career field you aren’t passionate about.Focus on the problems.Think about all the things you don’t have.Read or watch lots of depressing news from broadcast media.Set lofty goals for yourself and never do anything to achieve them.Never exercise.Only eat junk food and fried food.Never check-up on your health.Setup your lifestyle so it revolves around money.Spend more than you earn and rack up lots of financial debt.Don’t say what you mean.  Don’t mean what you say.Frown.Never tell anyone how you feel or what you’re thinking.Make sure everything you do impresses someone else.Always put your own needs on the back burner.Get involved in other people problems and make them your own.Make others feel bad about themselves.Watch TV for several hours every day.Gamble often.Stay in the same place.  Don’t travel.Don’t play, just work.Let your hobbies go.Let your close relationships go.Never finish what you start.Take everything personally.Do lots of drugs.  Drink lots of alcohol.Never say, “I’m sorry.”  Never say, “I love you.”Don’t work hard at anything.Always wait until the last minute.Believe that, no matter what, you are entitled to things.Let others make decisions for you.Remember the insults.  Forget the compliments.Let it all bottle up inside.Rely on others for everything.Fail to plan.Don’t dream.Don’t think about the future at all.Always disregard other people’s opinions and suggestions.Make promises you can’t keep.Don’t decide on anything, ever.Just keep going and going and going.  And never ever stop.And now that you know what not to do, let me tell you a secret about happiness.  Nobody is happy all of the time.  It’s perfectly normal to experience considerable fluctuations in your level of happiness from day to day, month to month, and even year to year.In fact, according to a recent scientific study, overall levels of happiness decline from one’s teens until one’s 40s and then pick up again until they peak in one’s early 70s.  So the chances are that your happiest days are yet to come.  Hopefully that gives you something to smile about.Photo by: Helga Weber "
"Why I Live Every Day Like It’s My Last|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/live-every-day.jpg?resize=475%2C266&ssl=1|Laugh with every breath.Love as long as you live.This post has moved to HERE:5 “Notes to Self” About the Precious Little Time You Have Left  22 Tools You Should Keep in Your Car|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/tools-cars.jpg?resize=464%2C308&ssl=1|“Always be prepared!”  That’s the Boy Scout motto.  Most people keep their tools at home.  But if you aren’t at home, you probably drove your car to get to wherever you are.Here are 22 useful tools you should keep in your car.2-3 Gallons of Water – You can drink it when you’re thirsty, use it as a cleaning/rinsing agent, pour it into your car’s cooling system if it’s overheating, etc.Portable GPS – Being lost is not a fun feeling.  A GPS basically eliminates this possibility.  During a recent spring vacation to Costa Rica our Garmin GPS pretty much saved our rear ends on multiple occasions.Hand Sanitizer – Because there isn’t a sink and a bar of soap conveniently located in your car.  In my mind, hand sanitizer is a tool, a tool that prevents me from infecting my body with germs on a daily basis.  Keep yourself healthy!  Sanitize your hands regularly… especially before you eat.Multi-head Screwdriver – Take a look around.  I bet most of the manmade objects around you are being held together by screws.  Throughout your lifetime you’re going to need to tighten and loosen a whole lot of them.  And you won’t always be near your tool chest when these occasions arise.  Keep decent multi-head screwdriver with a wide assortment of screwdriver heads in your car and you’ll be prepared.Adjustable Wrench – If screws aren’t holding it together then nuts and bolts almost certainly are.  You will eventually need to adjust the bolts on office furniture, your vehicle, and other objects when you’re out and about.  A basic 3-piece adjustable wrench set should fit the bill just fine.Pliers – Your hands are not the most effective tool for gripping and maneuvering small objects.  That’s where pliers come in handy.  One set of pliers will not do the trick either. You’ll likely need a small assortment of pliers in various styles and sizes for different kinds of jobs.  At a minimum, keep a needle-nose, a heavy grooved, and a wire cutting pliers in your trunk.Hammer – The single greatest tool of all time.  The hammer has an infinite set of practical applications.  A good old 16 oz claw hammer will provide a lifetime of reliable service.Pen and Notepad – If you don’t write it down, you will forget it.  Regular note-taking is one of the most productive habits a person can practice.  Keep a pen and notepad in your car so you can jot down key ideas and information as they cross your mind.First Aid Kit – Human beings are not made of titanium.  When you or someone you care about gets injured, a basic first aid kit becomes the single most important thing you own.  And what good is a first aid kit that’s sitting at home when you’re not at home?Hands Free Set for Your Cell Phone – Why would any sane person drive one-handed while holding an odd shaped phone to their ear when they have the option to use a hands free set?Multi-Use Car Charger – Some multi-use car chargers (like this one) allow you to charge up to four devices at once.  This unit turns one auto cigarette lighter port into two, has two USB charging ports, and provides a heavy-duty 20 amp capacity.  Now you can charge your iPhone, iPod, and other electronics on the go.Prepaid Calling Card – A calling card basically allows you to call anyone, anywhere from any telephone.  They are particularly convenient when you misplace your cell phone or when you’re in an area that lacks cell service.Duct Tape – If it’s moving and it shouldn’t be, duct tape it.  Duct tape may very well be the second greatest invention after the hammer.Quality Sunglasses – Most people consider sight to be their most important sense.  Quality sunglasses protect the human eyes from being destroyed by the sun’s ultraviolet radiation.  This radiation can lead to short-term and long-term ocular problems such as cataracts, blindness and various forms of eye cancer.  So wear sunglasses when you’re out in the sunlight.Work Gloves – Unfortunately, human hands are covered with fragile skin just like the rest of the body.  Sometimes you need to use your hands to accomplish a task that requires a durability threshold beyond that of your exposed skin.  This is where a rugged set of work gloves saves you from a few days worth of blistering agony.Wind-up LED Flashlight – What happens if your car stalls at night on a dark road?  What happens if you need to search for something in a dark utility closet at work?  Always keep a wind-up LED flashlight (no batteries required) in your automobile.Rubber Bands – Rubber bands are simple, functional and versatile.  There is an endless list of practical uses for a rubber band.USB Flash Drive – One of the most practical accessories for a computer.  I can’t even count the number of times I’ve used my 16 gig flash drive to save some data from someone else’s system.  A USB flash drive is an essential tool you always need to have on you.Small Fire Extinguisher – This one is a no-brainer.  Completely useless until the moment the sh*t hits the fan and the world around you is burning to the ground.  If you don’t keep a fire extinguisher handy, you’re being foolishly optimistic.Leatherman – This is the all-in-one multi-tool you should never leave home without.  These little tools can handle a plethora of different jobs.  I personally own the Leatherman 830039 and I love it.Bungee Cords – Tie things down, wrap things together… Bungee cords are like giant rubber bands with hooks.  They’re darn practical to have out on the road when you need them!Spare Credit Card and Cash – Let’s go back to the Boy Scout motto again: “Always be prepared.”  If you lose your wallet when you’re out and about, it’s always nice to have a back-up plan.While I’m sure this list could be expanded, these 22 tools are the tools I keep in my car.  And each of them has served me well over the years, saving me lots of frustration in my moments of need.Photo by: Viernest How To Achieve The Impossible|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/achieve-the-impossible.jpg?resize=464%2C309&ssl=1|The impossible is what nobody can do until somebody does.Teleportation is the new air travel.  Humans can walk on water.  And there is a cure for cancer.  These things will happen eventually because, quite simply, the nature of progression dictates that they must happen.  And because there are people on this planet who believe they can make them happen.Are you one of these people?3 Short Stories on Achieving the ImpossibleWhen I was a high school freshman, a 260 pound freshman girl showed up for track and field try-outs.  Her name was Sara, and she was only there because her doctor said her health depended on it.  But once she scanned the crowd of students who were trying-out, she turned around and began walking away. Coach O’Leary saw her, jogged over, and turned her back around.  “I’m not thin enough for this sport!” Sara declared.  “And I’ll never be!  It’s impossible for me to lose enough weight.  I’ve tried.”  Coach O’Leary nodded, and promised Sara that her body type wasn’t suited for her current weight.  “It’s suited for 220 pounds,” he said.  Sara looked confused.  “Most people tell me I need to lose 130 pounds,” she replied.  “But you think I only need to lose 40?”  Coach O’Leary nodded again.  Sara started off as a shot put competitor, but spent every single afternoon running and training with the rest of the track team.  She was very competitive, and by the end of our freshman year she was down to 220 pounds.  She also won 2nd place in the county-wide shot put tournament that year.  Three years later, during our senior year, she won 3rd place in the 10K run.  Her competitive weight at the time was 130 pounds.When Charles Darwin wrote The Origin of Species, which proposed the groundbreaking idea of evolution by natural selection, it launched a worldwide debate.  Supporters included scientists, historians, and others whose professions and worldviews required that they carefully analyze new ideas and adopt those that seemed to make sense.  Critics included theologians, conservative extremists, and others who were convinced that the current explanation of our ancestry was the only possible explanation.  This group of people, the ones who refused to accept the possibility of new ideas, eventually alienated themselves from the debate, and arguably failed to assist in the progression of mankind.  The people who didn’t blindly reject evolution, who instead questioned it, researched it, and sought to explore its possibilities, were able to achieve previously impossible feats by making important advances in various fields of study from sociology to history to medicine.When Sergey Brin and Larry Page founded Google, they had absolutely no intention of building the most powerful Internet-based company in the world.  In the mid 1990’s the Internet was already saturated with hundreds of established search engine companies like Yahoo, Lycos, and Alta Vista.  Competing and succeeding in such a competitive environment seemed impossible to them.  So instead, they tried to sell their search technology to these companies.  And although Google, with its PageRank algorithm and efficient scaling, was clearly more cutting-edge than any search technology currently in place, none of these established companies wanted to get their hands dirty with Google’s new technology.  So after exhausting their options, Brin and Page decided to release Google to the public and directly compete with the biggest names in the business.  As we know, they blew them out of the water.‘Impossible’ is Simply a State of MindIf we can find the patience to see the world for what it is – dynamic, flexible, and loaded with untapped potential – and if we can accept the fact that change is an inevitable and brilliant part of life, then we can partake in the thrill of progression, and help shape a world in which the impossible becomes possible.To achieve the impossible, we must first understand that the ‘state of impossible’ is simply a ‘state of mind.’  Nothing is truly impossible.  Impossibility only exists when we lack the proper knowledge and experience to comprehend how something can be possible.Sara was convinced that it was impossible to lose weight because, in her past experience, it had never worked-out the way she had hoped.  19th-century theologians laughed at Charles Darwin’s theories because his theories didn’t come from the Bible, which, at the time, was their sole source of knowledge and truth.  Google’s old competitors didn’t recognize the next big thing when it was offered to them on a silver platter.  Why?  Because they didn’t want to bother with a new technology that they didn’t fully understand.  This ultimately forced Google’s Brin and Page to achieve their version of the ‘impossible.’ConclusionWhen people say something is impossible, what they really mean is, “I can’t imagine how it could be possible.”  But with more knowledge and experience, they’d begin to realize that anything is possible, it just takes a change in mindset.  Because ‘impossible’ is what we get when we haven’t trained our minds and our hearts to see past the systems that currently exist to ones that don’t yet exist.So let’s start the training our minds and our hearts, today, so we can turn today’s impossibility into tomorrow’s possibility.Photo by: Rajeshvj This Is Why You Are In Debt|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/why-youre-in-debt.jpg?resize=464%2C304&ssl=1|The only way to get out of debt is to understand why you’re in debt in the first place.And the truth is…You will not save money when you get your next raise.  You will not save money when your car is paid off.  You will not save money when your kids are supporting themselves someday.  And you wouldn’t even save a dime if I handed you $100,000 in cash right now.How do I know this?Because saving money has very little to do with the amount of money you have.  In fact, you will only start to save money when saving becomes an emotional habit – when you start treating the money you handle everyday differently.So this is why you are in debt:You buy miscellaneous crap you don’t need or use. – Stop buying ‘stuff’ on impulse!  Avoid the mall!  The mall is not a source for entertainment.  It’s a source for personal debt.  There’s no reason to tease yourself by staring at a bunch of brand new crap you don’t need.  And as you know, the novelty of a new purchase wears thin long before the credit card bill arrives.You use credit to purchase things you can’t afford to buy in cash. – If you can’t pay for it in cash today, don’t buy it today!  It’s as simple as that.You think of certain product brands as fashionable status symbols. – A car gets you from point ‘A’ to point ‘B.’  A purse holds your personal belongings.  A pair of sunglasses shades your eyes from the sun.  A shirt keeps you warm.  If you’re paying premium prices just to get a fashionable brand name labeled on each these products without any regard for how well the products actually serve their practical purpose, you have a problem.You buy a brand new car every few years. – See my previous point.  A car is a means of transportation to get you from one place to another.  If you’re buying a new car every few years even when your old car works fine, you’re likely trying too hard to impress the wrong people… and you’re going broke in the process.You buy things you could have borrowed from a friend or rented. – After you bought that DVD, how many times did you actually watch it?  Do you really want a 20 inch chainsaw collecting dust in your garage?  So you own a pressure washer you only use once every three years?  You get the point… borrow and rent when it makes sense.You pay retail prices on everything you buy. – If you’re paying retail prices, you’re getting screwed.  You can easily save well over $1000 a year on general purchases by waiting for sales and shopping at discount outlets.You own (or rent) way more house than you need. – When you buy or rent a house that’s bigger than you need, you end up wasting lots of money on larger monthly payments, higher upkeep costs, higher utility bills, and lots of random ‘stuff’ to fill up the extra empty space.You don’t follow any sort of formal budgeting plan. – Do you assume that if you wait around and make more money your finances and credit debt will magically resolve themselves?  I’m sorry to say, you’re dead wrong!  It takes a lot of planning and proactive budgeting to erase a pile of debt and build a nest egg of wealth.  So start now!You don’t automate 401K or savings deposits. – We’re ten years into the new millennium.  If you aren’t using simple technology to automate savings deposits, you pretty much deserve to be broke.You don’t leverage the small investments you do have. – You have to give your money the opportunity to make money.  Any capital you do have, no matter how small, should be invested using a basic, long-term investment strategy.  If your capital isn’t invested, it’s just losing value as inflation rises.You’re married to (or dating) a spend-thrift. – You’ll never get out of debt if you’re married to a person who spends every dime you make.  So help your soul mate become financially responsible, or except life in the poorhouse.You’ve never educated yourself on basic money management. – Responsible money management is not an innate human instinct.  You have to properly educate yourself.  If you don’t, you’ll stay exactly where you are now, in debt.You have a ‘get rich quick’ mentality. – For 99.99% of us, wealth doesn’t come instantly.  You’re far more likely to be struck by lightning twice than win the lottery once.  If you’re spending your time and money on a ‘get rich quick’ scheme, the debt will just keep piling up.You have nasty, money-sucking (and life-sucking) habits. – Smoking, drinking and gambling are all perfect examples of bad habits in which you choose to trade short term pleasure for long term debt and discomfort.  So light one up, shoot one down, and toss another chip across the table.  It’s only your life.You waste too much of your own time. – They say “time is money,” but I think time is way more valuable than money.  It’s the single greatest constituent of life.  If you fail to properly manage your time, you’ll absolutely fail to properly manage your money… and you’ll likely fail in every other aspect of your life as well.  So focus your time and energy on the important stuff and forget the rest.You aren’t taking care of your health. – Keep your body and mind healthy!  Major medical problems drain back accounts, increase insurance rates, keep you from working and earning money, and generally guarantee that you will have long-term financial problems.You aren’t enjoying life’s (free) simple pleasures. – The best things in life are free.  Stop wasting your money on second-rate entertainment and take a good look around you.  Mother Nature offers lots of entertainment free of charge.  Go hiking, go skinny dipping, play in the rain, build a bonfire with your friends, watch the sunset with your lover, etc.You went through an unfortunate divorce. – This final point might seem cruel, but it’s impossible to discuss the major reasons why people accumulate financial debt without mentioning divorce.  Divorce absolutely destroys the finances of both parties involved.  So the best advice I can give you is:  Don’t get married until you’re certain you want to spend the rest of your life with your significant other.  And don’t get a divorce until you’ve truly exhausted all of your other possible options (marriage therapy, etc.).Please remember, financial debt can be avoided and erased.  It just takes a little effort, education, and determination on your end to make it possible.  So as I’ve said before, live a comfortable life, not a wasteful one.  Do not spend to impress others.  Do not live life trying to fool yourself into thinking wealth is measured in material objects.  Manage your money wisely so your money does not manage you.  And always live well below your means. 40 Modern Nonfiction Books Everyone Should Read|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/nonfiction-books-everyone-should-read.jpg?resize=464%2C356&ssl=1|I credit a fraction of who I am today to each of these books.  Many of these titles challenged my internal status quo, opening my mind to new ideas and opportunities.  And together, they gave me a basic framework for living, loving, learning and working successfully.If you haven’t taken the time to read them, do yourself a favor and do so.  It will be time well spent.The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck – Pretty much the granddaddy of all self-improvement books, it’s easily one of the best nonfiction works I’ve ever read.  By melding love, science, and spirituality into a primer for personal growth, Peck guides the reader through lessons on delaying gratification, accepting responsibility for decisions, dedicating oneself to truth and reality, and creating a balanced lifestyle.Radical Honesty by Brad Blanton – The book’s basic point is sound – honesty is the best policy.  With a brash, ‘in your face’ writing style, Blanton states that lying is the primary cause of human stress and advocates strict truthfulness as the key to achieving intimacy in relationships and happiness in life.The Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin – Josh Waitzkin transformed himself from a championship chess master into an elite Tai Chi martial arts practitioner.  This book is part autobiography, part chess memoir, and part martial arts philosophy.  Essentially, Waitzkin offers his own approach to becoming a student and applying certain disciplines and habits toward learning and eventually mastering any skill.Scratch Beginnings: Me, $25, and the Search for the American Dream by Adam Shepard – Shepard started his life over from scratch in Charleston, South Carolina, with $25 and the clothes on his back.  He lived in a homeless shelter while looking for work.  His goal was to start with nothing and, within a year, work hard enough to save $2500, buy a car, and to live in a furnished apartment.  “Scratch Beginnings” is sometimes sad, sometimes amusing, pointed and thought provoking – all the makings of a book well worth reading.The Joy of Simple Living by Jeff Davidson – A great resource for anyone wanting to cut down on the clutter and confusion in their life.  Davidson takes a step-by-step, easy to follow approach to simplifying your house, garage, office, car, etc.  Not only will you learn to create an orderly home, you’ll gain the knowledge necessary to be a more successful spouse, parent, and worker by learning how to prioritize and simplify.Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert Cialdini – Arguably the best book on the science of persuasion.  Cialdini explains the six psychological principles that drive our powerful impulse to comply to the pressures of others and shows how we can defend ourselves against manipulation (or put these principles to work for our own interests).Secrets of the Millionaire Mind by T. Harv Ecker – This book competently discusses the missing link between wanting success and achieving it.  If you suspect that your mindset is holding you back from making more money and achieving your goals, you’d be wise to give this title a thorough read.Management of the Absurd by Richard Farson – Farson zeros in on the paradoxes of communication, the politics of management, and the dilemmas of change, exploring relationships within organizations and offering a unique perspective on the challenges managers face.  I highly recommend this book for anyone in a management or leadership role, including parents and teachers.Overachievement by John Eliot – According to Eliot, in order to achieve spectacular success, one must change his or her thoughts about pressure and learn to welcome it, enjoy it, and make it work.  Eliot says that goal-setting, relaxation, and visualization, the typical self-help suggestions, just don’t work well for most people.  This book provides some great food for thought that attempts to counteract the primary points of other major self-help gurus.The Magic of Thinking Big by David Schwartz – This is another classic self-improvement book.  Schwartz gives the reader useful, proactive steps for achieving success.  He presents a clear-cut program for getting the most out of your job, marriage, family life, and other relationships.  In doing so, he proves that you don’t need to be an intellectual or have innate talent to attain great success and satisfaction in life.An Incomplete Education: 3,684 Things You Should Have Learned but Probably Didn’t by Judy Jones – Simply fun and insightful, this book is truly a wonderful supplement to any person’s mental knowledgebase.  It’s basically an intellectual outline of history with a lot of helpful charts and guides.  It’s written in a very humorous tone and nails the humor attempts more often than not.  Whether you’re interested in a ‘refresher’ or just a quick briefing on an academic area you never had time for, this book is for you.  It’s not in depth, but it does tell you what you should know in all areas, including history, philosophy, music, art, and even film.How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie – Easily one of the best and most popular books on people-skills ever written.  Carnegie uses his adept storytelling skills to illustrate how to be successful by making the most of human relations.How to Talk to Anyone by Leil Lowndes – Another practical book about conversational people skills.  Lowndes helps the reader discover how to make small talk work, how to break the ice, how to network at a party, how to use body language to captivate your audience, and much more.The Irresistible Offer by Mark Joyner – Create an irresistible offer.  Present it to people who need it.  And sell it almost instantly.  A great sales and marketing primer for anyone trying to sell something.Nickel and Dimed by Barbara Ehrenreich – This is the book that provoked Adam Shepard to write “Scratch Beginnings.”  It’s another first person perspective on poverty in America.  In the book, Ehrenreich moves into a trailer and works as a waitress, hotel maid, and Wal-Mart sales clerk.  Nickel and Dimed reveals low-rent America in all its tenacity, anxiety, and duality.  I found it to be an extremely thought-provoking read.The Power of Less by Leo Babuta – Babuta’s message is simple:  Identify the essential.  Eliminate the rest.  Get on your way to living a simpler life in order to do and achieve the things that are of real value to you and your family.  This is my favorite book on the art of simplicity.Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell – Gladwell embarks on an intellectual journey to figure out what separates the best, the brightest, and the most successful people from everyone else.  He investigates these high achievers by looking closely at their culture, family, generation, and the individual experiences of their upbringing.  This book really gets you thinking about success from a totally different perspective.Freakonomics by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner – This book just may redefine the way you look at the modern world.  Through skillful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and Dubner set out to explore the hidden side of everything from the inner workings of a crack gang to the myths of political campaign finance to the true importance or unimportance of gun control.  It’s an eye-opening read.Maximum Achievement by Brian Tracy – This book is probably exactly what you would expect from a well-written, classic self-improvement book.  Tracy’s straightforward advice is accompanied by easy-to-do exercises and enhanced with inspiring stories of successful, highly motivated achievers in many fields.You, Inc.: The Art of Selling Yourself by Harry Beckwith – Beckwith concentrates on the importance of being a considerate human being as it relates to running a successful business or living a successful life.  The title is somewhat deceiving because the book is more about giving than it is about selling… or should I say, it’s about giving as a way to sell yourself.  Either way, this book is packed with practical tips and insightful stories.Getting Things Done by David Allen – The ultimate ‘organize your life’ book.  Allen’s ideas and processes are for all those people who are overwhelmed with too many things to do, too little time to do them, and a general sense of unease that something important is being missed.  The primary goal of this book is to teach you how to effectively get your ‘to-do inbox’ to empty.The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit by Seth Godin – Godin challenges the age old idea that winners never quit.  He states that every new project or career starts out exciting and fun.  Then it gets hard and less fun, until it hits a low point – and at that point you have to figure out if you’re in a dip or at a dead-end.  This book provides a look at how the market actually expects people to quit and what to do about it.  It’s a short and insightful read.Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely – Looks at the reasons so many of us continuously make irrational decisions on a daily basis.  It’s a scientific but easily readable and unquestionably insightful look about why we do what we do on a daily basis, and why we never change our ways even though we often ‘know better.’The Smartest Investment Book You’ll Ever Read by Daniel R. Solin – A short, no-fluff guide to investing.  Solin provides an easy-to-follow four step plan that allows investors to create and monitor their portfolios in 90 minutes or less per year, explaining how to asses risk and how to allocate assets to maximize returns and minimize volatility.  This book was absolutely invaluable to me when I first started investing my money.The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey – A classic self-improvement book.  Covey presents a principle-centered approach for solving personal and professional problems by delivering a step-by-step guide for living with integrity and honesty and adapting to the inevitable change life brings us everyday.  It’s a must-read.Made to Stick by Chip Heath and Dan Heath – Why do some ideas and stories thrive while others die?  And how do we improve the chances that our ideas and stories will catch on with others?  Heath and Heath tackle these questions head-on.  This book is extremely entertaining, while simultaneously providing practical, tangible strategies for makings things stick.Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser – “What we eat has changed more in the last forty years than in the last forty thousand,” Schlosser observes, yet most Americans know very little about how that food is made, where, by whom, and at what cost.  In a wonderfully horrifying way, this book exposes the American fast food industry’s evil side.  It’s a true eye-opener.Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert – Gilbert, a Harvard professor of psychology has studied happiness for decades, and he shares scientific findings that just might change the way you look at the world.  His primary goal is to persuade you into accepting the fact that happiness is not really what or where you imagined it would be.  This is my favorite book on happiness by a long shot.The Wisdom of Crowds by James Surowiecki – Surowiecki argues that “under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably intelligent, and are often smarter than the smartest people in them.”  He uses statistical examples to backup this theory.  For example: “…the TV studio audience of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire guesses correctly 91 percent of the time, compared to ‘experts’ who guess only 65 percent correctly.”  Hmm… perhaps this is why Wikipedia is so successful.The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss – Ferris challenges us to evaluate our perspective on the cost and availability of our dreams.  And he teaches us that hard work isn’t very hard when you love what you’re doing.  Although there’s certainly some pages of self promotion within, Ferris provides invaluable tips to help us remain aligned with our goals, set expectations on our terms, and eliminate unnecessary time-sinks while increasing our overall effectiveness.Personal Development for Smart People by Steve Pavlina – A surprisingly well-written, broad, and totally raw look at the different aspects of self-improvement.  Pavlina skillfully unveils the truth about what it takes to consciously grow as a human being by teaching what he calls ‘the seven universal principles’ behind all successful personal growth efforts.The Now Habit by Neil Fiore – Quite possibly the best book ever written on overcoming procrastination.  Fiore provides an optimistic, empathetic, and factual explanation of why we procrastinate and then delivers practical, immediately applicable tips for reversing the procrastination spell.  On many levels, this book saved my life.Ignore Everybody by Hugh MacLeod – Where does inspiration and creativity come from?  This little book attempts to uncover this mystery.  MacLeod states that creativity is not a genetic trait, nor is it reserved for professionals.  Everyone is creative sooner or later, but unfortunately, most people have it drilled out of them when they’re young.  MacLeod’s primary goal is to un-drill it and unleash your creative mind.Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazzi – Ferrazzi explains the guiding principles he has mastered over a lifetime of personal and professional networking and describes what it takes to build the kind of lasting, mutually beneficial relationships that lead to professional and personal success.  Most of this book is fantastic – you learn how to relate to people, how to establish contacts and maintain connections, and how to create a social network.  If you interact with a lot of people on a regular basis, it’s a great read.Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind by Shunryu Suzuki – This inspiring work ranks with the great Zen classics, in a voice and language completely adapted to modern-day sensibilities.  Suzuki’s words breathe with the joy and simplicity that make a liberated life possible.  As he reveals the actual practice of Zen as a discipline for daily life, the reader begins to understand what Zen is truly about.  If you’re even slightly curious about the practice of Zen Buddhism, you’ll find this book to be extremely enlightening.Eating Well For Optimum Health by Andrew Weil – If you only read one health and nutrition book in your whole lifetime, read this one.  Weil sheds light on the often confusing and conflicting ideas circulating about good nutrition, addressing specific health issues and offering nutritional guidance to help heal and prevent major illnesses.  Of particular value is his examination of recent dieting fads, such as low-carbohydrate, vegan and ‘Asian’ diets, with an eye toward debunking the myths about them while highlighting their benefits.The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell – Gladwell looks at how small ideas can spread like viruses, sparking global sociological changes.  The ‘tipping point’ is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire.  Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend, the popularity of a new product, or a drop in the crime rate.A People’s History of the United States by Howard Zinn – Although this book is likely to be more interesting to Americans than citizens of other countries, it’s truly a great read either way.  Covering Christopher Columbus’s arrival through President Clinton’s years in office, as well as the 2000 election and the War on Terrorism, the book features an insightful and frank analysis of the most important events in American history told from the perspective of minorities and the working class.I Will Teach You To Be Rich by Ramit Sethi – This is the ultimate personal finance book for twenty-somethings (and anyone else in need of a financial planning makeover).  It’s one thing to know about finance, another to be able to write about it, and another entirely to write about it in a way that aptly motivates the younger generation.  Ramit hits the tri-fecta here.  He tells you exactly what to do with your money and why.Career Renegade by Jonathan Fields – This book is simply about building a great living around what you love to do most.  And it’s one of the best guides I’ve ever read on the subject.  Fields, a big-time lawyer turned serial entrepreneur, shows you how to turn

Adventure|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/life-of-high-adventure.jpg?resize=464%2C309&ssl=1|This guest post was written by Robin Krieglstein, founder of GoalTribe.I know a little something about living an adventurous life.  I’ve hot air ballooned Kathmandu, glacier trekked Patagonia, gone paragliding in the Andes, slept in a snow-shelter at the top of the Rocky Mountains, scuba-dived in the tropics, camel trekked the Sahara, rock-climbed in Thailand and been on an African safari.  Oh, and I’ve been sky diving, cliff diving, rafting on Class V white water, and I was even swept over a waterfall once.Huff, huff…  You thought I was finished, didn’t you?  😉I’ve also visited 20% of the world’s countries and circled the globe twice.  I’ve explored ancient castles, palaces, temples, tombs, catacombs and labyrinths.  I’ve stayed in 5 star hotels, caves and dessert caravan tents.  I’ve seen the pyramids, Machu Picchu, the Amazon, the African savanna, the Himalayas, the Eiffel Tower, the Acropolis in Athens and the Taj Mahal.And I have to tell you – it’s been extraordinary.  It’s an absolutely amazing, brilliant, beautiful world out there filled with dazzling wonders that are readily available for you to experience.  You don’t have to be rich.  You don’t have to be exceptional.  If you want to experience it all, you just have to make a decision, set some goals, and make it happen.Here’s how:Step 1:  Discover Your Vista’s of AdventureFirst get a clear vision of what the word ‘adventure’ means to you.  Take 30 minutes, put on some inspiring music, get excited and write down everything that comes to mind when you think about an adventure.  What movies inspire you?  Indiana Jones?  James Bond?  The Bourne Series?  What types of adventures appeal to you?  Adventurous sports?  Travel?  The great outdoors?  What specific activities sound like a heart-pounding blast?  Bungee jumping?  Exploring ancient ruins?  Heli-skiing (skiing areas you can only get to by helicopter)?Step 2:  Choose 5 Specific Adventure GoalsLife is short!  Now is the time to get real.  Now is the moment to make a commitment to experience the life adventures you want to experience before you die.  Choose 5 adventure goals from your brainstorm that you’re most excited about.  Pick one that you will do within 3 months, one that you will do by the end of the year, one within 2 years, one within 3 years and one within 5 years.  The first 3-month goal should be exciting, but reasonable, so it’s actually possible to achieve in a short time frame.  This one is very important because it will help you build momentum and faith in yourself.Also, be firm and DECIDE that you WILL give yourself the gift of an adventurous life.  Spend an additional 5 minutes writing out why this is important to you, and then write a formal commitment to yourself and hang it where you’ll see it every day.Step 3:  Learn How to Take the First StepNow take your first 3-month goal and figure out what you need to do to make it a reality.  One of the most common reasons people don’t make their life more exciting and adventurous is that they don’t know how to start.  But that’s okay – you can learn.  Search the Internet, the library, or talk to people who’ve done what you’re planning to do.  Ask questions.  Make calls.  Figure out what steps you need to take.  There are companies that arrange everything from local rock-climbing and white-water rafting trips to round-the-world, multi-month adventures.  Also, read “25 Ways to Learn How to Do Absolutely Anything” for more ideas.Step 4:  Create a Plan for Your First AdventureOnce you understand the initial steps that are required to embark on your first adventure goal, create a clear plan.  Make a detailed list of what actions you need to take and set a date for completing each action so that you’ll be off experiencing this first adventure in exactly 3 months from today.Step 5: Jump into Action ImmediatelyIf you’re like most people, you’ve probably just read the previous 4 steps without actually doing anything.  And guess what?  You’re in danger of finishing this article without ever taking action.  Here’s how to make sure that doesn’t happen:Take action immediately!  Yes, right now!  Start brainstorming your adventure goals.Pick your top 5 goals.  And then do one more step…Figure out what the logical first step is towards your first adventure goal.Additional Tips on Living an Adventurous LifeOvercoming your fears is half the fun of adventuring.  The adrenalin rush can be exhilarating!  And when it passes, and you realize you’re still standing, you feel a great sense of accomplishment.  Remember most fears are not real.  Fear could stand for: “False Experiences Appearing Real.”  Fear is also a great way to get people’s attention and motivate them to do things; so the media, politicians, companies and many other organizations spend a lot of time and money trying to make the world seem like a scary place.  It’s not.  Even for people living adventurous lives, disaster rarely strikes.  That’s why when it does strike it makes the evening news… because it’s rare.  Ultimately the secret to fear is:  Feel the fear and do it anyway.Whenever you have a choice of activities to do, pick the one that will make for a better story.Don’t have the time?  Instead of going to see an action movie, take action in your own life.  Instead of sitting in front of the TV, sit on a ski lift.  Instead of sleeping in your bed, sleep on a bus on the way to the Grand Canyon.  Instead of going out to the park, go out rock climbing.  Instead of vacationing at Disneyland, vacation in Thailand.Don’t have the money?  International travel is much cheaper than it seems.  Just give up a few luxuries and don’t try to keep living exactly the same way you do at home.  You will keep costs down and have a much more profound experience if you eat what the locals eat, sleep like the locals sleep and travel like the locals travel.  Visit countries that are more affordable than your home country.  As for adventure sports, most of them are filled with specialized, expensive gear that you don’t need.  You need SOME to be safe, but don’t be fooled into a thousand dollar shopping spree for a weekend camping trip.  Rent, borrow or go without.  Yes you can!For additional advice on doing the impossible, I recommend reading (or rereading) Marc and Angel’s excellent post “How to Walk on Water.”And one last tip from someone who’s been there:  As your life unfolds with new excitement, experiences and adventure, you must, must, must keep a journal of your experiences.  Also, take thousands of pictures and lock those precious moments into your memory forever.  Someday, when you’re sitting with your children or grandchildren, you’ll be so happy you did.What adventures would you like to conquer?  Please share your thoughts in the comments section below.Robin Krieglstein is the Founder and CEO of GoalTribe,

Memorable|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/today-memorable.jpg?resize=464%2C288&ssl=1|Nobody can go back and start a new beginning,but anyone can start today and make a new ending.– Maria RobinsonYesterday is gone and tomorrow is just a figment of the imagination.  So if you think about it, today is the only day you’re alive.  Today is the day that matters the most.Here’s how to make it memorable:Try something totally new. – Variety truly is the spice of life.  You can see or do something a million times, but you can only see or do it for the first time once.  As a result, first time experiences usually leave a reflective mark in our minds for the rest of our lives.  So spice it up!Entertain yourself with real-world experiences. – Great memories are the product of interesting life experiences.  So turn off the television (or the computer) and get outdoors.  Interact with the world, appreciate nature, take notice of the simple pleasures life has to offer, and just watch as life unfolds in front of you.Work on something that’s meaningful to you. – Engage yourself in a meaningful personal project.  Or pull the trigger on doing something you’ve wanted to do for a long time, but haven’t yet had the resolve to do.  Life is short.  Today is the day to take action.Challenge your mind and body. – Learn a new skill.  Be creative.  Build something from the ground up, no matter how small.  Run farther than you’ve ever run before.  Push yourself to the limits!Concentrate on less, but give it your best. – Slow down.  Pay close attention to what you’re doing.  Don’t waste time juggling forgettable tasks.  Instead, concentrate on a few things that really matter.  Engage fully in this day.Say “yes” to a spontaneous opportunity. – Everything in life can’t be planned.  Some of the greatest opportunities will knock on your door when you least expect them to.  Be flexible, be spontaneous, and just say “yes.”Complete an important piece of unfinished business. – Today is a perfect day to finish what you started.  Few feelings are more satisfying than the one you get after an old burden has been lifted off of your shoulders.Document your day. – Take lots of pictures.  Keep a journal.  Document your day so you can review it some other day.  Many moons from now, these old photos and journal entries will ignite your recollection of great memories from the past.Smile, be positive, and notice what’s right. – Everything that happens in life is neither good nor bad.  It just depends on your perspective.  And no matter how it turns out, it always ends up just the way it should.  Either you succeed or you learn something.  So stay positive, appreciate the pleasant outcomes, and learn from the rest.Be authentic.  Be true to yourself. – Judy Garland once said, “Always be a first rate version of yourself, instead of a second rate version of somebody else.”  Live by this statement.  There is no such thing as living a good day in someone else’s shoes.  The only shoes you can occupy are your own.  If you aren’t being yourself, you aren’t truly living… you’re merely existing.  And no day spent in a phony state of mere existence will ever be memorable or worthwhile.Actively assist someone in need. – In life, you get what you put in.  When you make a positive impact in someone else’s life, you also make a positive impact in your own life.  Do something that’s greater than you, something that helps someone else to be happy or to suffer less.  I promise, it will be an extremely rewarding experience.  One you’ll likely remember forever.Share time with a good friend and experience life together. – Pink Floyd once said, “The memories of a man in his old age are the deeds of a man in his prime.”  There are few things more satisfying than recounting the greatest moments of your life with your closest friends who lived these moments alongside you.Make a new friend. – People are interesting creatures, and no two people are exactly alike.  So meet someone new today.  Find out what makes them tick.  They’ll likely open your eyes to fascinating ideas and perspectives.  And you never know, they just might change your life.Do something fun and laugh your ass off. – Some of the most memorable moments in your life will be moments spent in laughter.Be present.  Be here now. – I purposely left this bullet for last because it perfectly encompasses all of my previous points. – Don’t let your life slip by.  Instead of dwelling on the past, or worrying about the future, just practice being and living in the ‘now.’  Remember, right now is the only moment guaranteed to you.  Right now is life.  Don’t miss it.And I leave you with this to think about:We all agree that life is short.  Sooo…Why do we do so many things we don’t like and like so many things we don’t do?Photo by: FMC.Nikon.D40 How Love Begins|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/how-love-begins.jpg?resize=464%2C304&ssl=1|This post has moved to

Place|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/win-in-last-place.jpg?resize=464%2C309&ssl=1| This guest post was written by Alex Fayle, author of Someday Syndrome.When I was seven years old, I won a foot race in last place.An OutsiderDue to foul play at other schools, the local school district enacts a mandatory policy during recess hours that segregates the schoolyard based on gender.  Boys and girls are no longer allowed to partake in activities together.  Given that my friends are almost all girls, I feel lost.  I’m not rough and tough enough to feel comfortable with the boys, and yet my gender excludes me from hanging with my friends, the girls.So I learn to be an outsider.  I have a couple acquaintances in both camps, but I’m not actively a part of either, at least not anymore.  And because I’m an outsider, I quickly become the object of teasing.  Every tribe picks a walking, talking target of ridicule and I fall easily into this role.With OneselfAlthough the words hurt, I find strength from within to push forward, to stay who I am.  Because my parents instilled love and patience in my mind from the time I was born.  They taught me that the only valid competition is with oneself.  So I don’t mind being me.  I just wish everyone else would learn to accept me as I am.To add to my exclusion, I’m fairly clumsy and athletically awkward.  I can’t pull my limbs together in a coordinated manner to lift myself over the high-jump bar, to propel my body through the air for the triple-jump, or to pump my legs fast enough along the race track.I’m never in last place, but because of my outsider status, the majority of the students spew words of ridicule at me anyways.  The other outsiders – the poor, malnourished students who wear tattered clothes to school, or the ones with physical disabilities – they get verbally harassed too.  And although they never say a word about it, I can see the pain and frustration in their eyes.  It hurts them just as much, if not more, than it hurts me.The First TimeAs the teachers group the boys together for the weekly 100 yard dash, I decide it’s time for an outsider to win for once.In the eyes of my classmates, I’m already the loser.  Regardless of whether I come in first place or last, they will mock me.  I realize I have nothing to lose and everything to gain.  So I purposely run slow and let everyone pass me, even the poor boy whose ribs show through his skin, whose track and field clothes are the same as his day-to-day clothes… the one whose always in last place.From my position just behind him, I see the teachers cheering him on.  Then suddenly, and surprisingly, some of the students join in.  I make an effort to seem like I’m pushing myself while actually falling back more and more.  And before long, all the students are cheering him on.  “You got it!” they chant.  “You’re almost there!”The boy crosses the finish line and looks back at me.  He has a smile on his face stretching from one end of the schoolyard to the other.  It’s the first time he’s not in last place.I pant across the finish line and receive the usual jeers, but I smile too.  Because today I learned how to win in a way many of my classmates will never understand.I may have finished in last place.But I won the race.Alex Fayle, of Someday Syndrome, is a former procrastinator who uses his visionary ability to uncover

"20 Life Lessons I Learned in My 20’s|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/20-life-lessons.jpg?resize=464%2C281&ssl=1|With an impending 28th birthday on my mind, I spent some quiet time this evening reflecting on my recent past.  And I’ve come to realize that my 20’s taught me a lot about life.  So, I figured I’d share a few lessons I’ve learned along the way.If you’re smiling right now, you’re doing something right.It’s not so much what you say that counts, it’ how you make people feel.The biggest mistake you can make is doing nothing because you’re scared to make a mistake.No matter how it turns out, it always ends up just the way it should be.  Either you succeed or you learn something.  Win-Win.Freedom is the greatest gift.  Self-sufficiency is the greatest freedom.If you catch yourself working hard and loving every minute of it, don’t stop.  You’re on to something big.  Because hard work ain’t hard when you concentrate on your passions.It’s not about getting a chance, it’s about taking a chance.  You’ll rarely be 100% sure it will work.  But you can always be 100% sure doing nothing won’t work.  Sometimes you just have to go for it!Complaining is like slapping yourself for slapping yourself.  It doesn’t solve the problem, it just hurts you more.The one with nothing to hide is always the one left standing tall.You can press forward long after you can’t.  It’s just a matter of wanting it bad enough.There’s a big difference between knowing and doing.  Knowledge is basically useless without action.In work and business, when they need you more than you need them, you have succeeded.Everything that happens in life is neither good nor bad.  It just depends on your perspective.We are all weird.  And life is weird.  And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we call it love.True friendship and true love do sustain the tests of distance and time.You can’t change who you are.  You can only change what you know and how you apply this knowledge.It is okay to be angry.  It is never okay to be cruel.Even when you feel like you have nothing, someone else likely has far less.  Find them and help them.  You’ll see why.Having a thousand credentials on the wall will not make you a decent human being.  But genuinely helping one person everyday will.Remember, change happens for a reason.  Roll with it.  It won’t be easy, but it will be worth it.And I leave you with this question:How old would you be if you didn’t know how old you are?Photo by: Nattu The Art of Being Naked|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/art-of-being-naked.jpg?resize=464%2C320&ssl=1|The GirlShe has dirty blond hair, a seductive smile, and the most engaging set of hazel green eyes I’ve ever seen.  It’s the kind of engaging I can’t ignore… the kind that makes me want to engage too.  Because she’s mysterious.  And I’m curious.  And I need to know more.Yet, I do my best to avoid making eye contact.  So I stare down at the pool table and pretend to study my opponent’s next move.  But only long enough for her to look the other way, so I can once again catch a glimpse of magnificence.I do this, not because she intimidates me, but because I think she may be the girl Chad met last night.  A wild night that, he said, “involved two bottles of port wine, chocolate cake, and sweaty bed sheets.”Then, just as her eyes unexpectedly meet mine, my opponent groans, “It’s been your turn for like five minutes.  Ya planning on going sometime today?”  And she walks gracefully away.So I continue to wonder… “Is she the port wine and chocolate cake girl?  Gosh, she doesn’t look like that kind of girl.”  But I don’t wonder too long because Chad enters the room and says, “Marc, there’s someone I want you to meet.”  So I follow him into the kitchen and we bump right into her.  “Oh, Angel,” Chad says.  “This is my buddy, Marc.”And I smile ear to ear and chuckle…Because she’s not the port wine and chocolate cake girl.  But also because I spent the last twenty minutes thinking about the port wine, and the chocolate cake, and the sweaty bed sheets.The DanceHours later, the party begins winding down.  But the band is still playing, the two painters who have been painting a wall mural all evening are still painting, and Angel and I are still dancing.“Are you tired?” I ask.“No,” Angel says.  “Dancing is my outlet.  When I dance, I transcend myself and the doubts that sometimes prevent me from being me.  This evening has been enchanting, just dancing with you and being me.”So I twirl her around.  And the drummer keeps drumming.  The guitarist keeps strumming.  The singer keeps singing.  The painters keep painting.  And now we’re the only ones dancing.As we continue to dance, she says, “I feel as if we’re naked.  And not just you and me, but the drummer, the guitarist, the singer, and the painters too.  Everyone left in this room is naked… naked and free.”I smile and tell her that I agree.  “We are naked.  We are free.”As I know we don’t have to take our clothes off to be naked.  Because moments of passion flow into each other like port wine flows into chocolate cake.  And if we let them, these moments can expose us completely, and continuously.  And create climaxes that don’t even require sex.Because a true climax has little to do with orgasm, and everything to do with passion, love, and devotion.  In the same way, nakedness has little to do with how much clothing one wears, and everything to do with one’s awareness in a given moment of time…  An unfettered awareness that frees their mind and allows them to truly live the moment for all it’s worth.The ClimaxAfter a few more songs, Angel asks if I’d like to join her out on the front porch where it’s quieter.  “Just so we can talk about life,” she says.I give her a little wink.  “I love life in this crazy world!  It is crazy, isn’t it?”She smiles.  “Yeah, a world in which we can be naked with our clothes on and experience continuous climax without intercourse.”“Because instead we can achieve both with music, or paint, or dance, or any form of avid self-expression,” I add.“You got it.  Even the sincerity in this conversation is beginning to work for me,” she says as we step out the front door and into the moonlight.Photo by: Grazie How To Choose Happiness With Words|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/happiness-with-words.jpg?resize=464%2C309&ssl=1|This guest post was written by Tehseen, the author of Recharge Your Mind. Happiness is simply a state of mind.  No, I’m not implying that we can instantly heal the pain of a severe or unexpected personal tragedy just by thinking about being happy.  Rather, I am referring to our levels of happiness on routine days when things in our lives are close to normal.  In these neutral times, when we are neither ecstatic nor extremely sad, the slightest change in attitude can swing our happiness balance drastically in either a positive or negative direction. One of the primary factors that affect our attitude is our choice of words.Words have a lot of power and influence on both the speaker and the listener.  When we speak we sometimes unintentionally choose words that have a negative undertone.  This can make us seem unhappy (and negative) in the eyes of others.  Even worse, after we have spoken these words our unconscious mind starts believing in them.  “If this is what came out of my mouth, it must be the way I truly feel.”However, this is not always true.  The first fleeting words that come to mind are not necessarily the most accurate representation of our feelings and intentions.  We must realize that we have the power to choose the words we use, and if we pick them carefully, they can change the way we feel.Here are three typical scenarios where positive language can inject positivity and happiness into our lives.Inject Happiness into Casual CommunicationTypically, when I ask someone “How are you?” they reply, “I’m fine” or “I’m okay.”  But one lazy Monday afternoon last month a new colleague of mine replied, “Oh, I am fabulous!”  It made me smile, so I asked him what was making him feel so fabulous and he said, “I’m healthy, my family is healthy, and we live in a free country.  So I don’t have any reason not to be happy.”  The difference was simply his attitude and his choice of words.  He wasn’t necessarily any better off than anyone else, but he seemed twenty times happier.It really struck a chord with me.  Suddenly I realized that I have a choice.  I can either say “the glass is half empty” or “the glass is half full.”  Why not rejoice in the fact that, thankfully, I don’t have anything to be terribly upset about.So now when someone asks me how I am doing, I say “I’m doing wonderful!” or “Everything is awesome!” or something similar that reflects a positive, happy mood.  Since I’ve made a regular habit of doing this, multiple friends and acquaintances have noticed a positive change in my attitude.  And I do genuinely feel happier.  Also, it seems like the people around me are smiling more now too.  So I guess it’s contagious.Keep Friendly Discussions FriendlyWe’ve all been involved in friendly discussions that turn into heated arguments.  This usually results in a complete breakdown of productive communication.  The reason for this is simple.  When people get into heated arguments they get unhappy, and unhappy people are not productive.  More often than not these arguments transpire due to our choice of words rather than our point of views. If communicated peacefully and appropriately people usually tolerate each other’s perspectives pretty well.  Hence, it’s very important to choose our words wisely even when we strongly disagree with someone.Instead of telling the other person “You always…” try saying “Sometimes you…”.Instead of saying “That’s not true,” try saying “I don’t think I completely understand your point of view.”Instead of telling your friend “I don’t want to go to that bar,” you can say “Oh, we can go to that bar too if you want, but I would rather…”Using words that make the other person feel negated always creates negativity in conversations.  On the other hand, choosing words that assure the listeners that their perspectives are being respected drastically improves the chances of getting your point across without heating things up.Wendell Johnson once said:Always and never are two words you should always remember never to use.Maintain a Hopeful OutlookWhen we are talking or thinking about ourselves we are typically the least careful with our choice of words.  We assume that there are no restrictions on what to say or how to think about our own person.  In some situations this might be true, but the positivity or negativity of our words and thoughts still affect us.For example, there is a huge difference between saying “I wish I have a house that big someday” versus “It would be great to have a house that big someday.”  The latter gives a greater sense of possibility and confidence which allows us to believe that ‘yes’ it is possible and ‘yes’ it could happen one day.  Whereas, using words like ‘I wish’ makes it seem unreachable and impossible, which generally leads to feelings of discontentment.ConclusionThese are just some simple examples that illustrate how important it is to choose and use positive words.  Remember, our words transparently coincide with our mindset.  Positive language creates a healthy balance between our mind and our heart.Tehseen Baweja writes about

way.Leave It There For Now“Go deep!” Roger shouts.  I sprint as fast as I can, but not fast enough.  The football flies over my head, bounces off the ground, and takes a massive leap over the schoolyard’s fence.  It lands in private property on the opposite side.“Ahh… jeez!” I yelp.  “That’s the witch lady’s yard!  You’re going to go get that!”“No I’m not!” Roger insists.  “I had to deal with that freak last week.  So this time it’s your turn.”“Man, she creeps me out!  The way she speaks… and that hairy mole on her nose… yuck.  I don’t feel like dealing with her.  It’s my football, and I’d rather just leave it there for now and get it later.”“Fair enough, I’m ready to do something else anyway,” Roger replies.  “Let’s head over to the arcade.  I wouldn’t mind whooping your butt in a few rounds of Street Fighter.”“Hah, you wish!  I’ll destroy you, but not today.  I promised my mom I wouldn’t leave the schoolyard.”Roger rolls his eyes.  “Dude, you’re such a goody-goody.  The arcade is practically across the street.  We’ll be back here long before your mom comes looking for us.”I think for a second.  “Well… alright, screw it.  Let’s go.”We jump on our bikes and peddle off to the arcade.It’s Too LateThirty minutes later, Roger is begging for mercy.  “Ah, today is just your lucky day,” he gripes.  “Don’t let it get to your head.”I chuckle.  “Yeah, yeah… I didn’t say a word.  But we do need to get back to the schoolyard so I can get my football.”We jump back on our bikes, peddle to the crosswalk, and wait for the ‘walk’ signal.  “Okay, ‘walk,’ we’re good!  Last one to the witch’s house is a rotten egg!” Roger shouts.  I have about a six foot head start on him, so I begin peddling as fast as I can.“No Marc!  Watch out!” Roger squeals in a panic.  I look up just in time to see a black car speeding directly at me through the red light.  I leap from my bike.  But it’s too late.My lanky fifteen year old body smashes into the windshield, flips lifelessly over the roof of the car, and strikes the concrete with a sickening thud.Barely conscious, bloody, and broken.I vaguely hear Roger’s voice crying for help over the sound of screeching tires… as the black car speeds away from the scene of the accident.He’s Our Guardian AngelI open my eyes slowly and my vision gradually comes into focus.  “Hey honey,” my mom says.“Where am I?”“You’re in the hospital, dear.  But the surgeon said you’re going to be just fine.”“Surgery?”“It’s okay, you’ve already been through surgery in the ER,” my mom replies as she grasps my hand.  “You cracked four of your ribs, which punctured your lungs.  But they went in and stitched you back together.”“That…  That…”  My mom interrupts me as tears begin rolling down her cheeks.“We just need to be grateful… because you were barely breathing, honey.  The surgeon said your lungs were filled with blood.  He said it could have been a lot worse had the ambulance not gotten to you in time.”“That car… that black car… it ran the red light,” I whisper restlessly.“Shhh… It’s okay,” my mom reassures me.  “The same wonderful man that called the ambulance also called the police with the license plate number of the black car.  The driver was drunk.  It was a hit and run.  But the police already have him in custody.”“Do you know who made the calls?”My mom reaches into her jeans pocket, pulls out a post-it note, and holds it up so I can read it.  “Chris Evans – 305-555-8362” is written in red ink.  “Chris Evans,” my mom says as she takes a deep breath.  “Whoever he is, he’s our guardian angel.”“How’d you get his name and number?”“I asked the paramedics for it.  They told me they weren’t supposed to give out this kind of information, but I begged,” my mom says.  “I told them I needed to know who saved my baby’s life.”“Have you called him?”“Yeah, but he doesn’t answer my calls.  It rings four times and goes straight to a voicemail beep.  There’s not even a voice greeting.  I’ve already left three messages over the last forty-eight hours.  But he hasn’t called me back, and I suspect he may never.”How Do You Know?Six months later, after a grueling recovery process, my doctor finally gives me the nod to partake in regular physical activity again.  Roger and I jump at the chance to toss his new Nerf football around at the schoolyard.“Go deep!” Roger shouts.“Not yet, dude.  I’m still not 100%.  My doctor says I need to ease into it slowly.  Cool?”Roger smiles.  “Yeah, of course, bro.  My bad, I didn’t mean to…”  He is suddenly interrupted.“Marc!  Marc Andrew something!” a raspy female voice hollers from behind us.  Roger and I turn around and are shocked to see the witch lady peeking her head over the schoolyard’s fence.  “I believe this belongs to you.”  She holds up an old football and tosses it towards me.  The ball bounces across the ground and rolls up to my feet.  Sure enough, it’s the ball I left on her property the day of the accident.“Thanks, but… how… how do you know my name?  And my middle name?” I ask.“About six months ago, your mom left me a few voicemail messages.  My name is Chris Evans,” she says.Photo by: Yuga 5 Practical Steps for Generating New Ideas and Insights|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/ideas-and-insights.jpg?resize=464%2C352&ssl=1|This guest post was written by Glen Allsopp, the author of PluginID.About a year ago, I feared I would struggle to build an audience for my new personal development website.  My fear was solely based on the fact that I had just turned 19.  I simply assumed most people would question my age, and thus, my advice.  After all, I haven’t lived as long as many of you who are reading this right now.I did, however, manage to break my own limiting beliefs by sharing quality information and using my fresh personal experiences to my advantage.  Just last week a friend from the speakers club I go to came up to me and said, “I love your website, but how do you do it?  Where do you get all of your insight from?  I’m 40 and I haven’t even come to some of these realizations yet.”At the time, I had to give a quick answer and it probably wasn’t the best advice.  However, now that I’ve had more time to think about it, there are certain principles I follow that have allowed me to generate loads of new ideas and insights in a relatively short timeframe.  I’ve come to realize that ideas don’t tend to just ‘come’ to me, but instead there are clear-cut actions I take to produce them.For a little boost of creativity and insight, follow these 5 steps.Think Before You SleepAlthough you may not be aware of it it, even when you’re sleeping your brain continues to process and evaluate your ideas and thoughts.  Throughout history, famous figures like Napoleon have stated that they focus on their problems just before they sleep, and tend to have an answer when they wake up.As soon as I read about this, I instantly remembered how many times I had solved an issue of mine just minutes after waking up.  The stresses of our daily routine can sometimes get in the way of our creativity, but if we focus on our thoughts, ideas, and insights minutes before bedtime, our subconscious mind will ponder it all while we rest.Don’t Let Your Beliefs Limit YouI thoroughly believe that at times we stall on executing excellent ideas and solutions simply because we think they are too obvious or too easy.  We think about it too much and convince ourselves that it’s silly or not worth it.  At other times we doubt the fact that we are even capable of coming up with good ideas nobody else has thought of yet.If you let your beliefs limit you, like I almost did by telling myself that I was too young, then these beliefs will always hold you back.  Realize that you are a unique person with the ability to create and conjure ideas that no human has had before you.Read Relevant BooksTruth be told, I’ve never been a big reader… at least not until the last year or so.  In the last 12 months I’ve probably read more books than I did during the previous 18 years of my life.  So it’s no coincidence that I’m now coming up with more practical insights than I had in the past.It’s been said that you can become very knowledgeable about something just by reading 3 quality books on the subject.  Of course, it also helps if you concentrate on reading books that pertain to subjects you have an interest in.  If you enjoy personal development, then two books I highly recommend are Psycho-Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz and The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle.Remember, humans have been around for thousands of years.  There’s lots of excellent information out there to digest.Take and Review NotesI think this is the most important habit of all.  Think of a book or great article that you read in the last year.  My guess is that you can remember some of the key points, but you’ve probably also completely forgotten numerous pages of useful information.  Whenever I read a quality book, I either take notes at the time or go back through it and highlight my favorite points.  I then review these points regularly until I have them ingrained in my mind.This doesn’t apply to reading only.  You’ll probably find that some of your best ideas come when you are doing something completely unrelated to the idea itself.  In such cases, it’s wise to carry a small notebook or smart phone around with you so you can record your ideas on the go.My Google Docs account is literally flooded with high quality notes from a number of my favorite authors and my own personal experiences.  I tend to look through these notes when I need inspiration or just to refresh my memory.Maintain an Open Mind to New InformationIf you adopt the position that you know everything about a subject then you’ll obviously never come up with any new insights about it.  Additionally, if you are too shortsighted to see that some of your current beliefs may be mistaken, then you are completely inhibiting your peronal growth potential.Instead, be open-minded and realize that there will always be more for you to learn.  Of course, you don’t have to accept every new piece of information that comes your way, but at least evaluate it properly before discarding it.ConclusionI believe everyone, regardless of age or background, can come up with new ideas and excellent insights.  You just need to know how to harness them.Glen Allsopp writes for a blog called PluginID on the subject of personal development.  He also teaches people how they can be who they want to be through personality development.Photo by:

"How To Be The Best You Can Be|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/best-you-can-be.jpg?resize=464%2C310&ssl=1| This guest post was written by Celestine, author of Personal Excellence. Do you expect nothing but the best from yourself?  Well, you are not alone.  As someone who’s highly committed to personal excellence and growth, my motto in life is to ‘be my best self and live my best life.’  I strive to uphold this motto every single day.  In doing so, I have adopted ten simple principles which help me stay on track:Follow Your HeartFollow your passion.  Life’s too short to spend it doing something you don’t love.  When I made the decision to leave my brand management career last year, I faced varying levels of resistance from people all around me – my parents, friends, managers, colleagues, mentors, etc.  Some thought I went crazy.  Some thought I was undergoing a strange life-phase.  Some thought it was a waste to give up a Fortune 100 career with excellent prospects and a sizable paycheck.  And others thought I was just being rash and wasn’t thinking things through.If what you are doing now is not your passion,then you have nothing to lose.The truth is, it was a decision two years in the making.  I had already discovered my passion before I graduated from college.  After two years of working, I had reached the point where every day I spent at my job was making me unhappy.  And I knew I could be doing something I really loved instead.  So I quit my job to pursue my passion, and I haven’t looked back since.Today, I’m happier than I’ve ever been, pursuing my passion in full throttle – touching lives through my personal development blog, coaching people and speaking at related events.  The story doesn’t end here either – I have huge plans in the future to transform even more lives and I can’t wait to make this a reality.  Now that I’m in full control of me, there are no limits at all to what can be done!So what’s your passion?  What are your goals and dreams?  If you absolutely knew you couldn’t fail, what would you do with your life?  To aid your goal achievement process, check out my seven-part goal achievement series.Prioritize and FocusOne of my core values is excellence, and I believe a key component of excellence is focus.  I ensure that everything I do has a single-minded focus – it starts off first with my purpose in life, laddering down to my life goals, then my long-term goals, my short-term goals, and finally down to my daily tasks.  One of the tools which helps keep me focused is my life handbook.  It’s a life manual I created back in 2007 that contains my purpose, vision, goals, strategies, and specific plans to keep me on track.  It has served me tremendously over the years.I’m also a strong advocate of the 80-20 rule – where 20% of the causes lead to 80% of the effects.  Many outcomes in life are attributable to a few small actions, and once we get all those key actions right, we will gain phenomenal results.  Thus, I’m always looking out for the most critical factors that require my attention.  Once I identify them, I put forth my best effort to conquer them.  As for the remaining factors, I either do them with lesser attention, delegate them out to others, or outsource the work.  So in summary, I make sure that the things I spend my time doing are the things that have the most impact.Look on the Positive SideProbably cliché, but true nonetheless, you must stay positive.  You can look at a half-filled glass from multiple perspectives.  If you are positive, you will cheer at how the glass is half-full.  If you are negative, you will sigh and resign at the half-empty portion of the glass.  If you are a realist, you will simply see the glass as a glass.At the end of the day, what you are faced with is simply the way it is.  Everything else is your own perspective.  Focus on the negative side of the situation, and you will be mired in negativity.  Focus on the positive upside, and you will gain a positive outlook which will improve your experience and quality of life, giving you the momentum to move onward and upward.Place Yourself in the Face of UncertaintyUncertainty is my compass towards growth.  Whenever I’m faced with something that makes me feel uncomfortable or uncertain, it’s an indicator that there are growth opportunities inside me.  In fact, the more uncertain I feel, the more it signifies the possibility for growth.If I feel uncertain about a particular topic I’m writing about, it means I need to learn more about this topic before I continue writing.  If I feel uncertain about a circumstance, it means I need to learn how to deal with it.  It has become a natural reaction for me to explore feelings of uncertainty inside of me as they arise, work on them, and then emerge with an increased level of self-awareness.Are you putting yourself in the face of uncertainty?  Or are you snuggled away in your comfort zone?  Personal growth only occurs when you are faced with an unprecedented situation that forces you to expand your comfort boundaries.Think and ReflectIntrospection is pretty much my staple hobby.  If there’s anything I’m grateful for, it’s the ability to think freely.  Being able to think and reflect on our lives is a gift. Whenever you reflect on your own thoughts and actions, you gain a greater sense of clarity about yourself and the world around you.Think about the things that make you happy and the things that make you sad.  Why do these things make you feel the way they do?  Think carefully when you answer these questions, and get comfortable with your answers.Of course, this doesn’t mean you should be thinking 24/7.  Sometimes, detaching yourself from the reality and becoming an observer (through meditation, another one of my favorite hobbies) is needed as well.Detach YourselfThere is nothing permanent in this world.  Money, material possessions, success, circumstances, and people – each of these enter and leave our lives continuously.  Thus, there is no reason to attach yourself to whatever you see.  This includes the outcome of different situations.If there is something happy in your life, relish in it, enjoy it, but don’t develop an unhealthy craving towards it.  If there is something unhappy in your life, experience the emotion and smile at it at the same time, knowing that nothing is permanent and that this situation will dissipate in time.Many of life’s disappointments and miseries come from attaching yourself to particular outcomes.  When you realize that nothing is permanent and all that you see will be gone soon, then feelings of unhappiness and fear tend to dissipate.Concentrate on Actionable StepsDon’t waste your time on things that you cannot change.  I generally classify things you cannot change into 2 categories – (1) The past (2) Other people.  This means that you should focus on effecting the present, so you can shape the future and progress your wellbeing.Harping on things that cannot be changed is just a waste of your time and energy.  If something happened in the past that upset you, focus on what can be done to alleviate the situation in the future.  If people are annoying you, focus on what you can act on to remove the annoyance.There was a time at my previous job where I faced a difficult series of challenges.  I became somewhat jaded and fell into a self-victimizing mode.  After a short period of doing this, I just felt sick of it – the negativity, the inaction, everything.  That’s when I realized that no matter what the circumstances are, or how tough they may appear, there are always actionable steps I can take to change the situation.For whatever challenge you may be facing in life now, think in terms of actionable steps.  What can you do in this situation?  How can you act to move yourself closer to where you want to be?  Check Marc’s excellent post 28 Ways to Slay the Delay to learn more about taking action.Keep the Momentum AliveMost people often spend copious amount of time thinking about things and planning things, but then defer the action stage perpetually.  They justify themselves into inaction, citing reasons such as wanting to avoid failure.  It’s a total cop-out.  Here’s another favorite quote of mine:Even if you’re on the right track, you’ll get run over if you just sit there.-Will Rogers.It is by taking action and receiving feedback from this action that we expand our horizons.  By constantly acting and moving, you are automatically gaining more knowledge just by virtue of the response you are receiving from your interactions with the world around you.  Remember, information won’t walk up to you on its own.  You have to go get it.Learn From the BestMany of the things you want to know have already been experienced firsthand by others.  I have found that I can achieve so much more by studying what others have already done.  Then I can build upon the knowledge I gain from them.  In the process, I keep the best practices and remove everything else.This doesn’t mean that you stop experiencing new things for yourself.  It just means you aren’t reinventing the wheel a hundred times over.  It’s a simple way to avoid making the mistakes others have already made.  This cuts down the learning curve by a whole lot and gives you much better results in a much shorter timeframe.In summary:Surround yourself with great people.  As Jim Rohn puts it, you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.Study the best practices of the people who are succeeding in subjects you would like to pursue.Help OthersI used to be quite a selfish person, keeping everything, including my knowledge, for myself.  I had heard many talk about the benefits that come from contribution and giving, but I could never comprehend them until I gave it a try.  In the past year after I left my day job, I have dedicated myself to serving others and helping others live their best life. It has been the most incredible and meaningful year of my life yet, and I just know there’s so much more to come.When you help others, you not only help them grow, but you also grow yourself.  Your generosity opens the floodgates to an abundance of love and resources that flow between everyone involved.For example, I spend many hours every day working on my personal development blog and writing free articles for others.  While I receive no direct monetary benefit for what I write, the universe pays me back indirectly – in terms of media coverage from journalists who heard about my blog and my story, speaking engagements by organizations which heard about me through word of mouth, coaching sign-ups from people who want to enlist my help in achieving their dreams, love from readers who have benefited from my writings, and much more.Of course, the motivation to give should come from an unadulterated desire to want to give and contribute, and not for the benefits that follow.  The joy of giving comes from giving itself; the other perks are just a bonus.ConclusionApply these ten principles into your life, and I promise you’ll start seeing positive results.  Please stay in touch and let me know how they work out for you.  😉Also, read these books for more on being your best self:Become a Better You: 7 Keys to Improving Your Life Every DayLearned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and Your LifeOptimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best SelfCelestine Chua is a personal excellence coach who writes at The Personal Excellence Blog to help others like you achieve excellence.  She has been featured frequently in the press and is a highly sought-after life coach.  Some of her top articles: 50 Ways to Boost Your Productivity and Cultivate Good Habits in 21 Days.Photo by: H. Koppdelaney I Am My Own Worst Enemy|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/myworstenemy.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1|A petite, light-skinned Jamaican woman sits with her husband in a crowded beachside ice cream shop in San Diego.  Although she doesn’t speak loudly or occupy much space in the room, people notice her.Her hair is long, flowing and black like a windy night.  Her lips are soft and red like rose petals.  Her curves are subtle, yet they dip and bend in all the right places.  Her skin is smooth, brown, maple cream.  And her clothes are modest, accentuating everything, while exposing nothing at all.She knows why they’re looking at her.  “It’s because I’m not white,” she says.  “It’s because we’re an interracial couple and they don’t understand why you’re with me.”Her husband groans and closes his eyes.  There’s nothing he can say.  They’ve already had this conversation a hundred times before.  He threads his fingers through his hair in frustration and watches as his chocolate ice cream begins to melt.Three tables over, two white college kids eat their ice cream cones and check out ‘the scene.’  As usual, they’re not impressed.  The women around here are too old, too fat, too ugly, or…, “Wow, look at her,” the pimple-faced one says as he nods his head towards the Jamaican woman.The prematurely balding one turns around to look.  “Oh yeah, she must be a model,” he replies.  “She’s way out of our league, bro…”“I don’t think I should have to explain why this is so painful for me,” the Jamaican woman continues.  “The media portrays white, blonde females as the essence of beauty and perfection.  My color is simply a genetic defect.”A chubby white girl, about ten years old, naively stares at the Jamaican woman while sipping a root beer float.  Small tears stream down her face.  “Daddy, why can’t I be as pretty as her?” she asks her father.“It doesn’t matter if you’re physically faithful to me,” the Jamaican woman says to her husband.  “Because with all these influences surrounding you, you’re probably internalizing your deep desires for a genetically endowed female companion.  And it kills me!  Don’t you understand?”“Please honey… Are you ready to go home?” her husband replies softly.  She hasn’t taken a single bite of her brownie sundae and all of the ice cream has already melted.  She sighs and stands up, weakly.Three well-dressed white women in their late twenties talk cheerfully and sip diet cokes at a table near the door.  They were all childhood friends at a local orphanage.  When they were eventually placed in different foster homes, they lost contact with each other.  This special reunion is their first time together in almost fifteen years.“Did you see those three women by the door?” the Jamaican woman asks her husband as they walk to their car.  “Wealthy white women like that don’t even appreciate how easy their life has been.”Photo by: Jasmic 32 Thought-Provoking Life Stories|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/thought-provoking-life-stories.jpg?resize=464%2C284&ssl=1|Sometimes the most random everyday encounters force us to stop and rethink the truths and perceptions we have ingrained in our minds.  These encounters are educationally priceless.  They spawn moments of deep thought and self-reflection that challenge the status quo and help us evolve as sensible individuals.On our new sister site, Makes Me Think, we call these thought-provoking life experiences ‘MMTs’.  Makes Me Think is an online community where people share daily life stories that provoke deep thought and inspire positive change.Here’s a sample of 32 MMT stories that were recently submitted to the site:Today, I was sitting on a hotel balcony watching 2 lovers in the distance walk along the beach.  From their body language, I could tell they were laughing and enjoying each other’s company.  As they got closer, I realized they were my parents.  My parents almost got divorced 8 years ago.  MMTToday, I asked my 6 year old son what he wants to be when he grows up.  He said, “Mommy, all I want to be is happy.”  MMTToday, after spending the last 3 years viciously bickering with the college kid who lives next door, I found myself crying in his arms and thanking him repeatedly for saving my son’s life.  MMTToday, my daughter confronted me with the fact that my biggest fear, a fear that has held me back from many life experiences, has never come true.  I am 76 years old.  MMTToday, I attended the grand opening for Shane’s art gallery.  Shane is a quirky, soft-spoken guy with long red hair.  For the last 5 years I’ve thought he was a bit of a weirdo.  But today I realized Shane’s weirdness is just the side-effect of being an artistic genius.  MMTToday, my company employs 130 intelligent individuals and turns a net profit of nearly $500K a year.  I started this company 10 years ago after I was laid off by IBM.  If they hadn’t laid me off, I might still be working in a cubicle at IBM today.  MMTToday, I waited on an elderly woman at the local restaurant where I work.  She left me a $90 tip on a $10 tab with a handwritten note that said, “I’m 86 and I can’t take this money with me.  So please spoil yourself with it.”  MMTToday, I tested a theory that didn’t work, which led me to different theory that didn’t work, which spawned a totally new idea that seems to work really well.  Although it doesn’t solve the original problem, all of my business partners agree that this idea has earth-shattering potential.  MMTToday, I saw a pretty scary looking guy who had a tall blue mohawk and tattoos and piercings all over his body.  He was helping my elderly neighbor take her trash down to the curb.  My neighbor told me afterwards that the guy was just walking by and offered to help.  MMTToday, I married the man of my dreams.  I left for college at 18 and looked for him there.  Nothing.  I moved to a new city and looked for him there.  Nothing.  Then last fall I returned home for Thanksgiving.  My brother’s best friend, whom I grew up with, joined us for dinner.  And I found him.  MMTToday, I was reunited with an old buddy.  Throughout college we were best friends.  Then just before graduation we got into a nasty fight over a girl.  Terrible words were exchanged and we never spoke again, until today.  And as we hugged each other, we acknowledged how irrelevant that girl is now.  MMTToday, my 21 year old son’s alternative rock band received a record deal from a major record label.  I spent the last 5 years trying to convince him that college was the smarter way to go.  But he stood his ground and pursued his dream.  And now he’s living it.  MMTToday, I was walking along the boardwalk in Pacific Beach when I saw 4 teenagers heckling a homeless beach bum.  He laughed and said, “I’m not crazy!  ‘Crazy’ is spending 40 years of your life hating 40 hours a week.”  MMTToday, I met a movie star celebrity who has been one of my idols since I was a kid.  He was a total jerk in real life.  MMTToday, a lady walked up to me in the gym and asked me to give her some workout pointers.  She said, “You look incredible!  Watching you gradually tone-up and progress in here has become my primary inspiration to get in shape.”  It made me smile because I’ve struggled with my weight since I was 15.  MMTToday, I implemented a web-based business idea I got from my girlfriend.  The kickoff was a total success.  She actually tried explaining this idea to me 2 years ago, but I was too busy at the time to listen.  MMTToday, I checked my account balance and realized I had been fined $40 by my bank for a $2 overdraft when I bought a coffee on the way to work.  “I couldn’t be any more broke!” I cried aloud as I walked outside to get some air.  Just then a skinny homeless man limped out from a nearby alleyway.  MMTToday, my daughter who struggled to get C’s in grade school owns a multi-million dollar cosmetics company.  My daughter who was in the gifted program in grade school is happily employed as a kindergarten teacher making $35K a year.  MMTToday, I ran into an old best friend I haven’t seen in nearly a year.  We live in the same city, but we’re just so busy.  MMTToday, we celebrated our 10 year anniversary.  We unknowingly held our wedding in a park on the same day a college fraternity was tailgating.  There were drunken college kids everywhere.  At the time it seemed horrific.  But it produced several amusing stories our family still laughs about today.  MMTToday, I returned 2 library books that were 3 months overdue.  The librarian looked extremely nervous as she informed me of my $34 late fee.  When I smiled and handed her the $34, she said, “Oh, thanks for being so nice about it.  Most people scream at me when I inform them of their late fees.”  MMTToday, my employer officially approved my request to work from home 2 days a week.  All of my friends and family were shocked.  “When did your employer implement this policy?” they asked.  “About 2 weeks after I pitched the idea to the CEO,” I replied.  MMTToday, I was dealt a colossal life lesson.  My girlfriend is pregnant.  I’ve worn a condom every single time we’ve had sex for the last 2 years… except for this one night last month when we were really, really drunk.  MMTToday, I visited an old neighborhood where I used to live.  The landscaping in every yard seemed better kept than I remember.  And everyone on the block seemed friendlier.  But other than the couple who moved into my old house, the same exact people live there.  MMTToday, my mother-in-law cooked fish for dinner.  I have refused to eat fish since I was a child.  But I didn’t want to seem rude, so I sucked it up and ate it anyway.  Surprisingly, I thought it was pretty good.  And I may try it again sometime soon.  MMTToday, I was at the beach watching a little girl chase her father’s remote controlled car around in circles.  She kept jumping forward and falling on her knees in an effort to catch the car as it skidded by.  She did this 31 times and failed.  But on attempt #32, she caught the car.  MMTToday, a complete stranger outside a local coffee shop was holding a sign that said, “Free Hugs.”  I hesitated at first, but then I decided to give her a hug.  Truthfully, it felt great!  MMTToday, I heard another Michael Jackson song on the radio.  For the last 15 years up until the day he died, it seemed like everyone thought he was a freak.  Now, all I hear are MJ songs on the radio and people calling him a musical genius.  It’s like the world forgot what they had until it was gone.  MMTToday, I was sitting on my front porch watching the neighbor’s kid have the time of his life with nothing more than a wooden stick and his imagination.  MMTToday, I was in a really bad mood when a young girl came into my office sporting the most genuine smile I’d seen in a long while.  She was bound to a wheelchair because she had no legs.  MMTToday, I spent an hour with a stranger, said nothing, and walked away feeling like I just had the best conversation ever.  MMTToday, I was working in a coffee shop when 2 gay men walked in holding hands.  As you might expect, heads started turning.  Then a young girl at the table next to me asked her mom why 2 men were holding hands.  Her mom replied, “Because they love each other.”  MMTMakes Me Think is

You From Yourself|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/change-your-life-30.jpg?resize=464%2C310&ssl=1|First we make our habits, then our habits make us.– Charles C. NobleIt’s not unusual for intelligent people to get themselves stuck in a deep rut in life.  By rut, I mean a somewhat extended period of time flooded with low motivation, poor moods, negative thinking patterns, and little or no productivity.  A rut like this can be extremely difficult to get out of.  I’ve been there several times, so I know that rediscovering productivity and finding the motivation to delve into anything even remotely challenging can seem nearly impossible.  However, we must eventually come to our senses and realize that there’s no point in going through life feeling unmotivated, tired, stressed out, and unhealthy.  Misery is, after all, a choice.Escaping the bounds of a deeply-grooved rut requires nothing more than some willpower, a good plan, and the resolve to take immediate action.  Most ruts are caused by a lack of self-care – for example, little to no exercise, sub-par nutrition, zero personal reflection, insufficient sleep, etc.  Significant transformation can, and will, occur in a relatively short period of time if you take action now and remain diligently focused on digging yourself out of the hole you’ve created.One month – 30 days, should provide plenty of time for you to turn your life around.  Below are some helpful tips to get you started.  Make it your goal to gradually incorporate all of these tips into your life over the course of the next month.Get Naked and Face Reality – Remove all of your clothing, weigh yourself, and then stand naked in front of a full-length mirror for 30 seconds.  Put your clothing back on and take the next two minutes to think about what you’ve just witnessed.  How do you feel?  Comfortable?  Disturbed?  Shocked?  If you felt anything other than comfortable, move on to the next step.Take Out the Trash – While holding a large garbage bag, rummage through your refrigerator and kitchen pantry and throw away anything that lists ‘high fructose corn syrup’ as an ingredient.  While you’re at it, throw away items that contain ‘partially hydrogenated’ anything.  This would include most packaged and processed foods such as cookies, chips, crackers, sodas, etc.  Reward yourself by removing a single item from the bag that was the most difficult for you to throw away.  Take one bite and throw the rest back in the garbage bag.Gather the Necessary Supplies – Now that you’re close to being out of food, grab a pencil and paper and begin making a new grocery list that includes the following items: oatmeal, eggs, chopped walnuts, fresh baby spinach, skinless chicken breasts, raw almonds, raisins, salmon fillets, whole wheat bread, canned tuna, unprocessed cheese, four vegetables of your choice, and three fruits of your choice.  Do your own research as to why I selected these foods, and find other foods to add to your grocery list for the same reasons (Hint: protein, omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, whole grains, and vitamins).Put the Bottle Down – Cut your alcohol consumption by 50 percent.  If you drink one glass of wine every night of the week, drink one glass every other night instead.  If you drink a case of beer each week, cut your consumption down to two six-packs.  If you drink one bottle of whiskey per week, buy a smaller bottle.  It’s hard to be motivated or productive when you’re constantly buzzed or hung-over.Schedule a Long-Overdue Visit – When was the last time you saw your family physician?  Call your doctor and schedule a full physical examination.  Take every piece of advice that he or she gives you as the gospel and ask at least three specific questions related to your health.  Research any prescriptions that are written for you so that you understand what you are being asked to take and why.  This time, keep your clothes on while the nurse weighs you, and stay away from full-length mirrors.  😉Stimulate Your Brain with New Insights – Buy or borrow two insightful personal development books that contain at least 150 pages each.  Here are some titles to consider:  The Power of Less, How to Win Friends and Influence People, The Power of Now.  Commit to finishing both books in 30 days by reading during your regularly scheduled television time.  By default, this will cut the time you watch television in half.  Better yet, engage in a “media fast” whereby you unplug the television and internet for an entire month.  Watch your productivity soar!Fuel the Machine First – Make time to eat breakfast every day – it really doesn’t take that long.  Place one half heaping cup of oatmeal and one cup of water in a microwave-safe bowl.  Nuke it for two minutes.  Add a dash of cinnamon, a handful of raisins, a handful of chopped walnuts, and a touch maple syrup or honey.  Eat and get energized.Re-Fuel with Premium More Often – Each day between breakfast, lunch and dinner, eat a handful of almonds and a piece of fruit.  These small nutritional snacks provide boosts of energy that will prevent you from slumping over your desk in a near-comatose state each afternoon.  The almonds provide a great source of magnesium, a necessary mineral proven to calm your nerves and reduce fatigue.Renew and Reconnect – Plan an enjoyable night out with either a friend or your significant other at least twice this month.  Refrain from talking about yourself and instead ask questions that show your appreciation and interest in the person you’re with.  Also, expand your horizons by allowing your companion to select the location and entertainment for the night.  You just might learn something new.Look Beyond Yourself – Pray or meditate once a day for at least five minutes.  If this seems to calm your mind, increase the time from five to ten minutes.Expend Some Energy – Make a valid attempt to incorporate more physical activity into your daily routine.  Spend 20 minutes, two times per week performing some type of enjoyable physical activity.  Take the stairs at the office instead of the elevator.  Take the dog for a walk.  Walk to a co-worker’s desk instead of sending him an email.  Just get up and get moving!Recharge Your Mind and Body – Get at least seven hours of quality sleep per night this month.  By following the other suggestions above, restful sleep should come naturally.  Sleep is one of the most powerful ways to rejuvenate the mind and body, increase creativity, and replenish lost energy.After 30 days have passed, take time to reflect on how you feel physically, mentally, and spiritually.  It’s likely that your rut will be replaced with a well-paved path leading to better health and a stronger sense of well-being.Remember, misery is a choice.  Your daily habits can be either a host for misery or a host for happiness and positive change.  The choice is yours to make.Photo by: Guille A Love That Is Free Will Forever Be|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/love-is-free.jpg?resize=464%2C309&ssl=1|Ten years later, they’re still together…The Girl in the MirrorShe looks at herself in the full length mirror that hangs from her bedroom wall.  Completely naked and exposed, yet confident.  She’s older than she was five years ago, but feels much younger.  And she thinks momentarily about the different men who held her in front of this mirror.They thought they possessed her.  They thought she was theirs.  Because she was in their arms, so delicate and sweet.  But really she possessed them.  Because she possesses the space in front of the mirror.  And the moments that occur there too.She gazes down at the man lying naked in her bed.  But he’s not just another man.  For the first time in years, this one sleeps differently.  With a subtle smile, a dash of poise, and a history free of envy.  And she smiles and giggles to herself.Just then, he stirs, slowly lifts his head, squints his eyes, and looks at her standing across the room, naked in front of the mirror.  His movement startles her and she jumps.  Not because he sees her naked, but because she isn’t ready for him to be awake.  Not yet.This is her time, the early morning, when the world is quiet and she can hear the sound of her own breathing.  It’s a sacred time when answers and insights aren’t as hard to come by.  A time when her mind is at peace and her heart beats slower.  And it begins beating slower again.  Because he closes his eyes and falls back asleep.She slips on her robe, tiptoes into the kitchen, pours coffee grounds and water into the coffee maker, places two slices of bread in the toaster, and opens the window curtains.  The warm, early morning sun floods into her apartment.  A few minutes later, the toaster pops.  She spreads strawberry jam on the toast, pours a cup of coffee, opens the front door, and sits down on the doorstep.And she thinks about how happy she is.  Happy to simply be.  To be free.  To not be tied down by another person or have another person tied down by her.  She stares up at the morning sky for a prolonged moment and smiles.“I’m in love,” she says aloud.The Guy in the BedHe hasn’t fallen back asleep.  When he lifts his head, squints his eyes, and sees her standing naked in front of the mirror, he senses that she isn’t yet ready for him to join her.  So he closes his eyes and pretends to sleep.He listens as she giggles, slips on her robe, tiptoes into the kitchen, and rattles the toaster, the coffee maker, and the curtains.  He loves these little noises…  Noises he calls music.Like the music of last night, when they talked and laughed for hours over a bottle of wine.  Until unexpectedly, she kissed him.  And then he kissed her back.  Because of her philosophy and her beauty.She took off his shirt.  He took off hers.  And it went on like that for what seemed like hours until they were together in bed, naked.  He thought he could love her.  He wondered if he did love her already.  And he wondered if she felt the same way.When the kitchen noises stop, he gets up, slips on his boxers, and tiptoes into the living room where he sees her sitting peacefully on the doorstep.  She’s completely bathed in the sun’s light.  As she eats toast and drinks coffee, she seems to be laughing… a sweet, silent laughter.He wants to bother her.  To tell her that he’s hungry too, and that he wouldn’t mind sharing a slice of her toast.  But he doesn’t.  Because she seems so happy and free… the way it should be.  So instead he stands in the doorway and admires her from a distance.  And he thinks about the fact that she isn’t his… that she will never be his.  And that it’s okay.Because she just said, “I’m in love.”Photo by: Jey Heich "
"When Less Advice is the Best Advice|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/less-advice-best-advice.jpg?resize=464%2C235&ssl=1|The subject of her email reads “CRISIS.”  I could tell she hastily wrote it in a state of desperation, since it’s filled with misspellings, flighty run-on sentences, and profanity.  A premise of self-doubt bleeds from every single line.  All of which caught me off-guard, because it isn’t like her to be so pessimistic.Lost at 25Like most college freshman, she wasn’t sure what she wanted to do with her life.  But during our sophomore year, she developed a love for mathematics and chose her major accordingly.  She scored so well in her undergraduate math classes that the university offered her a full scholarship to their master’s degree program.  She gladly accepted.  And just last year, while working as an assistant math professor, she decided to pursue her Ph.D.She told me she loved her work.  She actually used the phrase “life is good” last time I saw her.  I remember this because it made me smile.  But that was 4 months ago… and apparently things have changed since then.Now she says she wasted 6 years of her life.  Because she doesn’t want to be a mathematician anymore.  But she doesn’t know what she wants.  She just says she feels alone, confused, and lost at 25.I Stay SilentI meet her at a local pub.  There’s already an empty cocktail glass on the bar in front of her.  And she has dark bags under her glassy eyes.  She looks like she hasn’t slept in days.  But when she sees me, she smirks and gives me a hug.Without delay, she spills her heart, and some tears, about everything.  Emotions pour out of her for nearly 30 minutes.  And I listen.  She says she’s lonely and unhappy.  She says her and her boyfriend just broke up.  And she’s sure she ruined it, because she didn’t spend enough time with him.  Because she was busy with mathematics… teaching it, grading it, and studying for more of it.  She pleads for some advice.I tell her to slow down, to breathe, and to listen to herself and find herself.  Not the self that’s in a panic, or emotionally absorbed in a failed relationship.  But the self that loves mathematics, and her students, and is proud to be an independent woman… free to seek new directions.  She asks me how.  “How do I find that self again?  How do I reestablish my direction?”And there’s so much I want to say.  Because I want to give her real, logical advice that will enable her to find what she so desperately seeks.  But I stay silent.  And she stares into my eyes, patiently waiting and anticipating the advice I’m about to dispense.Instead, I reach for her hand and maintain my silence.  As I’ve lived long enough to know that, other than telling her to slow down and breathe, there’s no logical advice to give.  Because sometimes life defies logic, especially in delicate personal situations like the one she’s dealing with now.Uniquely OursI’ve seen young, rocky relationships develop into wonderful marriages, and fleeting inspirations ignite a lifetime of passion and happiness.  Our life stories, like the answers we give to long essay questions, are uniquely ours.  What she wants to know is already somewhere inside of her.  She just needs time to think, and be, and breathe…  And continue to explore the undirected journeys that will eventually help her find her direction.Photo by: Light Knight What Money Can’t Buy|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/what-money-cant-buy.jpg?resize=464%2C280&ssl=1|You aren’t wealthy until you have something

When Our Stories Hold Us Back|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/your-story-holding-you-back.jpg?resize=464%2C230&ssl=1|She rarely makes eye contact.  Instead, she looks down at the ground.  Because the ground is safer.  Because unlike people, it expects nothing in return.  She doesn’t have to feel ashamed.  The ground just accepts her for who she is.As she sits at the bar next to me, she stares down at her vodka tonic, and then the ground, and then her vodka tonic.  “Most people don’t get me,” she says.  “They ask me questions like, ‘What’s your problem?’ or ‘Were you beaten as a child?’  But I never respond.  Because I don’t feel like explaining myself.  And I don’t think they really care anyway.”Just then, a young man sits down at the bar on the opposite side of her.  He’s a little drunk, and says, “You’re pretty.  May I buy you a drink?”  She stays silent and looks back down at the ground.  After an awkward moment, he accepts the rejection, gets up, and walks away.“Would you prefer that I leave too?” I ask.  “No,” she says without glancing upward.  “But I could use some fresh air.  You don’t have to come, but you can if you want to.”  I follow her outside and we sit on a street curb in front of the bar.“Brrr… It’s a chilly night!”“Tell me about it,” she says while maintaining her normal downward gaze.  The warm vapor from her breath cuts through the cold air and bounces off of the ground in front of her.  “So why are you out here with me?  I mean, wouldn’t you rather be inside in the warmth, talking to normal people about normal things?”“I’m out here because I want to be.  Because I’m not normal.  And look, I can see my breath, and we’re in San Diego.  That’s not normal either.  Oh, and you’re wearing old Airwalk shoes, and so am I…  Which may have been normal in 1994, but not anymore.”She glances up at me and smirks, this time exhaling her breath upward into the moonlight.  “I see your ring.  You’re married, right?”“Yeah,” I reply.“Well, you’re off the market… and safe, I guess.  So can I tell you a story?”  I nod my head.As she speaks, her emotional gaze shifts from the ground, to my eyes, to the moonlit sky, to the ground, and back to my eyes again.  This rotation continues in a loop for the duration of her story.  And every time her eyes meet mine she holds them there for a few seconds longer than she did during the previous rotation.I don’t interject once.  I listen to every word.  And I assimilate the raw emotion present in the tone of her voice and in the depth of her eyes.When she finishes, she says, “Well now you know my story.  You think I’m a freak, don’t you?”“Place your right hand on your chest,” I tell her.  She does.  “Do you feel something?” I ask.“Yeah, I feel my heartbeat.”“Now place both of your hands on your face and move them around slowly.”  She does.  “What do you feel now?” I ask.“Well, I feel my eyes, my nose, my mouth… I feel my face.”“That’s right,” I reply.  “But unlike you, stories don’t have heartbeats, and they don’t have faces.  Because stories are not alive… they’re not people.  They’re just stories.”She stares into my eyes for a prolonged moment, smiles and says, “Just stories we live through.”“Yeah…  And stories we learn from.”Photo by: Sean McGrath How To Live Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/how-to-live-life.jpg?resize=464%2C245&ssl=1|It is not length of life, but depth of life.– Ralph Waldo EmersonBecause there is a big difference between living and merely existing…Educate yourself until the day you die. – The time and energy you invest in your education will change your life.  You are a product of what you know.  The more knowledge you acquire, the more control you have over your life.Take good care of your body. – Your body is the greatest tool you’ll ever own.  It impacts every step you take and every move you make.  Nourish it, exercise it, and rest it.Spend as much time as possible with the people you love. – Human beings are emotional creatures.  Family and close friends makeup the core of your emotional support system.  The more you nurture them, the more they will nurture you.Be a part of something you believe in. – This could be anything.  Some people take an active role in their local city council, some find refuge in religious faith, some join social clubs supporting causes they believe in, and others find passion in their careers.  In each case the psychological outcome is the same.  They engage themselves in something they strongly believe in.  This engagement brings happiness and meaning into their lives.Excel at what you do. – There’s no point in doing something if you aren’t going to do it right.  Excel at your work and excel at your hobbies.  Develop a reputation for yourself, a reputation for consistent excellence.Live below your means. – Live a comfortable life, not a wasteful one.  Do not spend to impress others.  Do not live life trying to fool yourself into thinking wealth is measured in material objects.  Manage your money wisely so your money does not manage you.  Always live well below your means.Be self-sufficient. – Freedom is the greatest gift.  Self-sufficiency is the greatest freedom.Build a comfortable, loving household. – Home is where the heart is.  Your home should be comfortable and lined with love.  It should be a place that brings the whole family together.Always be honest with yourself and others. – Living a life of honesty creates peace of mind, and peace of mind is priceless.Respect elders.  Respect minors.  Respect everyone. – There are no boundaries or classes that define a group of people that deserve to be respected.  Treat everyone with the same level of respect you would give to your grandfather and the same level of patience you would have with your baby brother.Mix it up.  Try different things. – Seek as many new life experiences as possible and be sure to share them with the people you love.  After all, your life’s story is simply a string of experiences.  The more experiences you have, the more interesting your story gets.Take full ownership of your actions. – Either you own up to your actions or your actions will ultimately own you.Over-deliver on all your promises. – Some people habitually make promises they are just barely able to fulfill.  They promise perfection and deliver mediocrity.  If you want to boost your personal value, do the exact opposite. Slightly under-sell your capabilities so that you’re always able to over-deliver.  It will seem to others like you’re habitually going above and beyond the call of duty.Listen more.  Talk less. – The more you listen and the less you talk, the more you will learn and the less you will miss.Focus more on less. – Think in terms of Karate: A black belt seems far more impressive than a brown belt.  But does a brown belt really seem any more impressive than a red belt?  Probably not to most people.  Remember that society elevates experts high onto a pedestal.  Hard work matters, but not if it’s scattered in diverse directions.  Focus on less and master it all.Exploit the resources you do have access to. – The average person is usually astonished when they see a physically handicap person show intense signs of emotional happiness.  How could someone in such a restricted physical state be so happy?  The answer rests in how they use the resources they do have.  Stevie Wonder couldn’t see, so he exploited his sense of hearing into a passion for music, and he now has 25 Grammy Awards to prove it.Savor the natural joys of simple pleasures. – I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the best things in life are free.  They come in the form of simple pleasures and they appear right in front of you at various locations and arbitrary times.  They are governed by Mother Nature and situational circumstance and captured by mindful awareness.  It’s all about taking a moment to notice the orange and pink sunset reflecting off the pond water as you hold hands with someone you love.  Noticing these moments and taking part in them regularly will bring unpredictable bursts of happiness into your life.Reflect on your goals and direction. – Not doing so is committing to wasteful misdirection.  The process of self reflection helps maintain a conscious awareness of where you’ve been and where you intend to go, giving you the ability to realign your trajectory when necessary.Leave time for spontaneous excursions. – Sometimes opportunity knocks at unexpected times.  Make sure you have enough flexibility in your schedule to respond accordingly.Be here now. – Right now is the only moment guaranteed to you.  Right now is life.  Don’t miss it.Additional Reading Material and Sources:Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes LivesThe Life You Were Born to Live: A Guide to Finding Your Life PurposeThe 4-Hour Workweek – Escape the 9-5, Live AnywherePhoto by: Shoothead That Advice Saved My Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/that-procrastination-tip.jpg?resize=464%2C249&ssl=1|Six years ago he walked into my dorm room on the verge of tears.“I can’t take it anymore!” he groaned.  “I’m just running in place!  I aim.

I leap.  I fall.  I get nowhere.  Nowhere!”His desperate eyes stared into mine, hoping… searching for an answer.His StoryHe has dreamed of pursuing a career in software engineering since he was a kid.  “Businesses worldwide will rely on my code someday,” he used to tell his computer programming teacher in high school.  Now, as a junior enrolled in computer science at a reputable university, he finally has a clear shot at making his dream a reality.He wakes up every morning filled with excitement and positive intentions.  Studying is actually the first thing that crosses his mind.  “I’ve got to get that chapter read,” he tells himself.  But first he needs to grab some Starbucks and a muffin.  “Okay, now I’m ready.”He sits down at his desk and cracks open the book Agile Software Development.  The phone rings.  It’s Jen, a good friend he met in his sophomore English class.  “Lunch today?  Yeah, I could do that.  How’s noon sound?  Perfect.  See you then.”  Before he sits back down to read, he remembers that he skipped his workout yesterday.  “A quick workout will only take forty-five minutes and it will energize my mind for a few hours of diligent studying,” he thinks to himself.  He puts his sneakers on, grabs his iPod and heads over to the campus gym.When he returns from the gym, he takes a shower and is once again ready to read.  “Chapter 1:  Welcome to the power of agile software development.  This book is divided into…”  “Ah, crap!  I forgot to email my mother those photos I promised her.  Heck, it will only take a second.”  He quickly fires-up his laptop and logs into Gmail.  Before he has time to send the email, he gets an IM from an old high school buddy, Danny, whom he hasn’t spoken to in six months.  After a forty minute chat session, he sends the email to his mother and returns to the book.He glances up at the wall clock and realizes he has to leave in thirty minutes to meet Jen for lunch.  “Gosh, it’s pointless to get into the groove of a focused study session for just thirty measly minutes,” he says aloud.  He convinces himself that it’s in his best interest to save the reading for after lunch.  So he logs into Facebook, replies to a few messages from his friends and then heads off to meet Jen.  Once he returns from lunch an hour and a half later, he feels exhausted.  The post-meal grogginess is kicking in hard.  “All I need is another round of Starbucks and I’ll be ready.”  He hustles out to grab it.As he sits down at his desk with a fresh cup of coffee he repeats the word “focus” over and over as a mantra in his mind.  He cracks the book back open.  “Chapter 1:  Welcome to the power of agile software development.  This book is divided into…”  But then his neighbor knocks on his door.  “Turn on the Local 6 news channel!  The college apartment complex down the street is on fire!” his neighbor chants.  He thinks about it for a second, puts the book down and clicks on the television.  “This should only take a second…”And another day comes closer to an end.Her StoryShe gets up early every morning, grabs her soccer ball, and heads outside before she even washes her face, or eats, or pees.  She juggles the ball between her feet nonstop until she achieves a continuous count of fifty.  An old high school coach once told her that Mia Hamm (the greatest female soccer player ever) used to do this.  When she’s done, she gears-up for the day, grabs a glass of milk and a protein bar, and heads off to soccer practice.Sometimes she catches up with me after practice, just before our 9 A.M. Economics class.  I love it when she does, because her positive attitude is contagious.   Her eyes always radiate with contentment and verve.  In the few minutes before class we usually philosophize about our lives, our ambitions, and our relationships.  For instance, today she said, “It’s all about balance.  We’ve got to somehow mesh our long-term goals with our momentary pleasures.”  She always explains herself clearly until she’s confident that I understand her point of view.Once class starts, she’s silent, entirely focused on the professor’s lecture.  Her notes are more diligent than most.  And although she rarely raises her hand, when she does, her question or comment usually brings a respectful smile to the professor’s face.Outside of class, I seldom see her during the day.  She locks herself away in her dorm room, or in the library, or on the soccer field.  She reads, writes, learns, and practices.  She conditions her mind and her body with perpetual vigor.Once or twice a week, when she actually takes a break, she’ll call me at lunchtime.  She usually goes off on a short tangent about something she’s recently learned or experienced that excites her.  And she always finishes by saying, “I’ll fill you in on the details later.”  Because she knows I’m interested in hearing them.  Because she mindfully extracts interesting details from data sources… details that most of us miss.After a little nourishment, she gets back to work.  Pages turn.  Notes are taken.  Keys on her laptop click repeatedly.  And she carries forth until her vision blurs.  When it does, she gets up, juggles her soccer ball to a count of twenty, and refocuses herself on her work.  Again she forges ahead for another couple of hours until her brain has trouble focusing and her belly aches with hunger.  Then she swings by my dorm room.It’s pretty late now, and both of us are done with whatever we’ve been working on.  So we head out for a bite to eat.  She fills me in on her day and speaks enthusiastically about the things that move her.  Sometimes it’s something new she learned.  Sometimes it’s an entrepreneurial idea.  Sometimes it’s soccer.  Or someone she met on campus.  Or a song she heard on the radio that inspires her.When we finish eating, she walks back to her dorm room.  She thinks, or reads poetry, or listens to music, or works on the novel she’s been leisurely writing for the last few months.  When her eyes finally get heavy, she snuggles into her bed and falls blissfully asleep in an instant.Satisfied with today.  Eager for tomorrow.The AdviceWhen he walked into my dorm room that day, I told him about her, and how she lives her life.And although we don’t talk as much as we used to, I received an email from him last night.  It was a cheerful email about the software company he started last year.  As it turns out, he just landed his first six-figure contract.In the P.S. section of the email, he wrote:  “Do you remember that story you told me in college about the girl who played soccer?  Thank you.  That advice saved my life.”Photo by: Kuzeytac "
"The Tools of The Mighty|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/mighty.jpg?resize=464%2C213&ssl=1|We shape our tools and afterwards our tools shape us.– Marshall McLuhanThis post has moved to HERE:The Mighty Art of Being More ResourcefulPhoto by: Shoothead Be Who You Were Born To Be|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/born-to-be.jpg?resize=464%2C211&ssl=1| It is essential to understand that battles areprimarily won in the hearts of men.– Vince LombardiVance was an incredible guitarist.  In fact, he was so good, everyone who heard him play thought he’d grow up to be a professional musician.  In his heart, he thought so too.  “Life is music.  Keep on rocking!” he tagged in my high school yearbook.  Unfortunately, his parents thought otherwise.  They wanted him to get an MBA just like his father.  Vance respected his parents.  So once in college, he put away his guitar and committed himself fulltime to his studies.  “Music isn’t an option right now,” he told me during freshman year winter recess.  “My folks are paying my tuition and I can’t afford to be on my own.”Madison dreamed of being an NCAA Women’s Soccer champion.  From the time she was a child she was swift and agile, with an obvious athletic gift.  In college, she dedicated herself to the sport.  During Madison’s freshman year, her team placed 3rd in the division.  In her sophomore year, her team placed 2nd, barely losing in the finals to a rival school.  Madison was named team captain at the start of her junior year, but immediately tore her ACL in the season opener.  She was devastated!  When she returned to the game the following season, she was no longer in championship form. “It’s not that my speed and agility isn’t there,” she admitted to me after a disappointing preseason practice. “It’s that I’m scared to go for it.  If I don’t seriously injure myself again, I may have a decent career ahead of me as a college coach.”Good Excuses are Still ExcusesVance and Madison had fairly reasonable excuses for holding back.  Vance had commitments and debts to his parents who were shelling out big bucks each year for his college tuition.  He wasn’t willing to disappoint them.  Madison was considering the idea of becoming an NCAA soccer coach someday.  She was concerned about the risk of another major injury that could potentially inhibit her coaching abilities.Yet despite these reasonable excuses for not following their hearts, they couldn’t change who they were… who they were born to be.“I knew deep down, when I wrote a business case on marketing and promoting local musicians, that music was still part of who I was.  It never stopped pulsing through my veins, and choosing to ignore this passion would have eventually ruined me,” Vance recently told me.“After my junior season came to an abrupt halt, I just couldn’t shake those late-season, freshman and sophomore losses out of my mind.  I knew I wasn’t done.  I didn’t want the injury to defeat me… I just couldn’t go out like that,” Madison told me after an NCAA sports convention last winter.The Choice is Ultimately YoursAs his parents requested, Vance majored in business administration, but also secretly minored in music at the same time.  When he graduated, a talent scout from Disney sent him an invitation to play lead jazz guitar for several ongoing shows at Walt Disney World.  He accepted the invitation and currently makes a decent living playing guitar full-time.  His whole family is proud of his success.  “In hindsight, it’s strange to think of a time when I chose not to play because I thought it would indirectly damage my career,” he said recently.  “Because the true damage… the life altering damage, would have been to quit playing for good.”Madison pulled it together and begged the coach to place her back in a starting position for her senior season.  Then she passionately attended two-a-day practices and fervent physical training sessions.  When game day finally came, every effort in every second of the game was a direct pronouncement of her love for the sport, the sport that was part of who she was.  Madison played well and the coach kept her in as a starter for the duration of the season.  Amazingly, her team made it all the way to the finals and placed 2nd in the division again.  No, she never won the NCAA championship she so deeply desired, but she walked away knowing she’d gained so much more. “In the end, I knew I did exactly what I was born to do, using every capability contained inside of me.”The Only WayVance and Madison inspire me.  So do others like them who refuse the excuses and follow their hearts against all odds.  Because of them, I realize that being “me”, in exactly the way I was born to be, is the only way to truly live.Photo by: Esparta 10 Things We Can’t Have Without the Other|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/one-without-other.jpg?resize=472%2C200&ssl=1|Because one without the other makes less sense than none at all…Ideas rose in clouds;

school my parents told me it didn’t matter what I did when I grew up, so long as it made me happy.  “Happiness is the whole point of life”, my father said.  “Your mother loves to help people, so she became a nurse.  I love reading, writing and poetry, so I became an English teacher.  We both find happiness in the work we do each day.”A few years later when I was in junior high, my grumpy 6th grade homeroom teacher put me in detention for “being difficult”.  She went around the classroom and asked each student what they wanted to be when they grew up.  When she got to me, I told her I wanted to be happy.  She told me I was missing the whole point of the question.  I told her she was missing the whole point of life.What do we all want to be when we grow up?  Happy… that is all.  Find what makes you happy and do it until you die.Photo by: Mareen Fischinger 34 Reminders to Help You Find Your Way|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/33-reminders.jpg?resize=464%2C208&ssl=1|We’ll kick-off this list of reminders with one of our favorite poems, “The Guy in the Glass” by Dale Wimbrow.When you get what you want in your struggle for pelf,And the world makes you King for a day,Then go to the mirror and look at yourself,And see what that guy has to say.For it isn’t your Father, or Mother, or Wife,Who judgment upon you must pass.The feller whose verdict counts most in your lifeIs the guy staring back from the glass.He’s the feller to please, never mind all the rest,For he’s with you clear up to the end,And you’ve passed your most dangerous, difficult testIf the guy in the glass is your friend.You may be like Jack Horner and “chisel” a plum,And think you’re a wonderful guy,But the man in the glass says you’re only a bumIf you can’t look him straight in the eye.You can fool the whole world down the pathway of years,And get pats on the back as you pass,But your final reward will be heartaches and tearsIf you’ve cheated the guy in the glass.Everyone and everything seems normal from a distance.When you die you can’t take anything or anyone with you.  This includes your family, friends, money and belongings.  Memories are all that remain.  Make them count.If you are breathing now, congratulations!  You still have a chance to fulfill your bucket list.  Don’t hesitate.Don’t make public generalizations about sex, race or age.  Doing so will almost certainly bite you in the ass.When something is troubling your worried mind, ask yourself this question:  “Will this issue really make a difference in my life one year from now?”  If the answer is no, move on.The key to saving and maintaining a relationship starts with two simple words:  “I’m sorry.”Never underestimate the joy of life’s simple pleasures… like the pull-through parking spot.Live in a few different cities, states, or even countries before your time is up.  The life experiences gained in each location will open your eyes again and again for the first time.Beginnings and endings… Both are powerful.  Both are memorable.  Both are necessary.  Don’t be afraid to start.  Don’t be afraid to bring something to an end.Alcohol fogs your judgment… Sometimes for the best, and sometimes for the worst.  Use accordingly.Why wait to look back on it and laugh?  You may as well laugh about it now.You will appear far smarter in the eyes of others if you simply pay attention to the details they care about, rather than attempting to impress them with your wits.  For example, if your boss always has Johnny Cash playing in the background when you walk past his office, mention it to him.  Ask him what his favorite album is.  Share your favorite song, etc.Lessons cannot be taught, they can only be learned.Compliments go a long way.  When given the chance, always make people feel good about themselves.True wisdom is achieved through life experience.  No book or classroom can teach this.Don’t give other people advice in the gym unless they ask for it.Don’t argue or flirt with someone via email or text messaging.  Most people are not poets.  The message will get lost in translation, and may end up in the wrong hands altogether.Appearance isn’t everything, but it’s something.  Purposely neglecting your appearance for the sake of it is just as foolish as judging a book by its cover.A little preparation will always save you a lot of grief.The better mood your boss is in at work, the better mood you’re in at work.  Help him or her help you.You cannot do everything, but you can do something.  Make it count.A small gift from the heart is always better than a large gift from a shopping list.Dreams will remain dreams forever if you don’t take action.As long as you are alive, there is always more to learn.Enjoy yourself.  The situation is always lighter than you think.What you learn in school does matter.  While you may not use the specifics of every classroom lesson, every lesson does expand the core thought process of your mind. Over time you will develop problem solving skills that are universally applicable.  No single classroom lesson can teach this, and no single classroom lesson is more important.Own up to your mistakes the instant you realize you’ve made them.  People will respect your honesty, and your conscience will thank you.Concentrate on the things that you can change, forget about the rest.Maintain your body, but never be ashamed of it.  It’s the greatest tool you’ll ever own.Don’t let mistakes from the past corrupt your future ambitions.In life and in love, you get what you put in.Don’t spend your whole life waiting for the ‘right time’.In many cases you will learn more from failure than you will from success.Become a critical thinker and always be skeptical of those who dish-out advice.  As such, weigh each of these tips against your own experience and judgment.Photo by: Your Guide "
"Your Life’s Story Told in One Sentence|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/one-sentence.jpg?resize=464%2C291&ssl=1|Constraints make us focus.  They force us to zero-in on a specific purpose.  The less material we have to work with, the more resourceful we must be.  Can you sum up your entire outlook on life in one sentence?  Do you have a personal motto you live your life by?  How about a maxim that perfectly summarizes your thoughts and beliefs, the very principles and values you uphold and apply on a daily basis? ‘You’ in a Few WordsThis is your inner dictum, the adage with which you conduct yourself.  Maybe you unconsciously put it together when you were young by watching a childhood hero, or perhaps you were inspired by someone you knew who struggled and succeeded against all odds.Whether you call it a slogan, a motto, or a mission sentence, the idea is to use the advantage of constraints to capture ‘you’ and all that you stand for in as few words as possible.What’s the point?To construct a single sentence that embraces your aspirations, values, passions, and purpose.  All these points motivate us.  They shape who we are, the way we live, the choices we make, and the paths we follow.  They are extremely important to know because they impact our lives whether we are aware of them or not.  You have already been living according to your mission sentence even if you didn’t realize it. You just haven’t consciously defined it yet.Bear in mind, a mission sentence is worthless if it isn’t true to ‘you’.  It should represent something you are, not something you aren’t, never have been, or never will be.A Powerful ToolWhen you define your mission sentence, you craft a powerful tool for yourself.  You create an abbreviation of all your goals, values, and passions… a guiding symbol of your life’s story.  It doesn’t necessarily have to be a phrase others will understand.  It’s not for them or for promotional purposes.  It’s for you.Remember, words are not actually the things they represent. You cannot eat the word “delicious,”  “Delicious” is a just word that represents the sweet greatness of a tasty treat.That’s what your mission sentence is all about, a clear representation of the greatness that is you.Look inside yourself.  What’s your mission sentence?As for me, I’ve lived by the same one for the last decade: “Trying is my business.”Photo by: Mark78 10 Reasons You Are Rich|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/you-are-rich.jpg?resize=464%2C328&ssl=1| Even in times of financial uncertainty, it’s always important to keep things in perspective.Wealth is the ability to fully experience life.– Henry David ThoreauYou didn’t go to sleep hungry last night.You didn’t go to sleep outside.You had a choice of what clothes to wear this morning.You hardly broke a sweat today.You didn’t spend a minute in fear.You have access to clean drinking water.You have access to medical care.You have access to the Internet.You can read.You have the right to vote.Some might say you are rich, so remember to be grateful for all the things you do have.Photo by: Carfe How To Avoid The Biggest Mistake You Always Make|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/procrastinating.jpg?resize=464%2C218&ssl=1| There are plenty of ways to sabotage your personal goals, dreams and desires.  Procrastination, however, is the number one killer.  Procrastinators self-destruct.  They hinder their own potential by placing colossal road-blocks along the path to success.  In other words, they subconsciously choose to fail.Nothing is so fatiguing as the eternal hanging on of an uncompleted task.– William James#1)  Beware of Perfectionism“It’s almost perfect… but not quite there yet.  Just a few more tweaks next week.”Sound familiar?  Perfectionism stirs procrastination.  It’s one of the easiest ways to blindly justify the act of putting things off.  When you’re knee deep in preparation, it can be difficult to decide when to stop “preparing” and start the process of actually “doing”. Remember, the state of perfection is an opinion.  Trying to verify that everything is subjectively perfect will paralyze you 100% of the time.#2)  Start Right NowThe best way to know if you’re ready is to start right now.   Then, if something isn’t working properly, change it.  That’s the beauty of progress.When I started my first side venture a few years ago I wasted a great deal of time waiting for the ideal moment, to get things just right, instead of spending more time on actionable steps to move my ideas forward.Are you waiting for success to magically blossom like I was?  Hoping that the stars will align and present you with the perfect moment to act?  Guess what?  No moment is better than this moment, so start now!The only way it will happen is if you make it happen.  So setup your goals, map out the necessary steps and start knocking them off one at a time.  You’ll be amazed by the power of momentum.  Once you start, it’s hard to stop.#3)  Complete 3 Simple Steps EverydayAt first glance, some tasks may seem mind-numbingly overwhelming, thus discouraging you from taking action.  The solution is to break down complex tasks into simple, logical steps.  I’ve said it before, take one bite of the elephant at a time.The key to success is the sum of 3 steps a day.  Dedicate yourself to completing 3 simple steps everyday that bring you closer to your goal.  That’s it.  It may only be 3 steps today, but you’ll complete 21 steps by this time next week and 84 steps by this time next month.  The more you get done, the faster you’ll go, the easier it will get, and the closer you will be to your desired end result.Bottom LineYour life is short!  Don’t waste it in a state of procrastination!Photo by: emdot 18 Means for Living Below Your Means|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/live-below-your-means.jpg?resize=464%2C250&ssl=1|Live a comfortable life, not a wasteful one.  Do not spend to impress others.  Do not live life trying to fool yourself into thinking wealth is measured in material objects.  Manage your money wisely so your money does not manage you.  Always live well below your means.A penny saved is a penny earned.– Benjamin FranklinRedefine your definition of “rich”. – I remember sitting in a cubicle at my first professional job staring at a picture of an SUV I wanted to buy (and eventually did).  Now, I sit in my office and look at the pictures of my kids, and just outside my window I can see the beater I drive sitting in the company parking lot.  What a difference a decade makes!  To sum things up, my definition of being rich is having enough money to meet my family’s basic needs, a few of our wants, and to be able to give some away to others.Borrow and share. Everyone wins! – We borrowed a DVD from a friend instead of renting or buying and had a little snack from our own fridge!  Way cheaper than using gas to drive to the theater/rental place, paying for a movie or Amazon Prime, and paying for a snack.Avoid the mall. – Going to the mall is not entertainment!  We used to go when we were bored.  Of course, we usually ended up spending money while we were there.  If you need clothes, then shop sales or go to stores that offer name-brands at a discount.  You can save a ton on these items if you are a smart shopper.  Dave Ramsey says, “Never pay retail!”  We probably save $15 to $30 per month by staying away from the mall.Limit your intake of advertisements. – Advertising sucks.  That’s the cold, hard truth.  It’s engineered to make you feel like you’re incomplete, that you have an unfulfilled need, that you’re not good enough.Buy with cash. – You can’t spend money you don’t have.  Many bank accounts provide overdraft protection, so even with a debit card, it’s easier to go over your account balance than you think.Find a better deal and actually SAVE the difference. – Regardless of what they sell, if you’ve switched companies for price reasons, save the difference.  Think of phone companies, internet access, cell phones, credit cards, and others.Adhere to a long-term investment strategy. – I’m a long-term investor.  The stock portion of my portfolio is spread over several mutual funds, a few ETFs and a few individual stocks.  Each and every one of these holdings was carefully chosen, after thorough research.  I believe in these stocks and funds.  I consider them as my best bet in growing my money – LONG TERM.Curb your consumerism! – Have you ever watched how a child can play with a cardboard box for hours, and leave the toy that came in it by the wayside?  How is it that children can enjoy themselves without a lot of “stuff”, but we as adults feel the need to reward ourselves by buying more stuff?Stay Healthy!  Medical problems drain bank accounts. – James M. Rippe, M.D is a best-selling author, world-renowned cardiologist, and founder of the Rippe Lifestyle Institute.   He explains that if you look at all the risk factors for dying, the one that is most predictive is fitness level.  In addition, an older person with high cardiovascular fitness is healthier than a younger person who is physically inactive.  By increasing your fitness level, you can actually roll back your biological clock.Stay in and relax. – So, think about it the next time you go out.  Are you going for with a purpose?  Maybe the solution is to not go out at all.  Stay home and save!  Save up for something you really want or need.Gradually prepare yourself for a rainy day. – Even when things are going great, and you feel on top of the world, you must always be prepared for a change.  If you take the time and patience to set yourself up properly, then when things to take a turn for the worse, you will be prepared to handle it.  If you live above your means, then when the slightest change occurs, you will not be prepared to adapt.  Financial flexibility is more important then keeping up with the Jones’.Stop competing.  Forget about the Jones’ altogether. – If getting rich makes us happy, then why don’t countries as a whole get happier as they grow wealthier?  They discovered that as a country gets wealthier there’s no overall increase in happiness.  Why?  We continually compare our wealth against that of others.  We are competitive and envious. Add to that the fact that Western countries encourage people to strive for more and more, and you have a formula that spins many into depression.Get out of the “easy street” mentality. – I think there is too much emphasis on the quick fix or the easy option in today’s society.  For example taking diet pills to lose weight instead of the “hard option” – exercising and eating well…. money is sometimes being used as a substitute for hard work.  Do you think there is an increasing expectation that you can get want you want by throwing money around instead of working hard and “earning” it?Avoid impulse buying.  Buy things you truly need. – Don’t you just love the excitement you feel after coming home with a new TV?  Driving home in a new car?  Opening the box on a new pair of shoes?  I sure do.  But, from watching the behavior of myself and my friends I’ve found that the new quickly becomes just another item.  The excitement of novelty passes quickly.Time is money.  Properly manage your time. – The fewer tasks you have, the less you have to do to organize them.  Focus only on those tasks that give you the absolute most return on your time investment, and you will become more productive and have less to do.  You will need only the simplest tools and system, and you will be much less stressed.  I think that’s a winning combination.  Focus always on simplifying, reducing, eliminating. And keep your focus on what’s important. Everything else is easy.Find ways to give without spending. – Want a quick, easy and (almost) free way to be guaranteed that you’ll make someone’s day special?  Send them a letter.  Why not set aside some time this weekend to sit down and write to a few people?  If you don’t enjoy writing, try buying some nice postcards of your home town.  If you’ve got an artistic streak, why not design your own note cards?  You don’t have to write a long letter for it to be effective.  It’s the thought that counts and the personal touch that makes it special.Don’t let greed and deceit get the best of you. – According to Stephen R. Covey, if you reach an admirable end through the wrong means it will ultimately turn to dust in your hands.  This is due to unintended consequences that are not seen or evident at first.  The example he gives in The 8th Habit is:  The parent who yells at their kids to clean their rooms will accomplish the end of having a clean room.  But this very means has the potential to negatively affect relationships, and it is unlikely the room will stay clean when the parent leaves town for a few days.  Now, to return to the topic of wealth, I think it is possible to see much of the world’s current financial problems as stemming from people who wrongly believe the ends justify the means.  My advice?  It is fine to aspire to wealth, but don’t lose sight of the means to accomplishing it.Never ever pay retail. – You can easily save hundreds of dollars a year on clothing purchases by waiting for sales or shopping at discount retailers like Marshalls.  Better yet, avoid name brand clothing all together.Also, check out these best selling books for more financial tips:I Will Teach You To Be RichThe Money Book for the Young, Fabulous, & BrokeThe 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New RichPhoto by: CayUSA How Ignorance Can Lead to Success|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/ignorance-success.jpg?resize=464%2C207&ssl=1|What you don’t know just might help you.  Being unaware of presently accepted, communal beliefs can put you a step ahead of the herd.  It’s like an artist building a masterpiece from a blank canvas.  Sometimes it’s better to begin from a clean slate, to create your own way without polluting your mind with external inputs.  Here are a couple examples:The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance,it is the illusion of knowledge.– Daniel BoorstinThe Route Less TraveledIn the late 1990’s my father got an itch to start investing.  He had a decent sum of cash sitting in a savings account and decided it was time to put his money to work.  The savings account returned about 1.5% a year, so any return above that would be a successful investment. At the time, the dot com boom was at its inception and everyone was pumping money into tech stocks.  My father didn’t fully understand the stock market and its inherent risks, so instead of investing in tech stocks, he purchased 15 acres of land in an upcoming neighborhood near Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.  He never lost a dime when the dot com bubble busted, and even after the recent downturn in the housing market, his property is currently worth 8 times what he paid for it.She Didn’t Know Any BetterAbout a year ago a friend of mine wrote an eBook and put it up for sale on her blog.  I jokingly pointed out to her that all of the information in the eBook was readily available on other blogs/websites for free and indexed correctly by Google.  She was disappointed when I mentioned this, but she left her eBook up for sale anyway.  We both assumed it wouldn’t sell.  We were wrong.  The eBook has sold to the sum of nearly $4K since last summer.The LessonsThese two stories carry two significant lessons:The popular way of doing things is not always the best way.Sometimes taking action based on ignorance beats taking no action at all.Knowledge is important.  But occasionally what we know (or what we think we know) hinders our ability to take action and make sound judgments.  We become consumed with commonly accepted practices and thus fail to innovate.  We follow the herd instead of thinking for ourselves.Doing things the same way they’ve always been done is a sure way to never get ahead.  Just because other people have done things a certain way doesn’t make it right.  Quite often you will find the exact opposite to be true.Being ignorant of popular opinion is a good mindset to be in.  It allows you to form your own opinions based on firsthand experience.  It gives you the freedom to think and to innovate.  Oddly enough, the right kind of ignorance can give you the power to succeed.Photo by: Xabier Martinez "
"4 Secrets of the Successfully Self-Employed|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/secrets-self-emplyed.jpg?resize=464%2C206&ssl=1|#1 – We Only Have 2 Products: Time and KnowledgeNo matter how you make a living or who you think you work for, you only work for one person, yourself.  Likewise, you only have 2 products to sell, your time and your knowledge.  Here are a few example scenarios:Migrant Farmer – Sells hours of his/her life to pick fruit or vegetables for a farmer in exchange for money.  A perfect example of trading hours for dollars.Doctor – Sells hours of his/her life to perform medical treatments based on the knowledge stored in his/her brain.  A perfect example of trading hours and knowledge for dollars.Best-Selling Author – Spends time crafting a book based on his/her knowledge or intellectual capacity and then sells the book (knowledge) many times over.  A perfect example of trading knowledge for dollars.  The key benefit here is residual, passive income.In almost all cases of the self-employed, the small business owner is taking information out of his or her brain and spending the necessary time to convert it into a product of value.  This concept confuses some people, and to others it seems obvious.  The bottom line is that customers pay you for your time and knowledge.  Success is achieved by properly crafting the two into one convenient bundle that can be sold many times over (think of products vs. services).What knowledge do you have in your brain that provides value to others?  How can you extract this information and sell it?#2 – The Implementation of Knowledge is PowerKnowledge alone is not power!  The implementation of knowledge is power.  Knowledge is simply a commodity; it’s a product like any other that has the potential to be sold.  How knowledge is organized, packaged, presented, shared, and received by others is what makes knowledge so powerful.Knowledge is useless unless it’s effectively shared with others.  Your ability to educate others in a way that allows them to effectively apply the instruction is what makes knowledge an asset… something worth buying.#3 – Time is More Valuable than MoneyOne of the most important points to understand is the fact that there are two basic forms of currency, money and time.  Of the two, time is the most valuable, for it cannot be replenished.  A surplus of time, and the unfettered liberty to do with it as you choose, is the true measure of success.Your time must be extracted from the formula of making money.  No matter how skilled you are at transferring your knowledge to others, if you are paid on an hours for dollars basis, your ability to expand your business will eventually plateau.  You will run out of time. The successfully self-employed have made this realization and concentrate the majority of their time and effort on the single greatest secret of self-employment: generating passive income.  Passive income is achieved by applying what you know into a package that can be designed and built once, and then repeatedly sold over and over again.  Finding a unique way to promote and sell this knowlege is the key.Passive Income Examples: Useful books and guides, time saving computer applications, etc.#4 – Success is About Knowing What You WantSelf-employed success is not the byproduct of working your way up from the ground up.  It’s based on knowing what you want, understanding your abilities and implementing them diligently to achieve your goals.  There are plenty of people who get laid-off from their 9 to 5 day job and end up making millions in a few short years of self-employment.Take a look at some of the success stories around you that emerged from nowhere.  These success stories were not initiated by people paying their dues to someone else’s initiatives.  These success stories revolve strictly around perception and choice.  The people in these stories know their capabilities, what they’re doing, and what they want.  Once people make this realization, and the conscious choice to act on it, the possibilities for success are limitless.Photo by: TeeJe 77 Keys to Living Well Before You

in productivity saves time, the most valuable constituent of life.  Take heed to these swift tips and the victory dance shall be yours.If you want to catch fish, and really enjoy the sport, youwill maintain your lures and line in some organized fashion.The best at it will always have their tackle ready.– David AllenClutter hinders productivity.  Clear clutter.  – “Trash what you don’t need.  Get rid of the duplicates of the duplicates.  And quickly delete those e-mails or attachments from your mother or your best friend that you “just have to forward.”  Yeah, they’re funny, cute, and heartwarming, but they are cluttering up your life and your inbox!” – via Frugal DadCreate a dedicated workspace for yourself. – “Do not share your workspace with wives, girlfriends, work associates (you may not have any say in this one). People need a sense of ownership in their tools. They need to know that the tool that they need that minute is available and not being used by someone else.” – via Black Belt ProductivityThe first step is the most important step.  Take it. – “The most difficult part of investing is taking that first step. Writing that first check and sending it off to open an account is where many people falter in the process. It’s always easier to procrastinate and “give it some thought,” but you will have no success until you begin.” – via The Wisdom JournalCreate separate to-do lists for the home, office, grocery store, etc. – “Basically, you need to ask yourself: What can I accomplish right now, based on where I am and what tools are in front of me? and then focus only on those tasks. GTD simplifies that process by breaking down your lists into separate contexts, so you only need to worry about the context you’re in right now, and not about any other contexts” – via Zen HabitsAsk yourself: Why am I really doing this? – “We fool ourselves into thinking that we are doing something because we want to accomplish an audacious goal, but in reality we may be doing it for someone else.  You have to do some soul searching and make sure that you really want to accomplish this goal.” – via Work Happy NowConcentrate on the most important tasks. – “I for one have never accomplished everything I’ve ever needed to do in one day.  But that’s the very reason why trying to do too much will set us up for failure.  To put it bluntly, if we think we’ll successfully check off a 20-item to-do list within 24 hours, we’re kidding ourselves.” – Simple MomIf you fail to plan, you plan to fail. – “The most strategic time to think about the actions you need to take is not when you need to perform them, but beforehand, when you have perspective. When you execute from an inventory of predefined tasks, you can act rather than react, and your menu of options is much easier to prioritize.” – via Tools For ThoughtFocus.  Focus.  Focus. – “I am suggesting from personal experience that having one primary focus and diving into it completely with all your being will give you a higher chance at success.  Having said that, you are free to work on multiple goals at the same time, some people can pull it off without stress, most cannot.” – via Think Simple NowDo it right the first time. – “Why do a job if you aren’t going to do it right?  We need to develop the habit of giving every task our best effort.  Excellence should be the standard we strive for in all we do.  We can’t start letting ourselves or our children do the least possible to get by.  If we do, then they are going to receive less than the best results from their work.” – via My Super-Charged LifeBatch small tasks together and knock them off at once. – “Group up all of your small tasks (taking out the garbage, fixing a door hinge, organizing binders, etc.) and do them all at once.  This can help speed things along since there will be fewer interruptions in your regular workflow.” – via Pick The BrainOnly spend time on the things you CAN control. – “Our impulsive thoughts always tend to waste our life-energy by focusing on things that we cannot control… Dwell more on what you can do rather than what you cannot.  It’s not the circumstances that cause us to react in a certain way, it’s rather a certain way we choose to react to the circumstances that matters most to win against the odds.” – via Success SoulSet time limits for yourself. – “One of the simplest things I do to increase my productivity is to use a timer throughout the day. I don’t always need it, but on days when I need the boost, it is the first thing I turn to.  For 30 minutes, I work like this, racing the clock and challenging myself to have it all done before the buzzer goes off.  By the end, I am exhilarated, accomplished, and feel relaxed because I am no longer looking at what was an overwhelming mess 30 minutes earlier.” – via Remodeling This LifeUse your talents to your advantage. – “If you’ve got good people skills, then it means taking the time to engage as many folks as you can in conversation.  Whatever your best talents are, use them as often as possible.  It’s always good to stretch yourself, but there’s no reason not to use your natural talents to your advantage.” – via On SimplicityTake one bite of the elephant at a time. – “It’s important to know how long to run a race before you start. Starting off a marathon by sprinting isn’t going to get you to the finish line. Similarly, taking on every possible GTD, lifehack or to-do list upgrade at the same time isn’t a winning strategy.” – via The Change BlogDon’t get blindsided.  Always read the fine print. – “Why are they calling this a tax credit?  Have you heard about the new $7,500 first-time home buyer tax credit?  It’s not a credit at all, it’s a loan!  Granted it’s a 0% interest loan, but it’s still a loan.  Let’s call it what it is!” – via My Dollar PlanUse tricks to keep the momentum going. – “Probably the best way to counteract fatigue is to keep your toes tapping.  Find music that is upbeat, energetic and conducive to the environment you’re trying to create.” – via The Cranking Widgets BlogReduce your stress by reducing your commitments. – “Given that we have these tensions in our lives, and that they cause some level of mental stress, how do we resolve them? There are two possibilities: Eliminate the source, or structure them so as to feel as if they’re eliminated.” – Matt’s Idea BlogAlways be ready to capture your ideas. – “As a serial entrepreneur, I’m addicted to ideas.  I feed off of ‘em.  And nothing makes me more upset than having a great idea… and losing it.  Ideas never happen at opportune times, and having the proper idea capture tools can make sure that you’ll capture all your ideas for later processing.” – via LifeDevCommunicate clearly.  Get straight to the point. – “Too Wordy: If you are overly verbose in your blog post, you’ll lose not only the point of what you’re trying to say, but you’ll lose your readers as well.  Keep it simple; get to the point and you can’t go wrong.” – via Create Business GrowthMotivate others.  Inject energy into your environment. – “When a dance floor is empty at a party, most people simply won’t be the first people to start dancing, even if they want to.  It often takes somebody who is confident and who is acting through their intentions (doing what they want to do) to dance before others.  This is then a trigger to others that allows them to start dancing as it seems normal.” – via PluginIDDo more work when you’re motivated. – “Why I do this?  Because there will be times when I’m just super lazy and nothing can change it.  By doing extra work when I’m motivated, I will feel less guilty about being lazy sometime later… and I’ll get more done.” – via LessonInLifeKeep yourself healthy so you can actually get things done. – “With winter on its way, its time to start keeping our immune systems in top shape. Boosting immunity can come from a variety of different factors including how you handle stress, exercise and eating.” – via Zen to FitnessBonus:  How To Get Things Done in 1 Minute – “A crystal clear,

can also see how the transition introduces obvious limitations.  Suddenly you have dependent beings of life to care for.  Responsibility kicks in, compelling you to dedicate a significant portion of

"8 Ways to Inspire Others|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/inspire-others.jpg?resize=464%2C235&ssl=1|This guest post was written by Mike King, the author of Learn This.Have you ever looked up to someone or admired something about another person that really inspired you?  Well, there are certain qualities about a person’s character that enable them to inspire others, and there are steps you can take to awaken these same qualities in yourself.  Here’s how:Stick With What You LoveInspiring others isn’t easy.  The success rate of those who attempt to inspire is incredibly low when the measurement of success is based on the percentage inspired as opposed to the actual number inspired.  Huge motivational seminars with thousands of attendees typically make a real lasting impact in only a few people’s lives.  If you look at those same odds for yourself, you might easily be discouraged if you hope to inspire others by doing something you don’t truly love to do.If, however, you do love something dearly, you won’t care how successful you are at inspiring others and you will continue to persevere (on many levels) no matter how many times you fail.  When people doubt you, and when people laugh at your failures, you will continue to do what you love because you love it.  So having that depth, that love and passion for something, will protect you from all potential failures.Will you make the most of failures and continue to drive your passions?  Will you inspire others even when you don’t succeed at first?  What do you love?Think Big and NobleOnce you establish a foundation for which you have great passion, start thinking big.  How many people could you potentially inspire based on your niche of expertise?  Are there ways you can expand your impact?  Don’t look to inspire one person, look to inspire hundreds!  Remember, this goes back to the low success rate percentages, as you will likely not succeed with working to inspire at a very small level.  You need to think big and have many people available to inspire.  Fifty people out of a thousand is only five percent, but it’s still fifty people.  Share your ideas with as many people as possible and allow them grow your influence beyond your initial ideas for inspiration.Thinking big is not only about inspiring more people, but also about the impact you have on each person.  Don’t settle on making minor changes in a person’s life if they need a total makeover.  Instead, aim to change everything.  Look to inspire in many areas instead of just one.  Think big about the positive impact you might have and this will give you a much better chance of leaving some kind of impression.  If you promote a hundred ways for someone to change or heal and they take on just one, you have still helped them!Another useful way to inspire others is to support an established noble cause or practice, such as saving the environment or feeding the poor.  It’s much easier to gain attention, followers, and support for noble causes than it is for individual gain or what some might think are more selfish reasons.  An offer to change something that has a positive impact on the global society is far more attractive to onlookers than some short lived, localized venture.  So keep those areas of influence as big as possible!Be ExpressivePassion is something you must have and be willing to express it if you really want to inspire others.  You can gain a lot of influence just by publically expressing that you are excited and passionate about a topic.  You make it much harder to inspire others if you are boring an unenthusiastic.  Expressive passion is contagious because of the curiosity it stirs in others.  You’ll get people wondering why you love what you love so much.  Naturally, some of them will take the time necessary to understand what it is about the topic that moves you.Practice What You PreachYou need to remain actively involved in the field in which you intend to inspire others.  It’s the age old saying of “practice what you preach,” and it holds true for anyone trying to inspire others.  Ultimately, if you really want to inspire others to do something then this ‘something’ should be a big part of your life.  You don’t necessarily need to be an expert at it, but you do need to be passionately involved.Keep an Open DoorYou must always maintain an open invitation to everyone you encounter.  Personally welcome others, and listen to their needs.  Once you are involved with them, keep it personal and always maintain a healthy line of communication.Offer a Guiding HandThe best part of inspiring others is to have interest in not only what you do, but to also recognize your followers and have an opportunity to see them grow and change as well.  Offer to share your personal stories, teach them things you’ve learned along the way, talk about your failures and achievements, and ask them questions about their own progress.  Help them avoid the mistakes you’ve made in the past, and always maintain a positive outlook on their forward progress.Be ConsistentConsistency in actions, information, and moral standards is also extremely important.  If you constantly change your methods, your interests, and the field in which you hope to inspire others, you will have little success.  People want to see and associate your ideas with a reliable plan that they can follow.  You need to demonstrate this consistency through your actions, but you can also compliment your actions with inspirational story telling.  Story telling allows you to reproduce important past experiences as a means to guide and inspire others.  Make sure use stories that embrace the consistency of your actions.Stay PositiveThe process of inspiring others comes with no shortage challenges and negative naysayers.  To get past this, you must stay positive, work past failures, and present optimism openly to others no matter what the circumstances are.  Doubt is a very contagious disease, and if you show any of it, you can easily destroy any positive influence you might have instilled in a person.And there you have it: My thoughts on how to inspire others.  I’d love to hear your feedback, thoughts and comments on the subject.  Which of these points have the biggest impact to you?  Have I left something out?  Do you have any personal experiences or inspirational stories to

post has moved to HERE:The Unwritten Love Poem: Why True Love is So Hard to Express How To Forgive Yourself and Others|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/how-to-forgive.jpg?resize=464%2C244&ssl=1|Pain, resentment, guilt, anger, and fear… all of these feelings bubble up inside of us when we think back on our mistakes or the mistakes of those dear to us.  Sometimes the only healthy way to move forward is to look back at our past and inject forgiveness into our lives.Some say “forgive and forget.”  Others say “forgive, but never forget.”  No matter which path you choose, the act of forgiving is the first step.  Here are three simple ways to bring more forgiveness into your life.Forgive YourselfIn general, we tend to be harder on ourselves than we are on others.  If you’ve made mistakes in the past, it’s time to let your spirit heal by forgiving yourself.  We all do things we aren’t proud of.  Understand that you were doing the best you could at the time, with the experiences and knowledge you had accessible to you.Self-forgiveness tips:Pick an area of your life you would like to work on.  It could be failed relationships, family problems, or business mistakes.Make a list of all of the people you might have hurt along the way.  This is the toughest part because we tend to bury some of these stressful memories.  So be honest with yourself and take your time.After you’ve compiled your list, systematically go through each person on the list.  Think about the situation, validate the circumstances, and forgive yourself for hurting them.   As odd as it may feel, apologize aloud to yourself, “I forgive myself for hurting this person,” and take a deep breath.  Once you’ve completed this practice you’ll instantly feel a slight sense of relief.Remember, the simple act of acknowledging your mistakes is always half the battle.Ask for ForgivenessOnce you forgive yourself, it’s also important to clear the air with others.  A face to face apology is always the most effective approach.  Depending on the situation, you might be afraid to ask for forgiveness.  But if you don’t ask, you will never feel the relief of being pardoned for your mistakes.If you absolutely can’t bring yourself to ask for forgiveness in person, I still recommend writing a letter of forgiveness.  The reason writing a letter works so well is that the process of writing the letter actually assists you in forgiving yourself by reducing pent-up, internal feelings of guilt.  It lets you express your thoughts and process all of the internal drama that has bottled-up in your mind. Tips for writing your letter of forgiveness:Don’t do it out of spite, or because you think it will elevate you to higher moral ground.  No good ever arises from deception.Realize that a letter can’t undo the damage.  A letter of forgiveness might not be enough to change your relationship with the recipient, but it’s a significant step in the right direction.Explain your rationale, but don’t make excuses for your behavior.  Own up to your actions and take responsibility.  Offer to fix the situation, or find a way to make it up to the person.Make a sincere wish for the well-being of the person you hurt.  After many years of festering emotions, you may have come to hate the act of thinking about this person.  Stop being selfish!  It’s time to be honest and compassionate.Hopefully, just writing the letter will allow you to move closer to a positive resolution on all fronts.Forgive OthersIf you’ve been hurt in the past, you don’t need to keep suffering.  Whether or not you’ve gotten closure is irrelevant.  You have the ultimate power to clear the air by simply forgiving those who have hurt you.You should make a list of all of the people who have done something that still troubles you to this day. The list might start out small, but as you unwind your memories you are bound to find more people and incidents than you were previously aware of.Your mind represses these memories in an effort to preserve your conscious sanity.  The drawback is that you probably haven’t processed these events properly.  So while you aren’t actively thinking about them, they are quietly tugging at your consciousness and robbing you of mental energy.Tips for forgiving others:Close your eyes and picture the person standing in front of you.In your mind’s eye, explain to them how you felt then, how you feel now, and what happened during those hurtful times.After you’ve stated your views, let them acknowledge your pain.  Watch their reactions and wait for a response.  There’s a good chance they will understand your point of view.Then hug them and tell them that you forgive them.  Yes!  Really do this with all of your emotional might, it’s a powerful process!  Release them from your troubled past and let your thoughts come back to the present.After completing only a few of these processes, you’ll find yourself breathing deeper and interacting differently with these people.  Regardless of whether or not they are still a part of your daily life, you will forever see them in a more positive light… which will ultimately make your future brighter.Photo by: Kalandrakas How To Walk On Water|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/walk-on-water.jpg?resize=464%2C239&ssl=1|This past Sunday I was relaxing at the water’s edge of a local beach when a young boy ran full speed right by me and into the shallow surf.  He continuously hopped up and down as he was running forward, kicking his little legs in the air and across the surface of the water before inevitably falling face-first into the waves.  He got back up and repeated this act several times, each time with more determination than the previous attempt.  It became obvious that he was trying to run across the surface of the water.  I couldn’t help but to laugh.  His combined levels of determination and exertion were priceless.After several attempts, he noticed my laughter and walked over to me.  “What’s so funny?” he asked.“You remind me of me, and it makes me smile.” I said.“Do you know how to walk on water?” he asked. “Like a superhero?”“Well, I think I can help you out.” I said. “Let me give you a few pointers.”Curious, the boy sat down on the sand next to me.  His mother scurried over, worried… but I reassured her that her son wasn’t bothering me.  Relieved, perhaps, to have her son sitting safely on the sand instead of flying face-first through the air, she went back to her beach chair 20 feet away and continued a conversation with another lady.“So, you want to walk on water, eh?” I asked.  He nodded his head anxiously.A Rough Summary of What I Told HimMake sure you were born to walk on water. – You must follow your heart, and be who you were born to be.  Some of us were born to be musicians… to communicate intricate thoughts and rousing feelings with the strings of a guitar.  Some of us were born to be poets… to touch people’s hearts with exquisite prose.  Some of us were born to be entrepreneurs… to create growth and opportunity where others saw rubbish.  And still, some of us were born to walk on water… to invent the capability of doing so.  If you’re going to walk on water, you better feel it in every fiber of your being.  You better be born to do it!Decide that nothing can stop you. – Being born to walk on water isn’t enough by itself.  We must each decide to accept our calling.  Unfortunately, most of us make excuses instead.  “But I might drown trying,” we say.  Or, “But I have a family to think about first.”  Walking on water, or doing anything that hasn’t been done before, requires absolute, unconditional dedication.  The only person who can control your level of dedication is you.  If you’re serious about walking on water, you must decide that nothing… not gravity, not a group of naysayers, NOTHING… can stop you!Work on it for real. – While many of us decide at some point during the course of our lives that we want to answer our calling… to accomplish our own version of walking on water, only an astute few of us actually work on it.  By “working on it”, I mean truly devoting oneself to the end result.  The rest of us never act on our decision.  Or, at best, we pretend to act on it by putting forth an uninspired, half-ass effort.  But to truly walk on water, you’ll have to study physics, rheology, hydrophobic substances, etc… and then you’ll have to define and redefine next-generation theories and complex hypotheses, which must be tested relentlessly.  When the tests fail, you must be ready to edit your theories and test them again.  This kind of work, the real kind, is precisely what enables us to make the impossible possible.Let the whole world know what you’re up to. – When you’re trying to walk on water, or do anything that nobody else has done before, life can get lonely pretty quickly.  To keep your motivation thriving, it’s important to let others know that you’re attempting to defeat the formerly impossible.  Don’t be shy!  Let the whole world know that you’re trying to walk on water.  No doubt, it’ll place a bit of extra pressure on your back, and you’ll almost certainly hear some laughter in the crowd.  But this kind of pressure fuels motivation, which is exactly what you’ll need to accomplish such a colossal undertaking.  And when you finally do succeed, the last bit of laughter heard will be your own.Value the people who value your ambitions. – When most people hear about your “mission impossible” aspirations, their natural reaction may be to roll their eyes, call you crazy, and tell you to quit being foolish.  But fortunately, the world is also inhabited by pioneers and believers who see the value in your dreams.  These people understand that achieving the formerly impossible is one of the greatest gifts human beings possess.  They’ll likely give you tips, bits of assistance, and the extra push you need to succeed.  These are extraordinary people, and you’ll want to surround yourself with them, because they will ultimately assist you over the hurdles and across the surface of the water.  Think of them as an influential, personal support team.  Without them, walking on water will be a far more difficult feat, if not completely impossible.Ignore the negative naysayers. – No matter how much progress you make, there will always be the people who insist that walking on water is impossible, simply because it hasn’t been done before.  Or they may incessantly suggest that the idea as a whole is utterly ridiculous because nobody really cares about walking on water anyways.  When you come across these people, don’t try to reason with them.  Instead, forget that they exist.  They will only waste your time and energy.Prepare yourself for the pain. – Even though you’re no longer mindlessly running face-first into the oncoming ocean surf, but instead forming complex theories based on the studies of rheology and fluid viscosity, it doesn’t mean you won’t experience your fair share of pain.  You’re in the business of walking on water, of doing something that has never been done before.  You’ll likely get a waterlogged, lungful of water on a regular basis.  But the pain will seem like a small price to pay when you become the first person to jog across the rapids of the Mississippi.Enjoy the pain of your greatest challenge. –  Superheroes aren’t real.  In real life nobody has ever walked on water.  But lots of people have achieved formerly impossible feats, and continue to enjoy the possibilities of new challenges.  These people will all tell you there’s nothing more gratifying than the thrill of your greatest challenge.  The inherent pains along the way are simply mile markers on your trip to the finish line.  When you finally do finish, you may actually find yourself missing the daily grind.  Ultimately, you’ll realize that pleasure and pain can be one and the same.Never give up!  Never quit! – The reason nobody has walked on water isn’t because people haven’t tried.  Remember, you just tried several times in a row, and I’m sure many others have too.  The reason nobody has succeeded is, simply, that within the scope of modern science and physics, it’s currently impossible.  But this doesn’t mean that with your help it won’t become possible in the future.  If you were born to do it and truly dedicate yourself to the end result, anything, including walking on water, is entirely possible!Just a ChanceWhen we were done talking, the young boy got up and ran back over to his mother.  He pointed over to me and I smiled and waved back.  Then he said to her, “Mommy, mommy!  That guy just taught me how to walk on water!”A few moments later she walked over to scold me for supposedly giving out reckless advice.  She told me I was giving her son a false sense of hope.  I told her all I was giving him was a chance.Photo by: Murilo Why Everyone Likely Agrees on the Meaning of Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/meaning-of-life.jpg?resize=464%2C205&ssl=1|Katie, a close friend of the family, is just 21 and already publicly out of the closet.  “I am deeply attracted to women.  I’m a lesbian,” she admits openly.  She has been involved in two long-term, intimate relationships in the last three years.  Both relationships were with women her age.  When I asked her why she lives this lifestyle, she said, “Because I feel like myself, completely alive, when I’m with another woman.  I can’t feel this way when I’m with a man.”Ryan, one of my grade school buddies, is now a Roman Catholic priest.  He has chosen to follow a life of abstinence, instead devoting himself wholeheartedly to God and the principles of his faith.  When I asked him why he chose to follow this path, he said, “Because I find peace and abundance through my faith.  It keeps me connected and allows me to make a difference.”Another friend, Courtney, an amateur bodybuilding competitor, is addicted to working out.  “I can’t go a day without it,” she says.  So she enters to the gym every morning at 5AM, performs a solid hour of weight training, and follows it up with another hour of cardio before heading off to work.  When I asked her why she partakes in such a rigorous workout routine, she said, “Working out makes me feel alive, energized and at peace.  It’s a way of life.”A fourth friend, Antony, is a remarkable chef.  He currently works at a fine Italian restaurant, but plans to open his own café in the near future.  Antony struggles with an obvious vice; he enjoys eating as much as he enjoys cooking.  His doctor recently told him he is nearly 60 pounds overweight.  When I asked him why he isn’t more concerned with his weight as it relates to his health, he said, “When I cook, I feel free… free to be human, free to be creative, free to be me.  When I eat what I cook, I experience the fruits of my labor.  There’s nothing more satisfying than that.”How fascinating.  Human beings draw on sexuality, faith, exercise, and cooking to achieve the same thing, a feeling of being alive, free, connected, self-fulfilled and at peace.The Meaning of LifePersonal development gurus, psychologists, politicians, philosophers, bloggers and various members of my social circle have frequently concluded that the future of humankind as a whole is in jeopardy because we all pursue life’s meaning in fundamentally incompatible ways.  I firmly oppose this conclusion.Life’s meaning, in my experience, is about the feeling of being alive, free, connected, self-fulfilled and at peace.  Whether we use sexuality, faith, exercise, or cooking as the means to attain this experience, we’re all in pursuit of the same thing.Human Beings Overshadow Their LabelsWhen I asked my lesbian friend if she could relate to a Catholic priest, she said no.  And when I asked my exercise-obsessed, athletic friend if she could relate to a chubby, Italian chef with no desire to maintain a healthy bodyweight, she said no.  In both cases, I wasn’t surprised with their answers.I then conducted a little social experiment:  I invited all four friends over for drinks at my condo this past Friday evening without informing them that the others were coming.  The outcome was rather insightful.When they transcended their informal labels (e.g. lesbian, priest, athlete, and chubby chef), and instead became real, live human beings occupying the same room together (e.g. Katie, Ryan, Courtney, and Antony), they all discovered powerful similarities among themselves as human beings that vastly overshadowed the vague differences they experienced as informal labels.A Universal StruggleI believe the worst thing we can do as human beings is to interpret our own pursuit of life’s meaning as fundamentally incompatible and dissimilar from the pursuits of others.  Our basic pursuits in life aren’t that different.  Thus, labeling them as different only isolates us from each other, which ultimately stifles the progress we can achieve together as a whole.The best thing we can do is to accept the fact that labels mean nothing, and realize that the seemingly nonsensical choices of others actually do make a lot of sense if we have the patience and fortitude to uncover the reasons behind these choices.  In doing so, we will likely expose the same universal struggle that drives our own pursuit:  To feel alive, free, connected, self-fulfilled and at peace.Photo by: J.

"Top 40 Ways to Take Notes Online|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/ways-to-take-notes-online.jpg?resize=464%2C257&ssl=1| Time isn’t money.  It’s the single greatest constituent of life.  The more time you create for yourself, the more time you have to live.  Thus, saving time is life saving.  If you’ve been feeling a day late and a buck short, you’ve been mismanaging your time… and your life. Here are 25 proven time saving tips employed by some of the wisest bloggers I know.  Each tip links back to a source article containing additional insight. Dost thou love life?  Then do not squander time,for that is the stuff life is made of.– Benjamin Franklin How Time Management Can Ruin Lives|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/time-management-ruins-lives.jpg?resize=464%2C298&ssl=1|Time is the school in which we learn.Time is the fire in which we burn.– Delmore SchwartzHis StoryTick-tock, tick tock…  It’s the pulse that endlessly beats through his mind.  He attempts to ignore it.  He jogs, reads, writes, drinks, chats, anything to distract its drumming.  But it persists.  The pulse follows him.  It calls to him.  Wherever, whenever… it’s always present. There is no idle time.  Tasks are due now.  Tasks are due soon.  Every moment is meticulously accounted for.  At work, at lunch, while socializing, even in bed with his wife… his mind wanders.  What time is it?  Where is the minute hand now?  He has to look.Tick-tock, tick-tock… the rhythm consumes him.  It’s inside of him.  And he knows it.  “It’s a part of who I am,” he tells his wife when she gets irritated with his rigidness.He sets the alarm to 5:00AM seven days a week, but he doesn’t need it.  Even on Sundays his eyes robotically pop open around 4:50AM.  It’s the internal pulse that arouses him.   His body simply knows it’s time.  Time for productivity.  Time for action.  It’s always time for something.The clock radio reads 4:00… now 4:01AM.  No, not yet!  It’s still too early.  One more hour of sleep… one more hour of peace.As he drives to work, a countdown plays out in his mind.  33 minutes before he arrives at the office.  2 hours and 48 minutes before the weekly marketing conference call.  5 days, 4 hours and 15 minutes before his bi-annual review.  1 month, 2 weeks, 3 days, 12 hours and 30 minutes before his spring vacation.And as his overloaded mind begins to spin, he thinks about what life would be like if he could just let go of it all… if the internal pulse died and allowed him to simply be in the moment, and live for the sake of existing.  “It would be blissful,” he says to himself.  “Sheer freedom!” He pulls into the parking lot at exactly 7:00AM, enters his office, and opens his desktop calendar.  After staring at it blankly for almost a full minute, he closes his eyes and pushes the palms of his hands against his forehead.  Overwhelmed, anxious, trapped… but conscious of what must be done.He slowly lowers his quivering hands, opens his eyes, and begins to draft his daily to-do list.Her StoryShe doesn’t manage her time.  In fact, she rarely knows what time it is.  In her mind, there are no deadlines.  She understands the concept of time management, and that others are bound by schedules, but she refuses to participate.  “Stop bothering me,” she says.  “My time is mine.”She doesn’t own an alarm clock, or a calendar, or even a cell phone.  If you question her ways, she’ll snicker and tell you, “You’re just another member of the corporate cattle herd… wasting your time to meet someone else’s agenda.”She’s totally free to do whatever she wants, whenever she wants.  A unique, free spirit in charge of her own destiny… completely immune to the forces that attempt to confine her.“Don’t lecture me on time management,” she exclaims.  “Instead, why don’t you ponder the last time you actually enjoyed yourself.  I bet, in your quest to satisfy needless commitments and fill a 9 to 5 quota, you enjoy yourself a lot less than I enjoy myself.  If you ask me, you’re the one wasting time!”Naturally, absolute freedom from the bounds of time has its inherent limitations.  Human beings cannot achieve goals without dedicating time to them.  Likewise, it’s impossible to coordinate productive social interactions without planning a time and space to do so.  Thus, she failed out of college, loses jobs faster than she finds them, and can’t maintain a healthy intimate relationship.  Even her closest friends have written her off as a failure.  And, to her parent’s dismay, she currently lives in their basement, rent free, at the ripe age of 29.Time Management is Like GravityTime management is like gravity.  Too much of it, and we’re stuck in place.  Not enough of it, and we’re lost in space.  We need it to live, but in moderation.Photo by: Matt Doane 25 Ways to Live 25 Hours a

stuff life is made of.– Benjamin FranklinSeek privacy. – “You may be totally different and I can respect that, but I need peace and quiet.  I feel stressed (and inefficient) when the TV is blaring, the dog is barking, the kids are shouting, the cat’s meowing, the phone is ringing, the microwave is beeping, the washer is running, the dryer is spinning, my Blackberry is vibrating, my email is dinging, etc.” – via The Wisdom JournalUse visual reminders. – “I’ve found it helpful to have visual reminders to do something that’s important to me.  One way to do this is writing on a piece of paper what you need to do, and in smaller text why you want to do it.  Tape this paper somewhere you will see it: bathroom mirror, in front of your bed, on your keyboard.  This doesn’t work if you have many reminders for different tasks, but for a couple of tasks, it can work magically.” – via Think Simple NowLive by the truth. – You will eventually do “hard time” for lying to yourself and others.  “The truth often comes out whether we want it to or not.  Lying generally just complicates the situation and makes us look bad.  Look at the scandals many of our politicians fall into because they fail to admit the truth.  It is much better to just develop the habit of telling the truth even when it is difficult.  This will save you a lot of heartache and misery in life.” – via My Super-Charged LifeDevelop a passive income stream. – “Passive income refers to income that is generated without any (or very little) additional time on our part.  Some time may be put in up front, but the payoff from passive income can last for years.  Every dollar you earn in passive income is a dollar you didn’t have to earn by working.  In this way, passive income puts you closer to financial independence, a stage of life where you no longer have to sell hours for dollars in order to earn an income.” – via Frugal DadComplaining kills time and energy.  Stop it! – “By complaining, I was putting the blame on external things instead of myself.  By noticing this habit, I’ve been able to lean into my fear and not let it decide my actions.  After becoming more aware of my thoughts and emotions, I’ve learned that if I don’t give in to my fears, I could choose actions that may be scary at first, but they would reap greater rewards in the end.” – via Work Happy NowTrick yourself into waking up early. – Don’t snooze your time away.  “A very effective trick I do is to place my alarm on the other side of the room, effectively forcing me to get out of bed to turn it off.”– via The Change BlogIt’s okay… Just say NO! – “While saying yes can take us down some wonderful roads, there’s also a ton of value in saying no.  We’re only given a certain amount of hours in our lives; do you really want to give yours away so easily?  If you don’t have to time to commit to a new project, complete a favor, or serve on another committee, it’s a good idea to just say no.” – via On SimplicityDelegate or hire a helping hand. – “What value do you place on your time during your waking hours?  Let’s say I had a great idea for a side business and the capital to get it rolling, but I didn’t have the time to get started.  I could channel some of that capital into hiring someone to do menial personal tasks, then channel my own time into the side business, seeing if there’s enough meat there to get things to really take off.” – via The Simple DollarUse technology to automate tasks. – “Don’t be dumb like me. Make sure your backups are automated so you don’t forget, because you will eventually.  For those first 2 years and 3 months, I felt like my website was invincible.  But everything goes down eventually.  Don’t trust yourself to make regular backups.  Leave that to a computer!” – via My Wife Quit Her JobStop trying to make things perfect. – “Perfection is an illusion.  We strive for perfection because we have an image in our minds of what we should be, but what we are not.  Realize that perfection and imperfection are a result of a conflict in your mind, they don’t exist in reality.  You have to make mistakes in order to grow, don’t let perfectionism paralyze you. If you’re not failing, chances are you’re not trying hard enough.” – via Illuminated MindResearch it before you commit lots of time to it. – “When creating an online business, the successful person starts his company after adequate success is certain, whereas he who is destined for bankruptcy first creates a product and then looks to see if it will be profitable.” – via Finance Your FreedomHaste makes waste.  Slow down. – A quicker, hasty pace in the short-term can lead to a more error prone set of results in the long-term.  “Sometimes things get in the way, like a sick child or a disastrous house.  Those days more than any other, I find the need to just stop, let things go for a little while and focus on being present is absolutely necessary.” – via Remodeling This LifeKeep your priorities straight. – “Assess the balance in your life by creating a pictorial representation of your life.  Using a pie chart you can easily see if your priorities in life are being met.  Hang it up somewhere that you can see it.  How does it look?  Does it look the way you want it to?” – via My Dollar PlanDon’t waste time worrying about the uncontrollable. – “The inevitable…  Some things we just can’t control.  So, aren’t we better off pushing worry aside?  And living our lives.  There will be good in our lives.  And there will be some bad in our lives.  Worrying about any of this is not going to change this fact.  What can change these facts are actions, by us.” – via The Jungle of LifeEnjoy yourself.  Misery is wasteful. – “Do you ever stop and think… Why am I doing all this stuff?  Do you ever feel like your sole purpose in life is crossing things off lists and maintaining your calendar?  Maybe if you aren’t enjoying yourself, all your time is wasted.  All that time we spend bored, frightened, angry, in a hurry, or unhappy, isn’t that the real waste of time?” – via Steve OlsonClear clutter from your home and workspace. – “Devote a little of your time to tossing clutter from your life, and keeping things relatively clutter-free, and you’ll be rewarded with much more pleasing living spaces, with a less stressful life, and with better organization and productivity. Clutter weighs us down, distracts us, and brings chaos into our lives.” – via Dumb Little ManTurn off the TV! – “People don’t incorporate enough engaging leisure and spiritual activities, such as socializing, exercising or reading books, into their day.  Despite having more leisure time than ever before, time spent on engaging leisure activities has actually declined over the past four decades.  Instead, there’s been a significant increase in the hours devoted to what the authors call “neutral downtime,” which is mostly watching television.” – via Mom GrindUtilize the power of compounding. – “I’m sure that everyone reading this understands the power of compound interest.  When you invest money you earn interest.  Then you start earning interest on the money you earned from interest.  Over many years this continues to compound and eventually leads to a very large sum of money.  The same concept applies to time.  If you invest time by working hard when you’re young, you put yourself in a position to succeed that will continue compounding for the rest of your life.  If you waste time when you’re young, you can’t make up for it later because you’ve lost the opportunity to utilize the power compounding.” – via Pick The BrainRead situations and anticipate outcomes. – “I would say that I have gotten better over time at reading situations and anticipating outcomes.  This helps me be more effective.  I’m still improving; let me give you an example.  Recently I gave permission to this construction company to have access to one of our lots to help them access an adjacent lot.  Since then, trucks have been wreaking havoc on my lot.  I got all pissed off and was telling my friend how disrespectful that was, making a mess of our lot, after I was so cool with them etc… His response was great.  He simply said, ‘Dude, what did you expect?’” – via Best Life PracticesIf you want to remember it, write it down. – “If your memory is anything like mine it’s like a leaking bucket.  And there are many great reasons to write everything down.  You’ll have your ideas safely saved away instead of having them lost somewhere in the depths of your mind.  If you don’t write things down you’ll forget many good and some great ideas.” – via The Positivity BlogBe productive while you wait. – “The moment you have to wait for anything, whip that book out and start reading.  Usually you’ll manage quite a few pages while waiting.  Use these pockets of time in your day, and you’ll be amazed at how much time you actually have.  It’s been said that you can get a whole university education just reading one hour a day for five years.  You just have to reclaim those lost minutes.” – via Joyful DaysPut first things first by time boxing your tasks. – “Working on your most important projects first thing in the morning is a classic tip to guarantee that you do meaningful work in your day.  Create a time box to work on your dreams every day, before the world out there has a chance to disrupt your plans.  Time boxing is simply fixing a time period to work on a task or group of tasks.  Instead of working on a task until it’s done, you commit to work on it for a specific amount of time.” via – LitemindUse the right tools. – “It’s easy to be a better housekeeper when you have the right tools.  If your current tools make you work harder or make the task take a long time, consider investing in supplies that will make your life easier.  There are many housekeeping tools available such as multipurpose spray cleaners, lightweight vacuums and steam cleaners, and disinfecting wipes that can be used for more than one task and save you time and money.” –  via Homemaker BarbiAdd value to everything and everyone around you. – If you aren’t adding value, you are wasting everyone’s time, including your own.  “The biggest waste of time and oxygen that you can be is not being a valuable person.  Not valuable to yourself, to your family, to society, and to the planet.” – via Alex ShalmanSpend minutes now to save hours later. – “You have to spend a little time now to save a lot of time later.  It’s the notion of giving some to get some.  This ties into the idea of working smarter not harder.  You can save countless hours over the long-term by spending just a few productive minutes now.” – via Marc and Angel Hack Life  😉 How To Make All The Difference In The World|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/difference-in-the-world.jpg?resize=464%2C245&ssl=1| Every Sunday morning I take a light jog around a park near my home.  There’s a lake located in one corner of the park.  Each time I jog by this lake, I see the same elderly woman sitting at the water’s edge with a small metal cage sitting beside her.This past Sunday my curiosity got the best of me, so I stopped jogging and walked over to her.  As I got closer, I realized that the metal cage was in fact a small trap.  There were three turtles, unharmed, slowly walking around the base of the trap.  She had a fourth turtle in her lap that she was carefully scrubbing with a spongy brush.“Hello,” I said.  “I see you here every Sunday morning.  If you don’t mind my nosiness, I’d love to know what you’re doing with these turtles.”She smiled.  “I’m cleaning off their shells,” she replied.  “Anything on a turtle’s shell, like algae or scum, reduces the turtle’s ability to absorb heat and impedes its ability to swim.  It can also corrode and weaken the shell over time.”“Wow!  That’s really nice of you!” I exclaimed.She went on: “I spend a couple of hours each Sunday morning, relaxing by this lake and helping these little guys out.  It’s my own strange way of making a difference.”“But don’t most freshwater turtles live their whole lives with algae and scum hanging from their shells?” I asked.“Yep, sadly, they do,” she replied.I scratched my head.  “Well then, don’t you think your time could be better spent?  I mean, I think your efforts are kind and all, but there are fresh water turtles living in lakes all around the world.  And 99% of these turtles don’t have kind people like you to help them clean off their shells.  So, no offense… but how exactly are your localized efforts here truly making a difference?”The woman giggled aloud.  She then looked down at the turtle in her lap, scrubbed off the last piece of algae from its shell, and said, “Sweetie, if this little guy could talk, he’d tell you I just made all the difference in the world.”Photo by: Shoebappa An Idle Truth About Our Idols|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/idle-truth-idols.jpg?resize=464%2C301&ssl=1|I met a self-made, multi-millionaire for drinks and dinner last night.  Chris is the owner, CEO and principal engineer for a private software company that nets 20 million dollars a year in profit.  He’s an elite businessman with a big heart.  The compassion and chivalry he shows his employees and clients is unmistakable.  He has been an idol of mine for many years.  And as we sipped wine and chatted, he carried himself with the refined composure and confidence you’d expect from a man of his stature.Then his wife joined us.This was the first time I met Victoria, and she was a bit different than I had envisioned.  She was beautiful, yes, but she complained about everything.  According to her, the waitress was too slow, the centerpiece on the table was ugly, and her brand new Lexus doesn’t drive as smooth as her girlfriends’ Mercedes.Chris grew increasingly irritated with each negative comment that rolled off Victoria’s tongue.  His expression turned sour, his posture deteriorated and his cheeks blushed with frustration.  After just fifteen minutes at the dinner table with her, Chris, the man of power and prestige whom I idolize, had completely lost his poise.   “Where’s the waitress?  This bread is stale.” Victoria huffed under her breath.“The only stale thing I perceive is your incessant bitching!” Chris yelped.  “Will you please stop whining and just allow us to enjoy a pleasant evening for once?  For heaven’s sake!”She gave me a wide-eyed glance, as if to say, “Do you see the crap I have to put up with?”  He gave me a similar look a moment later.  The tension between them stirred my nerves.  I wanted to excuse myself, but I didn’t want to be rude.  Needless to say, the remainder of the evening was rather uncomfortable.My Brain MalfunctionsChris called me this morning and gave me some ingenious advice on how to solve a contractual business dilemma I told him about last night.  He then proceeded to apologize for his behavior at the dinner table.“The work involved in running my business comes naturally to me.  I love what I do.  I’m successful because I understand all the inputs and outputs, and I can precisely tune the production gears to acquire a set of desired results,” Chris said.“Yeah, I’ve seen you in action,” I agreed.He continued: “But when it comes to long-term, intimate relationships, my brain malfunctions… and I inevitably fail.”Multidimensional Human BeingsAll people, even our idols, are multidimensional human beings.  Powerful business men, polished musicians, bestselling authors, and even our own parents all have dimensions of success and dimensions of failure present in their lives.Our successful dimensions usually encompass the things we love most.  We are successful in these dimensions because of our love, because we naturally spend the most time perfecting and nurturing what we love.And this is the part of our lives we want others to see, the successful part that holds our life’s passion.  It’s the notion of putting our best foot forward.  It’s the public persona we envision as our personal legacy:  “The Successful ABC” or “The Award Winning XYZ.”But behind whichever polished storyline we publically promote, there lies a multidimensional human being with a long list of unprofessed failures.  Sometimes this person is a bad husband, or fails to choose a suitable wife.  Sometimes this person laughs at the expense of others.  And sometimes this person takes their eyes off the road and rear-ends the car in front of them.So Do WeThe incident at dinner last night reminded me of this idle truth.Our biggest idols and childhood heroes are just human… with all the flawed dimensions humans have.  And we shouldn’t feel let down when we are faced with the reality of these flaws, because they have always been there.  It’s just part of being human.Sometimes our idols act like obnoxious, emotional, fools.But sometimes so do we.And sometimes they argue, cry, and fall flat on their faces.But sometimes so do we.Photo by: Mike Baird "
"The 3 Pillars of Creativity|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/3-pillars-of-creativity.jpg?resize=260%2C180&ssl=1|Creativity is not just for artists and poets. Everybody has the potential to exercise creativity, to innovate new ways of accomplishing things that will ultimately make life easier and more gratifying. Creativity magnifies the quality and effectiveness of your natural talents, creating an elevated rate of success by injecting a greater sense of passion and fortitude into whatever you do.Happiness is not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort.– Franklin D. RooseveltActs of creativity can be found in every facet of life. We are surrounded by the byproducts of creative ideas, both big and small. And the small acts of creativity are no less important than the big ones. In fact, the more creative you are with the small things in your life, the more creative you will likely be with the big things.Remember, creativity is a mindset, not an accomplishment. The creative mindset is basically an everlasting devotion to approaching various problems and circumstances in innovative ways. Three core traits sit at the foundation of creativity: awareness, confidence and enthusiasm. I consider these to be the three pillars of creativity.AwarenessAwareness is an absolute necessity. Creativity cannot be practically applied until a certain level of fundamental knowledge is gathered about the current situation or problem at hand. Creativity actually relies on both sides of the brain, the creative right side and the logical left side. The first steps the brain takes when tackling a creative venture are actually governed by logic, not creativity. The logical left side of your brain analyzes the situation and all the known facts, defines the problem that must be solved and then hands the data over to the creative right side of your brain. Without this logical information review process, creativity will drown in misdirection.ConfidenceCreative ventures step into the unknown, slowly moving in directions no one has gone before. Any journey into the unknown holds a certain level of inherent risk. Most people are scared to accept this risk, which effectively squashes all their creative ideas before they have a chance to develop them.  Creativity can also be hindered by the frustration of initial failure or third-party ridicule. Confidence is the key. If you have confidence in yourself and your ideas, you will be far more willing to accept calculated risks, take creative chances and thwart off all the other stress factors attempting to restrain your creative edge.EnthusiasmEnthusiasm is the lifeblood of creativity. It is vital because creativity only blossoms when you are passionate and enthusiastic about what you are doing. It’s nearly impossible to pioneer creative solutions for something you have absolutely no interest in. However, when your mind is stimulated by a fundamental curiosity and interest in the subject matter, your creativity will run rampant and your motivation will skyrocket.Conclusion: When the mind is aware of the circumstances, confident in its abilities and enthusiastic about the material, creative ideas may flourish into ground-breaking, sensible solutions. 17 Drug-Free Ways to Stay Awake|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/stay-awake.jpg?resize=225%2C198&ssl=1|Staying awake is easy… 5 shots of espresso and 2 lines of cocaine is all you need.  You’ll certainly be wide awake and wired, but you may also die from a heart attack a few hours later.  In all seriousness, conquering drowsiness before it overwhelms your mind can be quite a challenge without the help of drugs.So the big question is:  What are some healthy, drug-free ways to stay awake when you must?  Let’s take a look at 17 possibilities.Crank Up the AC – Warm, stuffy environments accelerate mental fatigue.  If you need to stay awake in a lecture hall or meeting room find an open seat under an AC vent.Cold Water – Splash some on your face and the pulse area of your wrists.  Drinking an ice-cold glass of water can also help to wake you up, and if you drink enough of it you’ll be up on your feet using the restroom every 30 minutes as well.Fasting at Mealtime – The human body expends a great deal of energy during the digestion process.  This can create a great deal of fatigue when you are trying to stay awake.  Fasting is a great way to avoid this natural fatigue.  As long as you are drinking enough water, fasting for a meal or two is also a healthy way to detoxify your cells and rejuvenate organs.Light Exercise Breaks – Take a break and take a walk or do a couple jumping jacks to get your blood moving.  Even the slightest bit of exercise can act as a healthy way to energize your mind and body.Chew Sugar-Free Peppermint Gum – It won’t rot your teeth and it will generate just enough physical activity to keep you awake.  Strong peppermint flavors seem to work best for me… there’s just something about that refreshing minty taste.Write – The idea is to keep your mind busy.  If you are attending a lecture or business meeting, write down everything that is said.  If you are simply trying to stay awake, create a detailed to-do list for the week or plan out your perfect weekend getaway.A Good Laugh – Watch a funny video clip or read your favorite comic strip.  A good chuckle will stimulate your mind and help you to stay awake a little while longer.Inspirational and Motivational Material – Sometimes all you need is a little pep talk.  Watch a video clip that inspires you.Music – If it’s not too much of a distraction, listening to fast beat music can be a great way to keep your mind awake.Tickle the Top of Your Mouth Cavity – Obviously, you’ll want to do this with your tongue.  Rub your tongue against the top front area of your mouth cavity.  It feels a little weird, but it does give you a quick, irritating nerve jolt that can actually help to keep you awake.Turn On All the Lights – Darkness promotes sleepiness.  Turn on every light in the room.Hangout with a Friend – It’s so much easier to stay awake when you have someone else to interact with.Play Video Games – First-person shooters, fast paced driving games, or online RPGs like the great World of Warcraft are sure to keep you wide awake.Go Outdoors – Getting some fresh air outdoors is always a good way to rouse your senses.Pull Down on Your Earlobes – This may sound strange, but pulling down on your earlobes can help you stay awake and alert when you’re feeling drowsy.  Just try it.Nutritious Low Carb Snacks – Low carb fruits such as raspberries, apples, oranges, and grapefruits are great energy boosters.  Heaping scoops of spicy salsa on a few small crackers is another goodie.  Stay away from meats, breads and dairy products.Get Enough Sleep When You Can – This one should be obvious.  The best way to stay awake is to be well rested.  If you get enough sleep on a regular basis it will be much easier for you to stay awake or pull an all-nighter when you absolutely must.Check out these books for more natural ways to stay awake:365 Energy BoostersThe 150 Most Effective Ways to Boost Your EnergyThe Secrets High-Energy People Use to Beat Emotional Fatigue Black Belts are Simply White Belts Who Didn’t Quit|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/black-belt.jpg?resize=250%2C213&ssl=1|The harsh reality is that most people give-up too early. As soon as the required level of effort intensifies, they throw in the towel and head back to their comfort zone. Figuratively speaking, these people will surely wear a white belt forever. It’s just that simple.Those wearing the black belt never threw in the towel and continue to forge ahead without hesitation. They are constantly training, endlessly learning and always ready for new material. Their success has little to do with intrinsic aptitude and everything to do with psychological determination. They never quit.If you train hard, you’ll not only be hard, you’ll be hard to beat.– Herschel WalkerHere are 9 black belt keys for success.Set Personal Goals – Personal goals define personal success. Success cannot be achieved unless goals have been set ahead of time.Visualize Success – Picture the outcome of your efforts. Use it as motivation to get you there.Work Hard – Be ready to sweat. Success comes at a cost. That cost is hard work.Learn From Your Mistakes – Mistakes are inevitable, and they are also the single greatest element of education.Never Quit – Quitting is failing. Brush yourself off, reevaluate your approach and try again.Keep Training – Self-study is vital. Never stop learning new material and never stop training with the material you already know.Assist Others – You must always give back what you take. Be a student and a teacher. You will learn something new in both roles.Maintain a Relaxed Mind – Relaxation is a critical part of keeping a clear perspective. Even under stressful conditions you must maintain mental equilibrium… breath.Value Your Mentors – A good mentor understands where you’ve been, where you intend to go, and is also chock full of priceless firsthand advice. Respect your mentors and value their opinions. The Simple Art of Being Easy|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/easy-button.jpg?resize=220%2C173&ssl=1|How “easy” are you? Forget the childish definition regarding someone’s willingness to jump into the sack… that’s not the topic here. How easy are you to work with? How easy are you to get a hold of? How easy are you to understand? Do your friends consider you to be “easy”? How about your colleagues or customers?Your ability to be “easy” is the absolute number one key to creating and maintaining successful relationships, both business related and personal. People like things to be easy. If they have to unexpectedly struggle with someone or something, they usually give up without hesitation.Let’s dive a bit deeper into the first 3 questions asked above.How easy are you to work with?Do you listen to other people’s opinions and feedback? Or do you run a “my way or the highway” operation? It’s all about teamwork in life. Your friends, colleagues and customers are part of your team.You all coexist in a massive support system maintained by the natural exchange of giving and taking. The “give and take” exchange involves ideas, goals, advice, products, services, etc. If all you do is take without giving anything back, you will never be easy to work with and you will eventually fail.How easy are you to get a hold of?If people cannot get a hold of you, you are not being easy. Never underestimate the value of keeping an open line of communication. Your general availability and accessibility to others is extremely important to them.When someone calls a friend, colleague or business contact, they have the intention of speaking to this person on the other end of the line. When this person doesn’t answer, it might slightly frustrate them. If this same situation occurs frequently, they may quit calling altogether.How easy are you to understand?It is natural human instinct to be skeptical of the unknown. If you and your product are not easy to understand, you will always be the unknown… And most people will likely keep their distance.The most successful people have the ability to communicate effectively. The most successful products operate as their users expect. Why? Because in both cases they are easy to understand.The Bottom Line: Being “easy” is a big part of being successful. 50 of “The Greatest” Life Has to Offer|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/the-greatest-life-has.jpg?resize=464%2C153&ssl=1|Here’s some positive mental nourishment for you, 50 of “the greatest” you will find on your lifetime drive into the sunset.The Greatest Things – Are not things at all.The Greatest Mystery – Death.The Greatest Gift – Life.The Greatest Work – What you love doing.The Greatest Recreation – Based on the point above: Work.The Greatest Feeling – Happiness.The Greatest Sorrow – A broken heart.The Greatest Sight – A sight imagined, but physically unseen.The Greatest Thought – “I can.”The Greatest Want – Acceptance.The Greatest Need – Awareness.The Greatest Trick – Proving the impossible to be possible.The Greatest Waste – Hatred.The Greatest Asset – Your mind.The Greatest Tool – Your body.The Greatest Smell – A familiar smell.The Greatest Sense – Touch.The Greatest Relationship – Long-term friendship.The Greatest Criminal – A liar.The Greatest Bankruptcy – Lack of confidence.The Greatest Mistake – Quitting.The Greatest Moment – Now.The Greatest Bore – Repetition.The Greatest Manufacturing – Recycling.The Greatest Companion – One you can trust.The Greatest Deception – Self-deception.The Greatest Evil – War.The Greatest Fool – One who thinks he knows it all.The Greatest Sound – Silence.The Greatest Art – Music.The Greatest Love – Thyself.The Greatest People – Family and Friends.The Greatest Conversation – One that inspires action.The Greatest Hero – A teacher.The Greatest Laugh – One that hurts.The Greatest Encounter – A pleasant surprise.The Greatest Story – A true story.The Greatest Communication – Eye contact.The Greatest Wealth – Love.The Greatest Beauty – Is an opinion.The Greatest Compliment – An unexpected one.The Greatest Step – The first step.The Greatest Accomplishment – Finishing what you started.The Greatest Resource – Time.The Greatest Exercise – Sex.The Greatest Service – Helping someone in need.The Greatest Force – Momentum.The Greatest Space – Uncluttered space.The Greatest Expression – A smile.The Greatest Comfort – Familiarity.

"Taking a Vacation Leads to a More Productive Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/vacation.jpg?resize=200%2C258&ssl=1|My buddy Donny is intent on taking a lengthy 6 month vacation to travel around the World… literally.  He has all his destinations mapped out and is currently working on the details of costing.  While his aspiration of conquering the circumference of the globe is a bit extreme, it got me to thinking about the considerable value a long, relaxing vacation adds to our lives.  In a way, it allows us to step outside ourselves, invigorating our minds with fresh ideas and alternative passions.  Sometime’s we lose perspective in the daily grind, completely forgetting who we are outside of the routine.Here are the top 3 reasons why taking a vacation helps you lead a more productive life:A Vacation Revitalizes Your Mind – The demanding events of our weekly routine can wear thin on the livelihood of our psyche.  A worn down psyche means your mind isn’t processing information at its peak capacity.  So, even though you feel busy, you aren’t being as productive as you could be.  Completely removing yourself from the weekly routine by immersing your senses in unfamiliar activities and environments allows the overworked parts of your brain to relax, while simultaneously stimulating the unused corners of your mind.A Vacation Sparks Creative Thought – The redundancy of a weekly routine prevents the mind from stretching its creative thought process beyond the barriers of your typical activities.  Numerous physiologists have proven that taking a step away from your routine actually assists the mind in solving problems that exist within the routine.  In other words, your mind can realize the solutions to various problems when you are not even concentrating on them.  How does this occur?  It has something to do with freeing your mind from the barriers that restrict creative thought, thus allowing you to think more clearly.A Vacation Allows You to Be Yourself – It can be extremely difficult to completely let your guard down when you are caught up in the rapid pace of your weekly routine.  Fear of getting behind schedule, or letting other people trample over you, usually takes precedence over all else.  Thus, a constant tension exists that presses you to maintain a robust image.  This usually prevents you from just being yourself.  Vacations rid you of these external tensions and allow you to act independently of the iconic image you are constantly forced to uphold.  Being yourself may not always be essential to the immediate tasks present in your routine, but it is absolutely vital to your long-term happiness.  In the end, we must accept that our time on this planet is limited.  Regardless of our accomplishments, if we are not content with our existence, we are not leading a productive life. Blog Commenting Hack: Evaluate What IS Written|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/commenting-hack.jpg?resize=248%2C180&ssl=1|I have noticed a trend present in the comments section of blog postings across the blogosphere.  Blog commenters spend a great deal of time discussing what is NOT said, instead of constructively evaluating what IS said.  Based on the paradigm shift that Web 2.0 blogs have on the typical reader/writer roles, the reader gets the chance to be the writer when he/she makes comments on an article, thus the original writer becomes a reader of these comments.  This allows the reader to publicly inject opinion into the original author’s work, a task that comes with a burdening responsibility to maintain the agenda and flow of the article. The reader is basically changing contextual details of the content in a way that alters the direction of the content for other readers.  The reader/commenter must be aware of their core responsibility to maintain article relevance, focusing first on comprehending what IS written before getting excessively outspoken about has NOT yet been addressed.  It is human nature even in spoken conversation to interject with alternative theories before the speaker has a chance to rest the point.  As with spoken conversation, sometimes a reader doesn’t even attempt to relate to the writer’s point of view, but instead funnels the information through his/her own life experiences… thus completely missing the writer’s objective.Certainly there are times when it is important for the reader to interject with alternative information, specifically if he/she feels that the writer is misrepresenting fact or deliberately ignoring crucial details in order to derive a false conclusion.  But it seems to me that quite often supplementary information in blog comments stray away from the writer’s key objective.  Before one introduces supplementary content into the work of another, two questions should be asked: Is this added content relevant to what is already written?  Is the content I am adding purposely excluded from the original article for a creditable reason? A House or A Car… Which Should I Buy First?|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/car-house.jpg?resize=220%2C280&ssl=1|You graduated from college, landed a good job, and have been diligently saving money for awhile now.  Your car is getting old and pretty soon you are going to need a new one, but you also have the desire to be a homeowner.  Should you buy a new house or a new car first?  This question is actually extremely difficult to answer.  It truly depends on the immediate financial circumstances of the individual involved.Before thinking about it, most people would probably advise buying a house before buying a car.  After all, a house is an appreciating asset and a car is a depreciating liability, right?  That statement might be true in the long term, but in reality, most working professionals will eventually buy both a house and a car.  In the end you will have the money for both.  So it’s not really an issue of which is the better long term investment, it’s a question of which one should be purchased first.I’m going to assume the following:You have about $40K saved in cash.Your current car is old and only worth about $1,500.You want to avoid financing a car.You live in a rental property.You are looking to purchase a new car under $25KYou will be a first time home buyerYou are looking to purchase a house for about $275K with at least a 10% down payment and 5K in closing costs.Answering the following questions will assist you in making the right decision based on your own individual situation.How long will your current car last?Have a decent mechanic estimate your car’s life expectancy.  Are there any cheap repairs that could increase the life expectancy?  Are the repairs worth the money based on the car’s overall worth?Will your overall living expenses be cheaper before or after you purchase a house?Is the total cost of your current rent and utilities significantly cheaper than the cost of a mortgage, utilities, homeowner’s taxes, and insurance?  In other words, which living arrangement allows you to save cash the quickest?If you buy a house first, how long will it take you to save enough cash in order to purchase a car outright?  How much money can you comfortably afford to save each month?Likewise, if you buy a car first, how long will it take you to replace the cash necessary for a down payment on a house?  How much money can you comfortably afford to save each month?Do you expect decent short-term real estate appreciation in the housing market you intend to buy into?  Ask a real estate agent for numbers on local market trends.  Have home prices been rising or sinking?  What do the overall unsold inventory numbers look like?  In other words, is there any foreseen disadvantage to holding off on a house purchase for a year?Consider the following scenario:You really want a new house, so you decide to deal with your old car’s problems and instead purchase a new house first.  Now you have zero cash, but you do have a slowly appreciating asset, a beautiful new home.  6 months later your old car completely breaks down and the repair costs are close to the total value of the car.  If the car isn’t worth the money, you will have no choice but to finance a new car.  You will now be paying interest on an auto loan in addition to paying your monthly mortgage payments.  The annual appreciation of your house is counterbalanced by the finance charges you are paying on your car loan… at least for the first couple of years.  In the end was it really smarter to purchase the house first?The bottom line:  As I stated earlier, most people assume that buying a house first is the smarter choice.  While it very well could be, it isn’t necessarily the best order of operations for everyone.  It completely depends on individual circumstance.  Thank God it’s Friday… Oh God it’s Monday|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/monday-friday.jpg?resize=232%2C184&ssl=1|I heard someone mutter the latter yesterday morning and it got me to thinking…  Does the general popularity of these phrases have anything to do with a society-wide deficiency of aspirations and lack of motivation?  Each phrase by itself seems innocent enough, but when placed next to one another it draws a bigger, darker picture depicting an endless cycle of empty progress.Are we just wishing life away?  Nothing groundbreaking usually happens on the weekend that ultimately changes the order of the following week.  It makes more sense to live life between the lines of Monday and Friday by accepting things the way that they are, but simultaneously making proactive steps forward.  It is about not getting completely hung up on the past or the future, but dealing with the present situation in a way that moves you closer to your ideals.  Although, I suppose that would take a lot of self discipline. When Buying a Car with a Credit Card Makes Cents|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/new-car.jpg?resize=250%2C183&ssl=1|We just purchased a brand new car (Honda Accord Coupe EX-L) on a credit card.  You think we’re crazy?  Think again.  We instantly saved ourselves about $500 by paying with plastic.  Sure, there are a million reasons why this might sound like a bad idea in regards to long term debt.  However, if you have the cash to back it up, a credit card is the smart way to pay for a new car.Consider the following 2 points:Rewards / Miles Credit Cards – Typical rewards cards generally earn the consumer somewhere in the ballpark of 2% cash back.  If you buy a new car for $25,000 with your rewards credit card, you just saved yourself $500.  If you have an airline miles rewards card, as I do (Southwest Visa), you can earn yourself a free round trip flight for about $20,000 in purchases.  With airline fares continuously skyrocketing, this round trip airfare ticket is easily worth about $500.0% Interest Rate – Many credit card issuers entice potential consumers with various introductory 0% interest rate deals for a certain period of time.  This introductory rate period usually spans somewhere between 6 months and 1 year.  Let’s say you buy a $25,000 car on your 0% interest for 1 year credit card.  You then invest the $25,000 in a 1 year CD (a non-liquid investment that prevents you from spending the cash) earning a modest 5%.  At the end of 1 year you have $26,250.  You immediately pay off the $25,000 car, leaving $1,250 to be returned to hip national bank. Do you think those savings are meager, or not worth the effort?  Well then head over to your bank right now and donate that amount of money into a complete stranger’s bank account.  No?  I didn’t think so.  The bottom line is this:  If you have the cash and discipline necessary to back up your car purchase, there is no reason why you shouldn’t reap the benefits of buying your next car with a credit card.  You do the math.  It just makes cents.PS: Contrary to popular belief, most new car dealers will let you put a hefty dollar sum of your car purchase on a credit card, so long as your are paying cash on the remaining balance.

"8 Popular Contradictions People Make In Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/contradictions-in-life.jpg?resize=234%2C182&ssl=1|I received an email yesterday asking for an accurate costing estimate pertaining to the specifics of a work contract I am managing.  After robotically shifting numbers around for a few minutes it suddenly occurred to me that formulating an accurate estimate is actually impossible.  Think about it… an accurate estimate?  Isn’t that a bit of a contradiction?This got me thinking about all the other contradictions I’ve recently observed in life.  The more I think about it, the more I recognize a subtle pattern of truth.  Our lives are filled with contradiction.  From our goals and aspirations to our moral values and beliefs, contradiction is everywhere.By concentrating my attention specifically on the immediate people around me, I quickly came up with the following list of visible contradictions.  My guess is that these are popular contradictions found in the lives of many people.  If one were to pay close attention for long enough, I bet the list of life’s popular contradictions would be quite extensive.People download thousands of dollars worth of pirated software and media over the Internet, but they would never steal from a brick and mortar shopping mall.Most people say they appreciate the importance of a balanced life, but dedicate 75% of their life to work and an additional 10% to watching T.V.People candidly deny the possibility of gods outside of their own belief system, yet become very defensive when someone reciprocates that point of view.In general, many respectful law abiding citizens have also received numerous speeding fines and they never alter their driving habits.Many people do their part to save the environment with the overarching goal of making the world a better place for their children.  Some of these same people also support abortion.Many people living in overly populated urban areas say they are in full support of going Green.It’s common to hear people complain about the lack of a diverse perspective in mass media news reports, yet the average American supports censorship.So many of us complain about the boring cycle of repetition present in our weekly routines, yet we choose no clear course for correction.  We talk, but we don’t walk. Made Me Laugh Out Loud|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/men-have-it-bad.jpg?resize=318%2C588&ssl=1|These two graphics made me laugh out loud… literally!  🙂  I hope that they will bring a smile to your face as well… Before Forgiving Someone, Consider These 10 Points|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/forgiveness.jpg?resize=230%2C208&ssl=1|Being violated, either physically or emotionally, by a friend or family member is one of the most agonizing occurrences in life.  A series of questions ultimately arise in the aftermath.  When a trusted third party consciously dishonors you, should you forgive them?  How and when do you forgive them?  Where exactly should you draw the line of no forgiveness?The volatility of subjective circumstance varies greatly between different individual incidents.  Based on the situational level of variance, there is no universally accurate answer to those questions.  However, there are explicitly defined points in the form of 10 simple words that someone should mindfully evaluate when contemplating the rationale behind forgiveness.  One must remember not to concentrate solely on the negative act, but also on the actions that followed the act.Ask yourself: In what manner were these 10 points affected?Family – A direct link to your past and the people most likely stick by your side.  Was your family wrongfully implicated, attacked, or used against you in any way?Money – Commonly regarded as one of the most essential elements of personal livelihood.  Was money involved, either directly, or through the exploitation of a lawsuit?  Were there any detrimental long term effects?Love – One of the strongest emotional feelings a person can possess.  Were emotional feelings on par with love shattered in any way?  Who was affected?  Was it based on the direct actions of someone else?   Are the effects permanent?Respect – The integrity of principal and quite possibly the foundation for which all relationships are built upon.  Was there a failure to meet agreed upon expectations?  Did certain actions depict a lack of moral values?  In was way did respect, or lack thereof, play a roll?Trust – An assumed relationship of reliance usually based on past experience.  Honesty, good character, and competence usually build the bond of trust over time.  Was your assumed trust in someone else purposely used against you?  Could you ever trust them again? Friendship – A bond created by feelings of regard and loyalty to others.  Were attacks made that resulted in the disruption of friendship between you and a third party?  Was loyalty dropped just to benefit the casual needs of the other person? History – The past times gone by that have taken you to the present moment.  How deeply embedded in your past is this person?  If they died tomorrow, what would you remember most about them?Betrayal – A form of direct deception going against presumed trust and confidence in an individual.  How exactly were you betrayed?  Was this a clear account of genuine betrayal or was it merely a perceived betrayal from your point of view?  What is the general consensus of third party opinion?  Is there another side to the story that should be heard?Intensions – Decided upon actions that lead to a specific purpose.  What were the primary intentions of the other person when they betrayed you?  Were you directly connected to the outcome their intentions?  What are there intentions now?Instinct – An inherent perception of something; your gut feeling.  What do your instincts tell you about the situation and about the person… both in the past, present, and future?PS: I figured I’d give a little background info on what provoked me to write about the topic of forgiveness. Angel and I were recently contacted by an old friend from college.  We haven’t spoken to this person since July of 2004.  She was a member of a tight knit group of friends that we met our freshman year.  Everyone in this group knew each other from high school, so initially Angel and I were the outsiders.  We met the group when I randomly moved into a freshman college dorm/apartment with a couple of them.  We hit it off, and ended up living together for the entire duration of our college careers.  Needless to say we spent a lot of time together and regarded them as good friends. A fallout in our relationship occurred when feelings were hurt based on intimate involvement between Angel’s sister and one of the guys in the group.  The situation was handled immaturely at both ends.  We could have easily rectified our issues in a short period of time.  However,  the conclusion of college provoked them to relocate, which complicated our line of communication.  They then quickly started a legal battle over the condition of the rental property in which we had lived for several years.  They basically took no responsibility for wear and tear on the property.  Due to the complexity of the situation, the bill got stuck on my lap.  I felt as if I had been collectively stabbed in the back by an entire group of my friends.  After 4 years of solid friendship, we never spoke to them again… until we received the recent email. 10 Things We All Celebrate Subconsciously|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/subconscious-celebration.jpg?ssl=1|There are certain intricacies in life that we all repeatedly and unintentionally celebrate on a regular basis. These celebrated incidents are composed of the smaller things in life, those seemingly inconsequential events that instantly place us in a better mood. If you think about it hard enough, I’ll bet that you have taken part in each one of the following acts of subconscious celebration:Making the Yellow Light – It’s one of those simple pleasures, the act of beating the pack. As you blaze through the yellow light you glance in your rearview to see all the cars behind you stopping at the red light. You made it! Hoorah… You will now arrive at your destination 1 minute sooner! For some reason it just makes you glow inside. Life seems great in that moment of celebration.Lunch Time – “Yes… its Lunch time!” It happens every weekday at the same time with the same crowd. You know exactly what to expect and yet you celebrate its arrival with eager enthusiasm. That turkey sandwich tastes better at noon on an idle Tuesday than it would in any other setting, under any other circumstances.Friday Afternoon – Okay, so you probably consider this to be a bit more of a full blown conscious celebration, but it actually does creep up slowly in the subconscious. It starts on Friday afternoon around lunch time. Productivity gradually slows down over the course of a couple hours, and then by 3PM it hits a brick wall. Pretty soon you’re happily chatting away with colleagues that you deliberately avoided all week long. But that’s okay, because you can almost taste the 48 hours of freedom that lay ahead.The First Sip – …of a beer or mixed drink that is! As long as you are not an addict, there is nothing wrong with having a couple alcoholic beverages in your off-time. And when the events leading up to this breath of freedom are hectic, that first sip is sheer bliss!Music – There is no better feeling than hearing the right song at the right time. It doesn’t matter what the setting is, hearing the right song in that moment is one of those simple pleasures in life that instantly lifts your spirits. You could be driving home from work, hanging out at a bar with friends, or jogging. When the right song for that moment rattles your ear drums the entire meaning of life momentarily makes complete sense.Post-Workout – Regardless of your fitness level or fitness goals, I have no doubt that you subconsciously celebrate the completion of a solid workout. It’s a giddy feeling of self accomplishment; the one true activity (without taking hallucinogens) that actually makes you feel better and look better simultaneously. When you walk out the front door of the gym you are on top of the world.Getting Things Done – Getting a task completed, no matter how big or small, is a conscious endeavor that usually brings you closer to some outstanding objective. However, this endeavor comes with a huge bonus! The bonus comes in the form of a warm subconscious feeling of accomplishment. Getting something done is like hitting 2 birds with one stone… the most important usually being the feeling of self accomplishment.Sleeping In – Whether you can admit it or not, sleeping in is a celebration of vast proportions. People usually feel guilty for sleeping in because they think they should be out conquering some vital chore. But, you know what? Sometimes it just makes sense to stop and relax. And there is no better feeling of relaxation than sleeping until your eyes just pop open on their own.Friendship – Friendship is something we persistently celebrate, yet somehow fail to consciously appreciate. How does this make sense? Quite simply, we are always in a rush to socialize, and we celebrate the act of doing so, yet we are not necessarily conscious of its fundamental importance. Friendship is always celebrated; consciously when we are aware of its importance, and subconsciously when we are not.Telling a Story – One of the most exciting gifts in life is that of a new experience. One of the most enticing roles we all lead in life is that of the storyteller. What good is a new experience if we cannot share the story with others? We are consciously aware of our new experiences, but that’s only half of the thrill. Subconsciously, we can’t wait to tell everyone we know. The Only 7 Things Yahoo Does Better than Google|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/yahoo-vs-google.jpg?resize=149%2C184&ssl=1|Let me start this off by stating that I am a long time Google power user.  Google handles all of my daily web searching, email, chat, RSS feeds, blog monetization, etc.  In my opinion, it blows Yahoo (and most other Internet companies) clear out of the water.  However, there are a select few services that I regularly turn to Yahoo for.  Why?  It’s either because Yahoo does it better, or because Google doesn’t offer it.Here are the only 7 things Yahoo does better than Google:Personal Finance – Yahoo Finance contains a great wealth of original content that easily rivals some of the biggest financial sites in the game (CNN Money, TheStreet.com, etc.).  The interface is equally intuitive and accessible to both new investors and longtime financial gurus.  Google Finance is coming along, but it isn’t quite up to par just yet.Answers to Questions – Yahoo Answers allows users to ask questions or answer other user’s questions; A simple concept that works well for Yahoo.  Google has no such active service.  The closest competition on the web right now is Ask MetaFilter… also a great question/answer service.Website Backlink Info – Most webmasters like to know exactly how many sites are linking to their various websites.  Yahoo makes this especially easy with their “linkdomain:” search operator.  It quickly provides a full list of incoming links to any given domain.  For some reason Google does not publicly disclose this backlink information, but instead provides a small sample of quality incoming links to a given domain via it’s “link:” search operator.  Google does provide Google Webmaster Tools that will give you backlink information for a specific domain once you sign up and prove to Google that you are the owner of the domain.Image Hosting and Sharing – With its recent purchase of Flickr, Yahoo now rules the Web 2.0 photo sharing market.  Flickr is currently the king over all the other photo sharing sites out there.  Although, lets not forget that Google rules the Web 2.0 video sharing market with YouTube.Local Search – If you are looking for businesses around your town or city, Yahoo Local is a step ahead of Google.  While Google can perform local searches in a variety of different ways through their standard search interface and Google Maps application, Yahoo Local is a more polished service that puts all local search capabilities on one convenient page.  Yahoo local is sort of like a digital Yellow/White Pages.Entertainment Portal – From music to online games to sports, Yahoo provides a solid entertainment web portal capable of satisfying various entertainment and leisure user demographics.  For better or for worst, Google isn’t trying to be an entertainment portal, so it doesn’t even come close to competing with Yahoo in this regard.Privacy Policy – Yahoo is arguably better with the privacy concerns of its users.  Certainly this point could be debated in favor of either company, but there seems to be more public controversy surrounding Google’s privacy policies.  Like most, I suck it up and use Google’s services anyway.  I do, however, have a Yahoo Mail account that I use to communicate with other bloggers concerning blog monetization strategies that may include Google’s Adwords service.  I figure, why let Google have access to that info too?So what does Google do better than Yahoo?  Well, that’s easy… every conceivable task other than the 7 points listed above.  Of course, that’s just my opinion…  😉 "
"What is Morality? Fact or Opinion?|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/what-is-morality.jpg?resize=200%2C202&ssl=1|What does it mean to be moral?  The topic of morality can easily be dissected from multiple view points among compassionate people of similar societal backgrounds.  Once the variables of divergent culture, religion, and personal circumstance get tossed into the equation the analysis of moral rights and wrongs will produce an infinite list of possible values.  Every moral value will be true in the eye of the beholder, but may be completely incongruent to that of the next contestant.So who is right?  They all are.  None of them are.  The key is to realize that there is no universally right moral value system.  Broken down to the most basic constructs, morality is simply the system by which living beings treat one another.  Moral beings hold a sense of empathy and consideration toward others, thus forming more successful and steadfast societies with vigorous rates of reproduction and growth. Any explanation more complex than this tends to be instilled with ideas of universal morality containing bold judgments on absolute moral rights and wrongs.  These so called universal moral standards usually incorporate numerous baseless declarations often used by organized social circles as justification for whatever agenda they are endorsing at the time.  Outside of a general compassion for fellow peers, moral values are based entirely on opinion.Of course… this is just my opinion, and that’s a fact.  😉 11 Practical Ways to Spend Your Money|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/practical-money.jpg?resize=175%2C208&ssl=1|I know, I know.  Saving and investing your money for the future is one of the most practical things you can do.  This is solid advice, but when you do decide to spend your hard earned money it should be spent on something practical, useful, and meaningful to the wellbeing of your existence.  So many people either save their money or blow it on worthless crap.  Here are 11 practical ways to spend your money on something useful:Travel to See the Significant People in Your Life – There may be no better way to spend your money than to use it to nurture and rekindle personal relationships with the most significant people in your life.  As time quickly passes, we sometimes forget how essential strong personal relationships are to our mental wellbeing.  The older we get the more we need true friends and family to be regular parts of our lives.Hire a Personal Trainer – Your health is your life. Without it, all the success and affluence in the world is meaningless.  Committing yourself to a regular exercise routine is one of the best ways to maintain the health of your body and mind.  Sometimes it’s hard to tackle this endeavor on your own.  Spending money on a knowledgeable personal trainer who can set you on the right course creates priceless results.  Make sure you stick with the trainer until you are committed to exercising on your own.Fix What Is Broken – Have you been ignoring your screeching brakes?  What about the excessively loud hum from your AC compressor?  Or the scratching noise coming from your computer system?  Sooner or later these small annoyances will wear down the reliability of the product and you will be left with a completely broken product instead of just a halfway broken one.  Use your money wisely to fix and maintain your belongings.Educate Yourself – Use your money to purchase educational courses or books pertaining to your career, or to a miscellaneous topic that interests and intrigues you.  Remember, knowledge is power and your brain is the container of that knowledge.  There are few options for spending money on something more practical than the development and facility of your brain.Add Value to Your Home – Your home should be your sanctuary, the place on this planet where you feel the most comfortable.  Adding value to your home, be it personal value or increased monetary value, is always a practical choice for spending your money.  If the additions you make increase your level of comfort for years to come, you win.  If they increase the value of the home to a third party someday when you sell, you win.  If both occur, you win big.Take a Healthy, Relaxing Vacation – A vacation revitalizes your mind by pulling you away from the daily stress factors in your life.  It can spark creative thought by stimulating your brain with new material.  And finally, a vacation allows you to be yourself without the external influences present in your typical surroundings.  Does that sound like something worth spending money on?  It should.Upgrade Something You Use Regularly – There is nothing wrong with splurging on a practical item that you actually use on a regular basis.  If you are a hardcore movie buff that loves to watch movies on Saturday nights with your family and friends, having a 65 inch HDTV and a Blue-ray player makes sense.  If you love computer games, purchasing a powerhouse laptop gaming rig makes sense.  The idea is to never waste money on stuff you don’t use.  Spending money on upgrading your hobbies is one of the reasons you work so hard in the first place.Buy Meaningful Gifts for Key People in Your Life – One of the most rewarding acts in life is the act of giving; especially to those key people you truly care about the most.  Spend a little money every now and then on a sensible gift for some of the key people in your life.  Surprise them.  It doesn’t have to be their birthday or a holiday.  Remember, there is no better gift than an unexpected gift.  You will make them feel special.  For instance, my buddy Donny brought me back a cool souvenir from Amsterdam a few months back and it just made me feel good.Update Your Wardrobe – You don’t have to waste money on the latest overpriced fashion line to look good.  However, if you are still wearing the same ratty shirts, slacks and shoes from 5 years ago, it might be time to go shopping.  While appearance isn’t everything, it can make you look older, smarter and more emotionally mature.  First impressions for job interviews, dates, and the like are heavily weighted on the way you look.  Sometimes it is practical to dress to impress.Buy Healthier Food – “You are what you eat.”  There is a great deal of truth in that statement.  It is impossible to maintain a healthy body and mind if you pump your body full of junk food.  Fresh, healthy food is usually more expensive, but this is an expense with priceless benefits to the longevity and wellbeing of your future.  Eating healthy goes right along with bullet number 2 about hiring a personal trainer.  Your health is your life.Pay Down Debt – This one is a no brainer, so I just couldn’t bring myself to leave it off the list.  If you have a great deal of high interest debt it would be foolish not to pay it down before you go off and splurge on additional purchases.  There is nothing less practical than being a slave to your debts. 10 Handy Numbers to Save in Your Mobile Phone|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/10-handy-numbers.jpg?resize=240%2C152&ssl=1|“Always be prepared!”  That’s the Boy Scout motto.  Here are 10 phone numbers we could not care less about until the moment we need them, at which point they save us time, money and general peace of mind.  Do yourself a favor and take 10 minutes to program each of these handy numbers into your mobile phone.  I promise you, the convenience you will gain from it someday is priceless.1.  Lost or Stolen Credit Card Hotline – Sure, the number for your credit card issuer is conveniently located on the back of your credit card… that is until the card gets lost or stolen.  It’s nice to be able to cancel a credit card the minute you realize it’s missing.  That way you can solve the problem before it starts by avoiding the need to deal with expunging malicious charges.Visa: 1-800-VISA-911 (1-800-847-2911)MasterCard: 1-800-MC-ASSIST (800-622-7747)American Express: 1-800-992-3404Discover: 1-800-DISCOVER (1-800-347-2683)Diners Club: 1-800-2DINERS (1-800-234-6377)2.  Car Insurance Claims Hotline – Pretty much the first number you should call when you get in a car accident.  Or the second number if the accident was severe, just after calling 911.  Here are a few of the major provider’s claims department numbers:Geico: 1-800-861-8380Allstate: 1-800-ALLSTATE (1-800-255-7828)Nationwide: 1-800-421-3535Progressive: 1-800-PROGRESSIVE (1-800-776-4737)Liberty Mutual: 1-800-2CLAIMS (1-800-225-2467)State Farm: Depends where you live (find your agent’s number).AIG Direct: 1-888-244-6163Travelers: 1-800-CLAIM33 (1-800-252-4633)3.  Health Insurance Provider – Should tragedy strike and you find yourself headed to the emergency room for medical care, you will want to be sure that your medical bills are covered by your health insurance provider.  Have someone make a quick call to your provider to make sure you’re approved for full coverage. It’s certainly more productive and a lot cheaper to address this before the medical care, unless of course you enjoy paying for medical bills out of your own pocket.  Find your provider’s number on your health insurance card and program it into your phone as ‘Health Insurance’.4.  Free 411 From Anywhere – It’s always nice to have the ability to find a phone number or address to a specific business of interest when you are on the road.  If you don’t have an internet ready mobile phone 1-800-GOOG-411 is you next best bet.  It’s Google’s free nationwide 411 information hotline and it beats the heck out of paying your mobile service provider 75 cents for their sub-par directory assistance.5.  Local Locksmith – There’s nothing worse than being locked out, especially at night.  Save yourself the hassle of trying to find a reputable locksmith with reasonable prices when you are locked out and stressed out.  Do a little homework now and find yourself a reputable locksmith that has a 24 hour emergency call service.  Find a local locksmith on YellowPages.com.6.  A Friendly Colleague’s Direct Line – You can use this person as a messenger to pass an important piece of information on to your manager or someone else at the office when you are on the road.  Or you can call them if you accidently left an important phone number or piece of information behind at the office.  Tell this person that you would be happy to return the favor anytime.7.  Local Towing Service or AAA – When your car breaks down in an inconvenient location this number will make your life a lot easier.  The company with the largest geographic service area is always your best bet.  Find a local towing service on YellowPages.com.  If you have AAA, congrats for being wise.8.  Home or Work Entry – You should always have an entry for Home and/or Work in your mobile phones.  Each entry should point to your direct corresponding number at each location.  These entries are not there to help you call your home or your work.  They are there just incase you lose your phone and someone with a little honesty and compassion finds it.  It gives this person an easy way of getting in touch with you.9.  Primary Care Physician – If you are on the road or out of town and a non-emergency medical issue arises, it’s always nice to be able to run the information past your primary care physician or one of his/her nurses.  After all, this is the medical team that has familiarity with all your recent personal medical history.  They may be able to give you more insight into your problem by weighing your symptoms against your historical medical files and profile.10.  Airlines Reservations Hotline – Obviously this one helps out more when you’re traveling, but believe me someday it will come in handy.  When you’re on a trip far away from home and your rental car gets a flat tire on the way to the airport, or your luggage is lost, or you are running late and need to check your flight status… these are times when having your Airlines on speed dial saves you some serious peace of mind.  Airlines reservation hotlines usually bring you directly to a human being, so it’s a good number to use to get a hold of someone that can transfer you in the right direction if necessary.  Here are the phone numbers to some of the major carriers:American Airlines: 1-800-433-7300Continental: 1-800-525-0280Delta

your imagination?  As we grow up we tend to lose track of our ability to dream without reason.  If we do not dream we will never see beyond today’s reality.  It is our imagination that drives both our dreams and our curiosity to chase them.Maturity is a natural, essential evolution in one’s life.  As we mature we become more educated, organized, responsible, and serious.  General personal progression seems to be the obvious trend during this cycle, but our ability to let our imagination run free is lost somewhere between 9 and 5.  It seems that the more we learn here, the more we forget there.We should never stop learning, but we should also never stop dreaming.  What good is educated progression if we lose sight of our natural human instinct to imagine, or to chase this imagination equipped with nothing more than a stick.  You had zero to lose then and you have zero to lose now.  Life is short.  Have fun.  Don’t forget to dream.  Don’t forget to use your imagination.

"Popular Infidelity: We Are All To Blame|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/moment-infidelity.jpg?resize=245%2C200&ssl=1|Sexual infidelity is widely regarded as one of the most dishonorable assaults against the sanctity of an intimate relationship.  Yet, we all seem to be mesmerized by it.  Infidelity makes a love story more intense, a song or poem more passionately tragic, and forms the foundation for which the immensely popular celebrity gossip industry firmly holds the attention of millions worldwide.  If infidelity is so appalling, then why are we all so consumed with the notions of the act?At some point in time everyone involved in an exclusive relationship experiences a momentary thought of infidelity.  It’s the flirtatious glimmer in your eye that indicates a brief superficial curiosity for someone of the opposite sex, the simple act of wondering.  For that split second your values misalign, placing shallow emotion ahead of your true moral character.  This momentary shift is a direct reflection of your instinctual emotion splitting away from your moral values.  When your sound moral values and your fickle emotion are disconnected, your mind is divided and thus your judgment is muddled.  Most people’s acts of infidelity are innocent, left hanging to expire in brief, insignificant moments of thought.It is the strength of our character that realigns this momentary disconnect and prevents innocent thought from transgressing into an act of infidelity.  Reliability, honesty, and trustworthiness can be directly measured by one’s strength of character.  When the act of infidelity occurs, it has nothing to do with love; it is solely related to the shameful weakness of one’s character… weakness that is driven by senseless emotion.People whom have never actually taken part in the act of infidelity would probably also deny the allegation of ever experiencing a momentary thought of infidelity.  This can be attributed to the fact that the thought never actually enters the conscious mind, but instead lingers in our subconscious.  The thought process is a natural instinct, and although we may be oblivious to it, our minds are instinctually aware of it.  It’s the combination of this subconscious awareness and our general human curiosity that will continue to foster the mass market interest and popularity of infidelity.I’ll wrap it up with a quote from one of my favorite artists:Everyone here is wondering what it’s like to be with somebody else.Everyone here’s to blame, everyone here,Gets caught up in the pleasure of the pain.Everyone hides shades of shame,But looking inside we’re the same, we’re all the same.And we’re all grown now, but we don’t know howto get it back to good.– Rob Thomas 10 Irrational Thoughts Rational People Often Think|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/girl_thinking.jpg?resize=225%2C211&ssl=1|Irrational thoughts occasionally occur in the minds of all people.  Intelligence does not make someone immune to irrational thought.  These thoughts typically clutter our minds with feelings of resentment and distaste.  Sometimes they are based on internal defense mechanisms we develop to mitigate personal anger in an attempt to avoid facing the truth about ourselves or our immediate circumstances.  If someone imposes stringent expectations related to a stressful issue on themselves or their close companions, irrational thought is likely to set in, and all parties involved will probably experience needless emotional grief.Passionate perceptions of an event made by someone in distress can seem crazy from a third party perspective.  This craziness is simply the sum of stress and irrational thought.  These thoughts allow the distressed party to remain the victim while avoiding all situational responsibility.  One must learn to break this momentary negative thought process in order to achieve continuous stability in their life and in their relationships.Here are 10 irrational thoughts that rational people often fall victim to at one point or another:Mistakes are never acceptable.  If I make one, it means that I am incompetent.When somebody disagrees with me, it is a personal attack against me.To be content in life, I must be liked by all people.My true value as an individual depends on what others think of me.If I am not involved in an intimate relationship, I am completely alone.There is no grey area.  Success is black and failure is white.Nothing ever turns out the way you want it to.If the outcome was not perfect, it was a complete failure.I am in absolute control of my life.  If something bad happens, it is my fault.The past always repeats itself.  If it was true then, it must be true now.Your life will be more productive if you learn to avoid this type of negative thinking.Check out these books for more insight on irrational thoughts:Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our DecisionsSway: The Irresistible Pull of Irrational BehaviorMistakes Were Made (But Not by Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts 3 Reasons to Quit Your Job in order to Advance Your Career|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/personal-growth.jpg?resize=290%2C231&ssl=1|A routine personal assessment of your career goals and career path directly correlates to a successful and rewarding profession in corporate America.  One must continually learn, adapt, network, evolve and progress.  Once this cycle begins to stagnate, changes must be made to ensure continual knowledge development and job advancement.  Since higher salaries are usually tied to advanced job positions, maintaining this cycle is essential in a person’s ability to increase their income producing power.Daily Blog Tips posted an article entitled “7 Reasons to Quit Your Job” a few months back.  The article discusses 7 reasons why someone should quit their job in an effort to pursuit alternative career advancement.  While the article is well written and passionate, it is also completely one dimensional based on the “work for yourself” viewpoint the author takes.  The points made are valid, but let’s face it, not everyone wants to go into business for themselves.  Some people are content with the corporate America exchange of hours for dollars.Self employment is only one of many possible courses for career progression.  Thus, there are many other reasons to reevaluate your current job in a proactive effort to realign your career goals.  After a thorough assessment of your current job position and your future career ambitions, here are 3 general reasons why you should quit your job:You Dislike Your Job – No matter how much you get paid or how elite your job title is, the ultimate question is, are you happy?  A good majority of our waking hours are spent working.  Life seems a bit of a waste if you don’t enjoy that time.You Are Not Learning – If you aren’t continually expanding your skill set and adapting to new technologies and processes, you will become an undesirable candidate for advanced job placement in the eyes of all employers.  Never forget the old adage, knowledge is power.  Your career progression relies heavily on your ability to master new skills.You Are Pigeonholed – If your employer classifies or categorizes you in a way that inhibits your ability to grow, it’s time to take immediate action.  Pigeonholing means that your employer has set up boundaries around you.  These boundaries restrain you from moving around within the company.  Usually motivated by the inaccurate perception management has concerning an employee, these perceptions are usually all that matters when promotion time comes around.  Are potential career opportunities with your current employer passing right over you?  Are you being skipped over on positions you want to be a part of?You are the only person that cares about your personal growth.  It’s up to you, and only you, to make it happen.  Be crystal clear on your personal goals for growth and be aware of how that growth fits into your employer’s objectives.  Make sure you professionally convey these goals to the right people.  Managing personal career growth is a continual proactive process of re-evaluating your goals and suitably aligning them to the goals of your employer.  If you aren’t being proactive, you are being reactive, and you will be unprepared to take action when career growth opportunities arise.  If you have been diligent and your current employer still resists your motivation… it’s time to move on. 5 Healthy Habits of a Productive Lifestyle|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/healthy-apple.jpg?resize=240%2C180&ssl=1|My parents are health nuts.  They are two loving, caring parents, but they are constantly in the process of reminding me how to maintain a healthy diet, mindset, and lifestyle.  Over the years they have mailed me numerous health related pamphlets, articles, and quick-lists.  Even though much of the information seems redundant, I usually read through it all anyway.So here is my attempt to simplify the information that every general health article ever written states by delivering the info in 5 clear bullet points:Eat Nutritious Food – Most of us know what is and is not nutritious for our bodies.  We also know that what tastes good is not always what we should be stuffing our faces with.  The old adage “you are what you eat” could not be any closer to the truth.  If you ignore this step, the rest of the steps on this list will be a waste of your time.Exercise Regularly – Most health professionals seem to think that about 30 minutes of exercise everyday is enough to fulfill this requirement.  The #1 suggested form of exercise is a 30 minute brisk walk outdoors.Do Not Smoke – This should be obvious, yet 1 out of every 5 people still smokes cigarettes on a regular basis.  Don’t smoke, and avoid being around smokers while they smoke.Nurture Your Relationships – Personal relationships are essential to general contentment and satisfaction in life.  Regular interaction with close friends and family is regarded by many mental health professionals as the #1 source of happiness in a human being’s life.Manage Stress – Stress comes in many forms, so make sure you are aware of any personal stress factors that are sitting in the back of your mind.  Don’t put off a task that is stressing you out.  Instead, address the problem head on and resolve it ASAP. 7 Google Searches I Wish I Could Take Back|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/mag-glass.jpg?resize=291%2C200&ssl=1|Google Web History has been around for about a month now, and what a fantastic tool it is!  Fantastic… until you start combing through your search history and realize you wish you didn’t make some of those search queries after all.  Even more so, you wish Google didn’t catalog every move you made so that your significant other could use it for her personal viewing pleasure.  But I guess we’d rather have Google catalog it instead of Big Brother… or is Google Big Brother?  Just kiddin’!I installed the Google Toolbar last month on one of my machines and didn’t realize that Google’s Web History was activated by default.  Angel and I had fun (or not) looking through some of the search queries I made over this month-long period.  I had a tough time explaining the motivation behind a few of them. 😉  Some were a little scary and others were downright hilarious, but one point became clear: If you’re not careful, Google will know every move you make on the web… the good, the bad, and the ugly.Here are 7 Google searches that I made last month and wish I could take back:Funny/Scary – filetype:txt “windows XP” +cdkey – No Mr. Gates, it’s not what it looks like.Scary – My home address mapped out in several Google Maps driving direction queries.  Well, now they know where I live… lets hope Bill can’t afford to buy Google.Funny – pamela anderson’s cup size – Honey, one of my coworkers must have typed that in when I wasn’t looking.Funny – hemroid symptoms – Google now knows more about my ass than I’m comfortable with.Scary – My full name – We all Google our own name right?  So what if they have my name and address now.Funny – Kama Sutra – Yeah baby… I was just studying up for the big game!Funny – -inurl:(htm|html|php) intitle:”index of” +”last modified” +”parent directory” +description +size +(mpg|wmv) “paris hilton” – Oh, I’m a big fan of her music, so I was just looking for her latest music video… I swear.When was the last time you checked your Google Web History track record?

"7 Ways to Live Happier Through Love|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/live-happier-through-love.jpg?resize=500%2C375&ssl=1|This is no fluff, straight to the point, action based information that can change your life. To be happy and start living fearless, you only need to know this: You’re not here to win, you’re here to learn. The more you accept this, the less fear, stress, and anxiety you’ll have in your life and the happier you will be. All fear is imagined; thus the side effects of stress and anxiety are self-inflicted. The secret to living a fearless life is truth. Truth about yourself and the purpose you have in this world.  If you put in the dedication of knowing yourself completely and un-dividing your mind, you’ll discover it’s the same with stress and anxiety; it’s all imagined or created in your mind. Yet, even though many accept this logic (of our mind being our biggest problem), then why is everyone still running around full of fear, stress, anxiety, and ultimately unhappiness? One reason is we’re chasing an illusion; the illusion of success and winning defined by society, parents, friends, etc. I too lived the illusion for many years. Since my early twenties I had this image in my mind of what success looked like. It consisted of a loft apartment overlooking the city and driving a Porsche. My idea of success had nothing to do with personal character or the individual I would become; it was based on status and materialism. I would set all these goals for myself, reach them, and then trudge on to the next one. I was never satisfied and still full of fear, anxiety, and stress. Are you stuck? Maybe you’re like I used to be. Trudging through life, not really sure what is wrong while disliking and fearing two things; the way things are and change. I was lucky. I become desperate enough to seek a better way. Not the easier way—at first—but I’ve certainly discovered how to be happy. So can you. Click Here for my FREE eBook, “How to Be Happy Now: Finding Happiness in Everyday Living”  We were married on a beach. It was amazing. Our wedding service consisted of Emily and myself, our wedding official Caroline, and about a dozen chickens. As part of our service, Caroline read something that would be the foundation of our life together. Your “homework” is to practice an ancient Sufi tradition: In your life together, speak words to your beloved only if they can pass through 3 gates: First, is it truthful? Second, is it necessary? Third, is it kind? If your words are truthful & necessary & kind, then the love you have maintained up until today will be nourished and continue to grow & your name will continue to remain safe in your beloved’s mouth. Love for self first and foremost is the Secret to Love that Lasts. Sometimes love is hard to put into words. Here are 31 quotes about love that will inspire your relationship: [Read more…]  I was standing outside talking to a few friends when she came up and asked, “would you like to catch a movie?” Quickly my mind started racing, I needed to come up with an excuse. It’s not that I didn’t want to hang out with her so much, I honestly just wanted to get home and relax. “Sorry,” I said, “can’t, have groceries in the car and need to get the ice cream home.” “What kind?” she asked. “What?” I responded, as my brain needed a few milliseconds to come up with a flavor. “What kind of ice cream?” “Oh, rocky road.” On my drive home I felt guilty, so I dropped by the store and picked up a pint of rocky road. And it occurred to me that I lied for no logical reason. I lied simply because I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. In that moment a rush of memories flooded my consciousness; every time I’d ever lied to someone for no other reason than I didn’t want to hurt their feelings. I didn’t want to hurt their feelings because I needed them to like me. [Read more…]  “You cannot have a positive life and a negative mind.”– Joyce Meyer It was a typical July day in the Midwest. Hot. The previous night my wife Emily and I had returned home from a short trip to see my parents. My father, just ten days previously, had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. The phone rang, it was my mother. She said, “It’s dad…” and in the background I could hear something was going on; people talking and scurrying around. Then I heard my mother say to whomever else was there, “he wants to live!” He didn’t live past that night. But he did live for 65 years. Which is more than some get. In pondering this question what first came to mind was: No matter how bad you think your circumstances are, someone else has it worse. [Read more…]  We met online and it was my first date in almost a year. Just after her margarita and my iced tea arrived, I asked my qualifier question, “If you could go anywhere in the world, where would it be?” Her answer, “Las Vegas.” She didn’t even think about it. I have nothing against Las Vegas, but I was hoping for something a little more exotic or at least outside of the U.S. The following day I had another date with a woman named Emily. Again, “If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would it be?” Her answer, “Belize, because I want to learn how to SCUBA dive and hear the diving is good there.” [Read more…]  Everything has its wonders, even darkness and silence, and I learn, whateverstate I may be in, therein to be content.– Helen Keller Sometimes… I just don’t want to be happy; let alone worrying about how to be happy everyday. I want to sit in a morass of self-pity. But I don’t. Because for me, feeling that way for too long can be dangerous! So I get off my ass and do something. I take action and and it starts with a choice. Although it’s not realistic to be happy 24/7, you can make a choice to be happy (at least at some point in each day). Below are ten tips on how to be happy everyday. Not all are required, but working through the list can produce happiness at some point everyday:  [Read more…] 75 Day-Brightening Stories of Generosity|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/make-the-world-a-better-place.jpg?resize=500%2C348&ssl=1| May your actions speak louder than your words.

"Corporate America Asks Questions Without Wanting True Answers|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/corporate-america.jpg?ssl=1|Have you ever felt momentarily suspended in a complete void of productivity because someone just asked you a question that you knew they did not want an honest answer to? I am not referring to a situation where you are intentionally deceiving a loved one’s trust by hiding information that could emotionally hurt them. The situation I am referring to involves a professional environment where multiple individuals in a strict business relationship disregard the truth in favor of delivering the ideal lie. In other words, these business people ask their associates questions that already have a presumed answer regardless of whether that answer is true or not.For instance, if the regional director Bob of Spazz Inc. asked John, one of his small branch managers, how the brand new employee training system was functioning, would John be honest with his boss? Without any knowledge of the company structure, maybe he would. But what if John knew that Bob had a lead role in convincing the president of Spazz Inc. to pour 25 million dollars into designing the new employee training system. If the training system was truly a faulty disaster, would you expect John to be upfront about it with the director project, whom also happens to sign his paycheckSituations like this create an absolute void of productivity and efficiency. Unfortunately, this sort of thing occurs in corporate America on a daily basis and companies of all sizes suffer from it. This is not just an isolated management dilemma. The problem starts at the root of executive company administration and spills out to every facet in the chain of command. The source of the epidemic correlates directly to a shortfall in the company-wide team building process. When an employee does not feel comfortable with the management, a lack of trust sets in, at which point they will tell their boss exactly what they think their boss wants to hear. And sadly enough, many times this is exactly what the boss desires. Top 5 Timesaving Google Shortcuts and Search Operators|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/timesave.jpg?resize=157%2C138&ssl=1|There is certainly no need for a lengthy introduction to this post.  We all know that Google has some extremely useful shortcuts and advanced search operators.  If used properly while conducting a search, they can save precious time and bring us directly to the information we seek.  I think of it as searching smarter.Below you will find a list of the top five Google shortcuts and search operators that I feel save me the most time on a regular basis.  I list out each operator or shortcut, its purpose, and examples of its use.  The list is in reverse order, saving the best for last.5.  define: – Provides short definitions for words, acronyms, or common phrases.  Google aggregates this info from other websites and links the definitions to their original source.  This operator can be extremely handy when you need the rough meaning of a word in an instant. Examples:define:rss – get the definition of the acronym RSSdefine:aspiration – get the definition of aspiration4.  address, city, state – A quick and dirty shortcut for mapping out a physical address using Google Maps.  Once the address is mapped out, Google Maps provides you with “to” and “from” shortcuts that can be used to create driving directions.  With all my recent business travel, this shortcut has saved hours of my life that would have otherwise been spent on MapQuest… which makes MapQuest obsolete.Examples:1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, 94043 – Shortcut map of Google’s headquarters.701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA, 94089 – Shortcut map of Yahoo’s headquarters.3. site: – Used for concentrating a Google search on a single website or domain name.  There are so many websites out there with flawed search functionality or no search capability at all.  This operator is the solution for saving time when you need to find a certain piece of information on an unorganized website.Examples:site:problogger.net make money – Search for articles containing “make money” on ProBlogger.site:lifehacker.com google music search – Search for articles about “google music search” on Lifehacker.2. filetype: – Filters a search result so that it only includes documents of a specific file format.  Say you are conducting research online and need to find whitepapers that are typically stored in PDF format, this simple Google operator is the answer… a true time saver for online research.Examples:filetype:pdf blogging – Search for PDFs on blogging.filetype:doc search engine optimization – Search for word processing documents on search engine optimization.1. allinanchor: – Conducts a search based on keywords used strictly in the anchor text, or linking text, of third party sites that link to the web pages returned by the Google search.  In other words, this operator filters your search results in a way such that Google ignores the actual textual content of the web pages, but instead bases the search result relevance on the keywords other sites use to reference it.  This search operator can help you save large quantities of time when a normal textual based search query does not fetch the information you desire.  Sometimes you can get a better idea of the content located within a website by reading how the mass refers to that site’s content.Examples:allinanchor:google hacks – Search for websites that other pages link to concerning the topic of Google hacks.allinanchor:wordpress exploits – Search for websites that other pages link to concerning the topic of WordPress exploits.There are several other useful Google shortcuts and advanced search operators not mentioned here, but these five are the true time savers I can’t live without.  PS: I’ve submitted this Top 5 list to the ProBlogger Top 5 Writing Project. You Will Succeed When You Are the Only Person in the World|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/oneperson.jpg?resize=206%2C280&ssl=1|The focus of this discussion is on your world, not the physical planet that every other being on Earth inhabits. It has been my experience that a substantial number of individuals spend a lofty percentage of their time enthralled in other people’s issues. Sometimes they excite themselves, or even upset themselves with these third-party concerns. Compound this wasted time with the fact that most of the individuals involved are completely lost concerning the direction of their own lives, and you begin understand the cyclical source responsible for the renouncement of personal dreams and success.How can anyone successfully conquer their dreams when they ignore the world of possibility they live in? Whomever coined the phrase “the world does not revolve around you” was in complete disconnect with the big picture. It is true that your world does not revolve around me. Likewise, my world certainly does not revolve around you. The world is what you make of it within the infinite bounds of your own individual life. So your world should be the world that matters to you, and thus the exclusive setting in which you focus your time, your energy, and your passion.Am I alluding to the notion that I have it all figured out? Absolutely not, in fact I believe life is a continuous series of lessons. We all have much to learn. This is just food for thought.This post was somewhat inspired by this post.Update: This post was included in the Success and Abundance Lifestyle Carnival.

Discovering a new band or artist that you enjoy can be a truly rewarding experience. Most of us have a modest selection of artists that we love to listen to on a regular basis. But what happens when you yearn for a new set of tunes? Where can you search for different artists and bands with a similar sound to the ones you already listen to?Since most terrestrial radio stations these days play the same forty songs in a continuous loop, finding new music you actually enjoy may seem like a daunting task. But never fear, because while terrestrial radio stations provide a lack of choice, creative minds across the Internet have set up online services specifically designed to assist their users in finding new music that they will enjoy. While each music service differs in design, the ultimate goal remains the same, matching the bands and artists you already like to other artists with a similar sound and message. Some of these services will even stream full songs to your computer speakers allowing you to instantly preview the different artists while you browse through the suggested options.Though there are numerous online music services out there, I have listed the three services that I personally use on a regular basis. I believe the quality of service provided by each of these three websites is a step ahead of the competition. Each one will help you discover new music you are bound to enjoy by evaluating different artists based specifically to your tastes.Last.fm – This is by far my favorite online music service. Last.fm provides one of the most mature social networking websites geared for connecting users to new music of all genres. Users can create and share personal radio stations or even stream full songs or album previews to their computers instantaneously. The site presents a few different methods for getting personalized artist recommendations, allowing casual users and power users alike to discover new tunes.One method is to simply search on Last.fm for an artist that you like and then preview the suggested artists/songs that the search query returns right in your web browser. Another more advanced option involves downloading their Audioscrobbler plugin and the Last.fm music player, which together allow for a more fine tuned interaction with the Last.fm artist suggestion knowledgebase. The plugin can track all the Mp3s you listen to on your computer and then create custom radio stations based on your listening habits. The player can stream these custom radio stations to your computer, allowing you to indulge in the full songs of suggested artists. Last.fm rocks, so check it out!Pandora – Pandora is strictly designed to provide users with a personalized streaming radio station. You type in the name of an artist you like and it will create a custom radio station tailored to the artist’s musical style. Pandora utilizes a pretty sophisticated music evaluation algorithm that informs it’s users on the specifics of each artist’s musical style and tempo. As you listen you can give feedback on the particular songs you like or dislike which Pandora will use to refine your future custom playlists.This service does not provide the ability to choose certain recommended artists from a list. It simply streams a continuous set of full songs to your computer speakers and allows you to skip the ones you don’t like. Even with this limitation, Pandora has a massive artist database, so you are sure to find new artists that you will enjoy.Liveplasma (formerly Musicplasma) – Liveplasma doesn’t quite peak out at the level of technical sophistication held by the likes of Last.fm and Pandora. However, Liveplasma is a simple Flash based music recommendation site that is easy to use and fun to browse. The recommendations aren’t nearly as plentiful and you can’t instantly stream the suggested songs to your computer, but it’s still a pretty cool service. Simply put, clicking around on Liveplasma can be a blast.All three of these online music services will connect you to a new and exciting set of tunes. I recommend giving each one of them a whirl. Have fun… and rock on!Also check out the latest album charts:The Latest Top Album ChartsHot New ReleasesMovers and Shakers Advice for the Groom: The Wedding Ring Selection|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/weddingrings.jpg?resize=250%2C232&ssl=1|At first this might not sound like the most ideal task, but in reality it absolutely is. If you think about it, every single festivity in a wedding revolves around the exchange of these sacred rings. Not only can you make this task fun, but you will come out a hero in he eyes of your “bride to be” and all her family. If executed properly, you will also have a romantic story to share with loved ones for decades to come.This task involves the purchase of both the diamond engagement ring and the subsequent wedding bands. You don’t buy them all at once, so this task is really a two part process. Certain steps in the process might seem a little extravagant or bazaar to some people. But just remember, I’ve been there, done that, and I’m extremely content with the end result. So while everyone is entitled to their opinion, my advice is from firsthand experience.Your first step is the worst step, but you have to handle it. You must do some simple research on Blue Nile. All of the info you will need in order to make an educated engagement ring purchase is on this site, including solid price points that can be used when you shop. A NY Times editorial on Blue Nile can be found here. Don’t waste your time on all the flashy female driven wedding ring sites… most of them are a complete piss in the wind. You want the facts and Blue Nile delivers these facts. You can also read this, this or this for a little extra credit research only if you feel like being diligent.Take a trip to New York City with a couple of your buddies or male family members. You are going to buy her engagement ring from the shops in the New York City diamond exchange district on West 47th Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. Just inform your lady that you are going on a business trip or attending to some form of family business affair. If you plan ahead and set things up in advance, she’ll never suspect a thing. If you’re worried about lying to her, get over it. Believe me that when the time comes, not only will she understand, she will be ecstatic with your romantic efforts. Here’s why the NYC idea makes sense:You can wheel and deal with the diamond exchange merchants using the price points and education you gained from Blue Nile. The merchants are used to bargaining and they will come down in price when they realize that you are serious about the purchase. The process of bargaining alone can be a crap-load of fun and rather hilarious at times. It certainly beats the heck out of talking to an old boring saleswoman at the local jeweler.There are an abundance of shops and a plethora of ring choices which guarantees that you are going to find something you really like at the price you want to spend. Matching different settings with different diamonds can actually be pretty interesting, and you will begin to realize that the four C’s (cut/color/clarity/carat) ratings that you read about on Blue Nile weren’t a bunch of bullshit after all.The ring you build in NYC won’t be sitting in the case at your local jewelry store either. Even if there is a particular style that your beloved has already mentioned she likes, the diamond exchange merchants will have four thousand variations of that style from which you can choose. The ring will be unique, and all her female family members and friends will notice it as such. Not to mention, she will love the fact that you went to such great lengths to customize her ring.Look around, you’re in freakin’ New York City! Picking out the engagement ring will take a total of a few hours of bargaining over the course two or three days. The remainder of the time is a “vacation with the boys” in one of the coolest cities in the world.It will be the only vacation you ever take with your male counterparts that can be flipped around and told as a romantic story to loved ones. And if you really think about it, it is actually romantic. You ventured out on a lengthy voyage to pick out the perfect engagement ring for the woman you love.Once you have popped the question and revealed to your beloved the great journey that you embarked on in order to build the precious diamond ring she has already fallen in love with, suggest another trip to NYC. This time the two of you will take a romantic weekend getaway to the city and choose your wedding bands together. It will be fun for the both of you and the trip will double as a vacation. You already know the ropes so you’ll look like the expert. And if you’re really smart, you can even head back to the same merchant that you purchased her engagement ring from. Because you are a loyal repeat customer, they might be inclined to give out a little discount on the wedding bands.I strongly recommend this wedding ring purchasing process to every “groom to be” that is about to embark on the journey of marriage. I know it sounds a little pricey, but just remember that even though you will be dropping extra cash on travel arrangements, you will be getting way more ring for your money. The diamond merchants will even FedEX the rings to you via insured air shipping which allows you to avoid paying sales tax on your purchase. (F.Y.I. – I found the engagement ring I liked at Allure Diamond, which is where I ended up making my purchases.) Good luck out there…Next week I’ll continue the series by posting some more heroic wedding tasks for the groom that he will actually enjoy. "
"How To Write the Perfect Love Letter in 3 Short Paragraphs|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/how-to-write-a-perfect-love-letter.jpg?resize=165%2C166&ssl=1|Writing the perfect love letter can be quite a challenge. After all, love is an emotion, and it can be extremely difficult to accurately transcribe your emotions into a meaningful set of words. It’s easy to spell out the phrase “I love you”, but those words are relatively hollow without a little contextual substantiation.3 Simple QuestionsSo, how do you substantiate the authenticity and depth of your love without writing a lengthy novel depicting every detail of your relationship? It’s actually quite simple. Just ask yourself 3 questions:What feelings are inspiring me to write this love letter?If I write only one short paragraph expressing my love, how will I convince my significant other that this paragraph is all I needed to write?What will this one paragraph say?Answer for Your Significant OtherAnswer each question for your significant other as if she or he asked you the question. In other words, direct your answers toward the recipient of your love letter. Take some time and put sincere thought into each of your answers, but limit each answer to a short paragraph between 3 to 5 sentences in length.Finalize the Love LetterPut a greeting before paragraph #1 and a few romantic closing remarks after paragraph #3. Proofread and sign your name at the bottom. It’s a wrap.Here’s an example, a love letter I recently wrote to my wife:Angel,I found myself sitting here tonight on our first anniversary reminiscing about all the unforgettable times we’ve shared together. Just thinking about it makes me glow inside. More so than being happy, I am proud to be part of something extraordinary, you.I was going to write a lengthy, detailed letter confessing my unconditional love to you, but it would be somewhat of a waste. It would be a waste to write a letter so extensive when my feelings remain so logically simple in my mind. It only takes a few words to clearly describe how I feel about you.To everyone else who knows you, you are a bright, capable over-achiever who is beautiful and remarkably confident. Without you, their lives would be a little more difficult and a little less pleasant. To me, you are me. Without you, I would not be me. I would not faintly resemble the man I am today.It’s that simple.Happy 1st Anniversary!Love always,Marc Reduce Morning Stress in 11 Simple Steps|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/reduce-morning-stress.jpg?resize=230%2C158&ssl=1|If we fail to appropriately manage our time and health needs, mornings can be the most stressful part of our day.  Many of us deal with the dizziness of an unpleasant, hectic rush every morning in preparation for work or school, but it doesn’t have to be this way.  With a little sensible time management your morning stress can be drastically abbreviated.  Here are 11 simple steps you can follow to proactively reduce your level of morning stress.Lose an hour in the morning, and you will be all day hunting for it.-Richard WhatelyCreate an Evening Preparation Routine – An evening routine in preparation for the morning, that is.  Iron your clothes, prepare your lunch, locate your keys, plan a nutritious breakfast, etc.  These simple tasks will take you less than 30 minutes to complete each evening and will save you a huge headache every morning.Plan a Realistic Day – Write a short “Must Do Today” list every evening for the following day.  Never fill your mind with unnecessary worries in the excess of this list.  Write down anything that cannot be pushed off to the following day.  Avoid the tendency to overpopulate this list, and thus your schedule, with unrealistic goals.Eliminate Known Aggravations – If your alarm clock makes a horribly annoying sound, the electric razor burns your skin, and your car’s windshield wipers are faulty… fix the problems and eliminate the stress factors permanently from your life.  There is absolutely no reason to deal with habitual aggravations that can easily be resolved with a little time and money.Get a Good Night’s Sleep – Make sure you start winding down for bed at a reasonable hour to allow enough time for a healthy night’s sleep.  Most people require between 7 and 8 hours each night.  If needed, set a bedtime reminder alarm on your alarm clock.  Always keep the temperature in your bedroom comfortably cool.  Studies from the National Sleep Foundation suggest the ideal temperature for sleeping is somewhere between 54 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit.  Also, go easy on afternoon caffeine intake.  When caffeine is consumed late in the day the quality of your sleep usually suffers.  Wake Up 30 Minutes Earlier – An extra 30 minutes in the morning is the difference between peaceful harmony and rapid-fire pandemonium.  As long as you get to bed on time, waking up 30 minutes earlier should seem natural after just a few days.  Use this time to think, stretch, shower, eat breakfast, and account for any unanticipated bumps in your morning routine.Drink a Glass of Water First Thing – Water makes up between 60% – 70% of your body composition.  It is absolutely vital to stay properly hydrated.  Even mild dehydration can cause your blood to thicken.  This forces your heart to work double-time in order to push the necessary blood to your organs, which will result in noticeable mental fatigue.  Also, a hydrated body is more efficient at dispersing energy-building nutrients to all its extremities.  Since the average human body becomes slightly dehydrated over the course of a long sleep, you should drink a tall glass of water first thing when you wake up.Do a Light 10 Minute Stretching Workout – Do you feel a little groggy when you first wake up?  This is completely normal.  All you need to do is get your blood flowing, which will assist your body in transitioning between the sleeping and awake states.  Once you do, you’ll feel great.  Place a matt or towel on a carpeted floor.  Lie on your back and stretch your arms as far as you can in one direction while stretching your toes out in the opposite direction.  Then stand up and do some knee raises and toe touches.  If you are feeling up to it, add in a few sit-ups and push-ups.Listen to Music and Take a Hot Shower – Music injects positive, motivational influence into your mind.  You should listen to music that makes you happy every morning while you progress through your routine.  Also, a hot shower can be one of the most soothing experiences early in the morning.  The fresh, revitalized feeling you have stepping out of the shower will spill over as positivity into your first few tasks of the day.Keep a Clean, Organized Living Space – Create order in your life and living space.  Organize your home so that you always know exactly where your belongings are.  Then, consciously put your belongings away in their proper place each time you use them.  Doing so will eliminate the unproductive, stress filled moments of searching for something you’ve misplaced.Never Drive Home with an Empty Gas Tank – Filling up a car’s gas tank is so darn easy, but it does take a few minutes of your time.  Why then, do so many people procrastinate on filling up their cars with gas until the busy mornings when they can’t spare any time without being late?  Never do this!  Check your gas tank level on the way home.  If it’s getting low, pull into a gas station and fill it up immediately.Schedule Something You Love Daily – Getting up to face a new day is far more satisfying when you have something to look forward to.  Life is short.  Make sure you manage your time effectively so that you have time to engage in something you love on a daily basis.There will always be exceptions, but faithfully following the steps above should help you conquer most of your mornings with reduced stress and a lot more grace. The 30 Most Satisfying Simple Pleasures Life Has to Offer|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/simple-pleasures-in-life.jpg?resize=210%2C186&ssl=1|There are certain intricacies in life that we all repeatedly and unintentionally celebrate on a regular basis. These celebrated incidents are composed of the smaller things in life, those seemingly inconsequential events that instantly place us in a better mood. If you think about it hard enough, I’ll bet that you have taken part in each one of the following acts of subconscious celebration: 20 Practical Life Lessons Kids Can Teach Us|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/life-lessons-kids-can-teach-us.jpg?resize=220%2C163&ssl=1|Here is a list of 26 life lessons I have learned thus far at the age of 26.  I pass this list on to you with the simple hope that it makes you think.  Sometimes thinking about your life and sorting out what you have learned is just as important as tackling a new venture. Check out these books for more life lessons and tips: Brain Hacking: 10 Easy Steps to Improving Your Memory|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/brain-hacks.jpg?resize=205%2C182&ssl=1|Editor’s note:  This is a guest post from freelance writer Heather Johnson. If you are starting to feel your age it might be because your memory is slipping at the most inopportune times.  Or, maybe you already have a decent memory and would just like to improve it so you can beat your buddies at Trivial Pursuit.  Think of your mind as a series of disorganized file cabinets.  The information is already there.  If you follow the 10 steps below, you can access any file you want at a much quicker pace.Read a Book Every Week – In order to keep your mind active you need to always be learning.  No, you don’t need to settle in with some Carl Sagan and a thesaurus every night.  Believe it or not, even some light “beach reading” will get your neurons firing more rapidly than whatever you have saved on your DVR.Streamline Your Daily Tasks – Multitasking to the point of exhaustion is a memory killer.  Hone your ability to delegate tasks that are cluttering your work life and/or home life.  If you can get away with a little procrastination by pushing the less important tasks back, that will work also.  Over scheduling your life will induce major brain drain.Find a Quiet Spot – If you would like to study, read, balance the checkbook, etc. you need to have a quiet spot where you can concentrate and soak up as much information as possible.   Just like multi-tasking, a loud and distracting environment will tire your brain.Sleep Eight Hours Every Night – Uninterrupted sleep may be an impossibility for surgeons or parents of small children, but you really should aim for those eight hours each night.  Many of us have the opportunity to get a full night’s rest, yet opt to watch some television or catch up with something else.  You absolutely cannot sacrifice sleep and expect to have a good memory the next day.Tap Into Your Creativity – If you’re not exercising your creativity there are areas of your brain that go wasted every day.  Take up a creative hobby or, at the very least, pick up a pencil on occasion and doodle.Start a Journal or Blog – This might sound like a chore, but you don’t have to write a journal or blog entry every day.  Write when the mood strikes or when you actually have something interesting to say.  Documenting your life is one of the best ways to preserve your memory.Take a Daily Multivitamin – Make sure you take the best vitamin for your gender and age.  Even if you can’t eat like a health nut all the time, at least you’ll get most of your necessary vitamins with the help of a supplement.Drink Plenty of Water – Water does wonders for your mind and body.  Most people don’t realize that they walk around slightly dehydrated all the time.  Dehydration can be the source of a lot of problems.Keep Your Home Tidy – Maybe you don’t subscribe to Feng Shui, but disorganized people often have a worse memory than those who keep their house clean.  An organized environment encourages clear thinking.Don’t Smoke – If you do smoke, you now have one more reason to put those cigarettes down.  Studies have shown an increase in memory loss amongst regular smokers. At the very least, these 10 steps should help you attain and maintain a more healthy memory.About the author:  Heather Johnson is a freelance business, finance and economics writer, as well as a regular contributor at Business Credit Cards, a site for tracking the best business credit card offers.  Heather welcomes comments and freelancing job inquiries at her email address [email protected].

"A Blank Expression Expresses More Than We Think|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/blank-face.jpg?resize=235%2C201&ssl=1|It occurred to me recently while walking the streets of downtown Orlando that a blank facial expression can actually express more about someone’s mindset than a face busy with varying expressions.   It becomes candidly evident when you look up at the blank faces walking past you, naturally striving ever so vigilantly to avoid eye contact.  Their face muscles are relaxed, yet their appearance is uninviting.  Even though there appears to be no obvious sign of emotion, most people respond as if there is a clear message being conveyed.   These blank faces of expression seem to communicate a subtle warning for others to keep their distance.  Some of them also indicate that the person is enthralled in deep thought, and disturbing such thought is probably not desired.  If I needed directions and quickly glanced around a public space filled with people, I know I would feel more comfortable interrupting someone already involved in a conversation, rather than taking my chances with the seemingly cold look of a blank, expressionless passerby.  It’s fascinating how the innocuous act of carrying a blank expression actually startles the people around you.  Here in the Real World: 20 Lessons for Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/20-lessons-for-life.jpg?resize=245%2C184&ssl=1|Well, I’ve been part of the “real world” for a few years now.  My transition from college into the 9 to 5 workforce was fairly smooth.  There are certainly people who handled it better than I did, but I also know quite a few folks who are still struggling with the changeover.  These first few years in the “real world” have been filled with crash-course life lessons, frequent hustle, and rapid career progression.  As I progress I try to keep track of what works and what does not.  I’m constantly in the process of analyzing both my successes and my failures in order to properly realign my future actions with my goals.  Below you will find a list of 20 life lessons I’ve learned in the “real world” thus far.Be Passionate, but Also Be Realistic – I’ve experienced so many intelligent people (myself included) get overly passionate about something before fully evaluating the big picture.  Passion without realistic direction leads to frustration and failure.Keep Up with Current Events – In college it’s easy to hold such a narrow focus on your social life and your classes that everything else in life flies right over your head.  In the working world, however, not knowing who Ben Bernanke is or why North Korea is in the news so often can lead you into some horribly embarrassing dialogues.There is a Difference between a List of Goals and a Wish List – Most people understand that goals are desired outcomes that we must work to attain.  Yet it’s amazing how many people I’ve met that lack the necessary drive and just sit there waiting for a miracle to move them forward.Everyone is Multidimensional and so are Our Successes – I’ve met wealthy people who seem unhappy and happy people who are underpaid.  I’ve met successful businessmen who have been divorced 3 times and happily married men who can’t seem to find a job they like.  Just because someone is successful in one part of their life, does not necessarily mean they are universally successful.Talent Does Not Equal Success – I’ve seen talented people fail.  Why?  Because even though they had the talent, they lacked the initiative and commitment necessary for success.  Laziness will always overshadow talent.Relocation is the Pits – Moving all of your belongings from one place to another is usually a more intense endeavor than originally imagined.  This process takes time, so plan for it.  Also, do yourself a favor, don’t be a pack-rat.  It only makes matters worst.Fear Will Only Hold You Back – The most effective means are not always the most comforting.  It is imperative that we take educated chances in our lives.  If it makes sense to do so, we must be ready to step outside of our comfort zone.Learn to Cook – This could easily save you thousands of dollars every single year.  Eating out is expensive, eating in is cheap… nuff said!  Learn to cook, and learn to limit the number of meals you eat out.Emotional Decisions are Usually Bad Decisions – Decisions driven by heavy emotion are typically misguided reactions rather than proactive judgments.  These reactions are decisions made with a minimal amount of thought.  Sometimes our feelings are based on impulse, instead of sound experience.  Always consult your better judgment.There Are Different Levels of Intellect – Overall intelligence isn’t just about IQ.  I’ve met some extremely intelligent people who are complete social and emotional morons.Drinking Water is Important – It’s a simple concept, I know.  But when we get overly consumed in our busy routines, the simple act of drinking water skips our minds.  Make sure your hydrate yourself.  You’ll feel better and you’ll be healthier.Bad Feedback Can Be Better than Good Feedback – Even though I hate getting bad feedback, I’ve come to except the fact that it actually pushes me in the right direction.  It gives me the ability to improve myself.  Excessive good feedback just allows me sit put and feel accomplished (which isn’t always a bad thing 😉 ).Utilize Your Instincts – Not everything is what is seems.  Not everyone who seems trustworthy actually is.  Even though it is important to listen to what your friends, colleagues and acquaintances say, you must never ignore your own instincts.  Sometimes they can help you evaluate circumstances far better than any third-party reference.Get Enough Sleep – This should seem like common sense, yet so many of us fail to get enough sleep on a regular basis.  You will not be productive if you are exhausted… that’s the bottom line.Motivation Fluctuates, But Finish What You Start – I’ve seen countless people (myself included) get a sudden burst of motivation and start a project, but before the project is complete the motivation wears off.  Thus, the project is never completed.  It usually amounts to a complete waste of time, money and creativity.  Understand that your levels of motivation will fluctuate, but you must still finish what you start.Flexibility for Change is Vital – Most of us are comfortable where we are even though the whole universe is constantly changing around us.  Learning to accept change is vital to our happiness and general success.Identify What You Don’t Want – It’s important to understand that the things we don’t want are just as important as the things we do want.  For instance, if you don’t want to have kids but you do want to have sex, there are multiple solutions to keep you inline with your goals.  If you ignore what you don’t want and put all your attention on what you do want, you’ll end up getting what you don’t want.Problems Don’t Just Disappear – Almost everyone I know has fallen victim to the fallout of avoiding a problem.  Sooner rather than later it becomes apparent that the problem only gets worse.  Problems must be addressed, they don’t just disappear.Get the Important Things Done First – This certainly isn’t ground breaking advice, but it is a simple principle that works wonders.  Let your mind tackle the important tasks while it’s rested, then the rest of the day basically is yours to enjoy.Take Ownership of Your Actions – Consciously think before you act.  When the decision is made to act, always take full ownership of your actions, even when the outcome is negative.  It’s easy to take ownership of success, but eventually the headline will read “failure”.  When it does, only those who properly address the issue have the capability to succeed in the long term. The Google Anonymous are Safe and Jobless|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/google-anonymous.jpg?resize=174%2C231&ssl=1|In today’s fast paced, highly competitive job market where first impressions are the fine line between success and failure, you must be keenly aware of your online image.  Bear in mind that a rising number of human resource recruiters are using Google when gathering information on potential employees.  The necessity to maintain a clean online image should be common sense.  We all know that posting photos of ourselves dancing on bar tops and/or partaking in acts radicalism probably won’t help our image in the eyes of an employer. With these points in mind, being anonymous on Google might sound like a safe bet.  But what really happens if a Google search for your name comes back blank?  If an employer searches Google for your name and absolutely no results are returned, are you really any better off?  The answer may be no.  A mid-2006 market analysis by career search firm ExecuNet reported that 77% of the job recruiters claim they use search engines as a primary tool to research potential employees.  It seems quite probable that this percentage has increased drastically in the last year. If Google can’t locate a single webpage that references you, how much of an impact could you have possibly made in your career?  If you have a tech based career it paints an even darker picture of your past performance.  Having your own web presence says something about your contributions to the market itself.  Even if your presence is derived from short intelligent comments left on professional forums, it shows that you are actively involved and aware of what is going on.The best defense against being Google anonymous is a good offense.  Be proactive.  Create a web presence that you are proud to identify with.  When you set out to build this presence, use your real name if you want people to find you. Here are 3 ideas to get you started:1.  Create a Blog – Blogger Adam Darowski suggests that the blog is the new resume.  If executed properly, it could be even better than a resume.  It is a true representation of who you are, spoken freely in your own words.  Your blog has the power to completely influence someone’s opinion about you.  It satisfies the curiosity of any entity, especially potential employers, which might Google you to see what kind of person you are.  The key is to show them your best, but remain truthful while doing so.  Truth is the key to success for any blogger. You can create a free blog using one of the following sites:WordPress.comBlogger.comLiveJournal.com2.  Create a Personal Website – Popular domain sellers like GoDaddy and Yahoo Small-Business have simple step-by-step webpage creation tools that allow non-techie users to setup attractive websites.  A website is designed to be more static than a blog, so you are not expected to update it as often.  It could be used as a professional web portfolio by including your resume, professional works, career summaries, goals, etc.Get started with a personal website:GoDaddyYahoo Small-Business3.  Use Professional Networking Sites – Professional social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Ziggs can also assist you in establishing a respectable online presence that will be searchable via Google.  Both sites allow you to build an online profile, associate it with past employers, and network with professional contacts.Get started with professional social networking:LinkedInZiggs Just remember, if you don’t exist to Google, you may not exist at all. 7 Clever Google Tricks Worth Knowing|http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=marandang-20&l=ur2&o=1| Force of Character: Taking Ownership of Your Actions|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/force-of-character.jpg?resize=230%2C207&ssl=1|My buddy Sam and I recently had a conversation about the unique qualities associated with a person possessing a strong moral character, or as he coined the phrase, “force of character”.   People with noble intentions are found everywhere, but people with “force of character” stand out from the crowd.  As the fire inside the rest of us flickers from gusts of indecision, these minds usually burn bright and rise above the storm while confidently pressing forward.  They seem to know the secret for personal success.  This buried secret also indirectly draws in the individual regard and respect of others.Most of us start off with a similar set of good intentions.  So what do people with “force of character” do differently?  What is their secret to success?  I think it comes down to one thing and one thing alone.  They consciously think before they act, and when the decision is made to act, they always take full ownership of their actions.  They immediately reap the benefits of their successful acts, but also quickly and openly address those that went awry.  Possessing “force of character” means dependably taking responsibility for your own actions, even when the outcome is negative.Negative actions are initial failures, but they are not long term failures unless they are ignored.  When strong moral value and good intent is combined with failure, a resolution is always found.  Remember that most headline news is generally bad news, even when it’s scaled down into small social circles.  By honestly addressing the effects of a negative action you visibly sooth the minds of anyone affected, thus turning bad news into good news.  Everyone respects honesty.  It’s easy for someone to take ownership of success, but when the headlines read “failure” only those possessing “force of character” have the influential capacity to shine.

"The 7 Habits of Highly Happy People|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/happy-habits.jpg?resize=464%2C242&ssl=1|Highly happy people all share happy habits.  It’s as simple as that.  The happiest people I know share 7 very obvious habits.  If you’re looking to expand your general happiness you may consider adopting these habits in your own life.Most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.-Abraham LincolnBe a Part of Something You Believe In – This could be anything.  People may take an active role in their local city council, find refuge in religious faith, join a social club supporting causes they believe in, or find passion in their careers.  In each case the physiological outcome is the same.  They engage themselves in something they strongly believe in.  This engagement brings happiness and meaning into their lives.Share Time with Friends and Family – A happy life is a life shared with friends and family.  The stronger the personal relationships are and the higher the frequency of interaction, the happier a person will be.Reflect on the Good – Quite often people concentrate too much of their attention on negative outcomes and leave no time to positively reflect on their successes.  It’s natural for a person to want to correct undesirable circumstances and focus closely on doing so, but there must be a healthy balance in the allocation of personal awareness.  It is important to mindfully reflect on the good while striving diligently to correct the bad.  A continuous general awareness of your daily successes can have a noticeably positive affect on your overall emotional happiness.Exploit the Resources You DO Have Access To – The average person is usually astonished when they see a physically handicap person show intense signs of emotional happiness.  How could someone in such a restricted physical state be so happy?  The answer rests in how they use the resources they do have.  Stevie Wonder couldn’t see, so he exploited his sense of hearing into a passion for music, and he now has 25 Grammy Awards to prove it.Create Happy Endings Whenever Possible – The power of endings is quite remarkable.  The end of any experience has a profound impact on a person’s overall perception of the experience as a whole.  Think about reading a fairly well written, thought provoking novel.  Now imagine the ending totally sucks.  Even if the story was captivating up until the ending, would you still be happy recommending the novel to a friend?  People always remember the ending.  If the ending is happy, the experience creates happiness.  Always tie loose ends, leave things on a good note, and create happy endings in your life whenever possible.Use Personal Strengths to Get Things Done – Everyone possesses unique personal strengths.  We all have different talents and skill sets.  Emotional happiness comes naturally to those who use their strengths to get things done.  The state of completion always creates a sense of achievement.  If this achievement is based exclusively on your own personal ability to get the job done, the physiological rewards are priceless.Savor the Natural Joy of Simple Pleasures – I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the best things in life are free.  They come in the form of simple pleasures and they appear right in front of you at various locations and arbitrary times.  They are governed by Mother Nature and situational circumstance and captured by mindful awareness.  It’s all about taking a moment to notice the orange and pink sunset reflecting off the pond water as you hold hands with someone you love.  Noticing these moments and taking part in them regularly will bring unpredictable bursts of happiness into your life.Also, check out these great books for more insight on

Do|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/knowledge.jpg?resize=178%2C218&ssl=1| How To Live The Good Life|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/the-good-life.jpg?resize=466%2C157&ssl=1|Living the good life means different things to different people.  There is, however, a slightly ambiguous, mutual understanding.  “The good life” is the life that you would like to live broken down to its most basic form.  It deals with the simple pleasures that make you happy, the compassionate deeds you perform, the personal goals you strive to achieve, the relationships you nurture and the legacy you leave behind.  Sincere personal fulfillment is generally the collective end result.“The good life” is also about appreciating all your time, not just your leisure time.  Far too many people get caught up in the mad rush of a corporate lifestyle and grow completely numb to the little moments, the simple building blocks of time that make life magical.  Time, after all, is the single greatest element of life.This world, after all our science and sciences, is still a miracle; wonderful, magical and more, to whosoever will think of it.– Thomas CarlyleSlow Down – Urgency and haste instantly diminish accuracy, awareness and happiness.  There is a big difference between getting things done and getting things done effectively.Appreciate Life’s Simple Pleasures – The best things in life are free.  From a quiet lakeside sunset to sleeping in on a rainy day, life’s greatest simple pleasures can only be purchased with mindful awareness.Foster and Nurture Relationships – A happy, fulfilling life is a life shared with family and friends.Be Self Sufficient – Freedom is the greatest gift.  Self sufficiency is the greatest freedom.Learn About Different Things – In life, a jack of all trades is far more equipped than a master of only one.  Combining the two is the key.Concentrate on Your Passions – True wealth comes naturally to those who are passionate about their endeavors.Travel to Distant Places – There are places in this world that will open your mind to realities you’ve never imagined in your wildest dreams.  These realities will inject your conscience with healthy, new perspectives.Talk to Strangers – Quite simply, this is how you will meet great people.Exercise Your 5 Senses – Sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch.  Each provides a gateway to rewarding personal experiences.Use What You Have – Success is not the byproduct of limitless resources.  Success happens when you stretch the limits of the available resources.Assist Others – What goes around comes around.  Nuff said.Be Clear on Your Goals – You will never get where you want to go if you don’t know what you want.Make a Decision – Indecision is the leading cause of missed opportunity and wasted time.Practice General Time Management – Trying to achieve your goals without doing a little time planning is like sailing the open ocean without a compass and map.Leave Time for Spontaneous Excursions – Opportunity sometimes knocks at unexpected times.  Make sure you have enough flexibility in your schedule to respond accordingly.Educate Yourself on the Facts – Ignorance is only bliss in a vacuum.  In the real world you will eventually be confronted with the facts, and by then it may`be too late.  Be aware of reality, get your facts straight and make educated decisions.Think More, Talk Less – The more you think and the less you talk, the more you will learn and the less you will miss.Own Up to Your Actions – Either you own up to your actions or your actions will ultimately own you.Keep Your Promises – Not doing so guarantees loneliness and failure.Always Find the Positive Lesson – Every negative outcome holds a positive lesson.  Finding it is the key to greatness.Forget Perfection, Find Satisfaction – Perfect is the enemy of good.  The idea of perfection is based primarily on personal opinion, circumstance and flexibility.  Instead of searching for perfection, find something that satisfies your needs.Eat Clean – Never doubt the old adage “you are what you eat”.Sleep Well – A tired mind is inefficient and unhappy.Laugh – Some of the most memorable moments in your life will be moments spent in laughter.Be Here Now – Right now is the only moment guaranteed to you.  Right now is life.  Don’t miss it.Also, check out these best selling books for more life tips:The Road Less Traveled: A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual GrowthThe How of HappinessThe

Mind|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/business-creativity.jpg?resize=464%2C158&ssl=1|The monotonous repetition and visual sameness found in the common office space could suck the creativity out of Picasso.  The environment you inhabit has a powerful affect on the way you think and feel.  If everything around you looks the same, your mind will eventually grow numb.  Likewise, if you do the same exact thing in the same exact way at the same exact location every day, you may very well think the same exact thoughts over and over again.Your creativity relies heavily on your attitude, and your attitude relies on your enthusiasm, motivation and positivity.  Trying to maintain a positive attitude in a monotonous business environment can be tough.  And if your creativity is stifled because your attitude sucks, your effective productivity rate will plunge as well.So what can you do to spark your business-minded creativity at the office?  I love to play around with innovative ways of approaching life at work.  Not everyone gets a chance to escape the 9 to 5 office space environment, but that doesn’t mean they can’t escape the monotony by exploiting their creative edge within it.Here are 10 business creativity tips to help you get your mind on track:Be a Visitor in Your Own Office – Sit in the guest chair on the opposite side of your desk for an hour or so.  It will give you a fresh visual perspective on the same old environment.  If you don’t have a guest chair or your own office, roll your work chair to a new location and bring your laptop and supplies with you.  Even the slightest change in your physical setting can stimulate your senses and your creativity.  Don’t be afraid to switch locations a few times a day.  It may sound strange, but it makes a world of difference.Rotate Your Artwork and Photographs – First things first, buy some artwork you like.  Also, frame a few photographs of the important people in your life and place them throughout your personal office space.  Rotate the wall art from wall to wall every two weeks.  Do the same with the photos.  Occasionally swap out the artwork and photos for new ones.  You could even exchange them with others you already have at your house.Get a Cool Chair (or Chairs) – Just like moving around, swapping that boring grey desk chair for a cool, comfortable Aeron or HAG Capisco can keep your senses refreshed and your creative edge alive.  If funds aren’t an issue, get both and switch it up every few hours.Re-purpose Unused Office Space – Poll your coworkers for the most creative (and applicable) use of the unused space.  How about a sitting area with comfortable chairs, a few live plants, some inspirational artwork and a dry erase board?  Make sure you get your superiors on board with the idea.  Sell them on the benefits of a creative work environment.Play Musical Chairs at Meetings – Break out of the foolish grade school habit of continually sitting in the same seat.  Sit next to different people, participate in their conversations and become more conscious of what each of them brings to the table.  They may surprise you and open your mind to new ideas.Write Down Every Idea – Simple ideas fuel creativity.  Write down everything and anything that crosses your mind, even the simple ideas that seem stupid.  A critical part of having a good idea is the act of capturing every idea you have.  Capturing other people’s ideas is also a beneficial practice.  Maintain an idea list and then mindfully sort through them at an alternate location and time.Take Short Stimulation Breaks – Read some quotes that inspire you.  Watch a motivational video clip.  Listen to one of your favorite tunes.  Or, you could create a small play space with some mind stimulating puzzles and games.Break Your Routines – Routines can serve a useful purpose, but they also close the door on creativity.  Small changes in your routines can lead to fresh, invigorating experiences and creative thought patterns.  For instance, instead of driving to work, take the bus or carpool.  Go out to lunch with different people.  Try new things.Mandate Personal Brainstorming Sessions – Brainstorming is essential to creative thinking.  Set enough time aside to brainstorm at least once a day.  Don’t stop until you have at least 10 points written down.  Add these points to the idea list I discussed above.Buy Fun Supplies – I’m certainly not an advocate of needless spending, but I do support the occasional creativity / productivity enhancing purchase.  Need some ideas?  How about a colorful set of dry erase markers, a calendar themed to your liking, a gigantic bulletin board, and an art-styled writing table? A Sad, Familiar Tale of Procrastination|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/procrastination.jpg?resize=240%2C185&ssl=1|He has always dreamed of pursuing a career in computer hardware engineering.  “I want to design my own chipset”, he used to tell his Computer Science teacher in high school.  Now, as a junior enrolled at a reputable technical college, he finally has the chance to make his dream a reality.  Although he somewhat slacked his way through the two years of general education courses, he always knew he would have to be studious during his junior year when the core engineering classes started.He wakes up every morning filled with excitement and positive intentions.  Studying is actually the first thing that crosses his mind.  “I’ve got to get that chapter read”, he tells himself.  But first he needs to grab some Starbucks and a muffin.  “Okay, now I’m ready.”He sits down at his dorm room desk and cracks open the book “Modern Computer Hardware Design”.  The phone rings.  It’s Jane, a good friend he met in his sophomore English class.  “Lunch, today?  Yeah, I could do that.  How’s noon sound?  Perfect.  See you then.”  Before he sits back down to read he remembers that he skipped his workout yesterday.  “A quick workout will only take 45 minutes and it will energize my mind and prepare me for a couple hours of diligent studying”, he thinks to himself.  He puts on his sneakers, grabs his iPod and heads over to the campus gym. When he returns from the gym, he takes a shower and is again ready to start reading.  Page one: “Welcome to the exciting world of computer hardware design.  This book is divided into…”  “Ah, crap!  I forgot to email my mother those photos I promised her.  Heck, it will only take a second.”  He quickly opens up his laptop and logs into Gmail.  Before he has time to send the email he gets an IM from an old high school buddy, Greg, who he hasn’t spoken to in six months.  After a forty-five minute chat session, he fires the email off to his mother and returns to the book.He glances up at the wall clock and realizes he only has about thirty minutes before he has to leave to meet Jane for lunch.  “Jeez, it will be pointless to get into the groove of a focused study session for just thirty measly minutes”, he thinks out loud.  He convinces himself that it would be in his best interest to save the reading for after lunch.  So logs into Facebook, replies to a few messages from his friends and then heads off to meet Jane.Once he returns from lunch an hour and a half later, he feels exhausted.  The post-meal grogginess is kicking in hard.  “All I need is another round of Starbucks and I’ll be ready”, he thinks to himself.  He heads out to grab it. As he sits back down at his desk with his coffee he repeats the word “focus” over and over as a mantra to himself.  He cracks the book back open.  Page one: “Welcome to the exciting world of computer hardware design.  This book is divided into…”  But then…  His neighbor knocks on his door.  “Turn on the Local 6 news channel.  The college apartment complex down the street is on fire”, his neighbor says.  Again, he puts down the book and then clicks on the television.  This should only take a second…Yeah… right…Procrastination is a deadly, cyclical virus.Stop Procrastination 101Plan, Prioritize and Dedicate Time  – Make a bulleted list of the things you need to accomplish, denote the next action you need to take for each bullet point, prioritize based on due dates, and dedicate a window of time for getting each bullet point done.  Once you have your plan setup, do NOT deviate from it unless a real emergency occurs.Disconnect Yourself – Go to the library or another quiet location where nobody can disrupt and distract you.  Leave your cell phone and internet connection behind.Start Early, Finish Early – The gym, along with everything else you’d rather be doing, must wait.  Get the important tasks done first thing in the morning when your mind is fresh.  Once the weight is lifted, the rest of the day is yours.

Extend them all the care, kindness and understanding you can muster. Your life will never be the same again.– Og MandinoBe Attentive to Others and Never Stop Listening – Self-centered people are usually unlikable.  When you’re involved in a conversation, it’s important to focus more on the other person and less on yourself.  If you genuinely concern yourself with others and listen to them closely, you’ll make scores of friends with little effort.  Remember, everybody loves a good listener.Compliment People Who Deserve It – Go out of your way to personally acknowledge and complement the people who have gone out of their way to shine.  Everybody likes to hear that their efforts are appreciated.Make Yourself Available and Approachable – If people cannot get a hold of you, or have trouble approaching you, they will forget about you.  Your general availability and accessibility to others is extremely important to them.  Always maintain a positive, tolerant attitude and keep an open line of communication to those around you.Speak Clearly so People Can Understand You – Most people have a very low tolerance for dealing with people they can’t understand.  Mystery does not fuel strong relationships and likeability.Never Try to Be Someone You’re Not – All people have the subconscious ability to detect bullshit.  Even academy award winning actors slip up every now and then.  Fake people are not likeable.  Ask yourself this: If you don’t like who you really are, why the heck should I like you?Address People by Their Name – People love the sight and sound of their own name, so make sure you learn to remember names.  Use them respectfully in both oral and written communication.Mirror the Person You’re Conversing With – You can mirror someone by imitating their body language, gestures, movements and facial expressions during a one on one conversation.  The other person will unconsciously pickup on the familiarity of your mirrored actions, which will provide them with an added sense of comfort as they speak with you.  The more comfortable you make them feel, the more they will enjoy being around you.Always Ask to Help… and Help When Asked – Everyone appreciates the gift of free assistance and those who supply it.  Highly likeable people always spare time for others, regardless of how busy their own schedules are.  Remember, helping people get what they want is the #1 key to getting what you want.Never Get Caught Lying – Everybody stretches the truth at times, but everyone hates a liar.  Ironic, isn’t it?  Regardless, understand that your credibility and likeability will get crushed if you are caught telling a lie.Say “Please” and “Thank You” – These 2 simple phrases make demands sound like requests and inject a friendly tone into serious conversations.  It can mean the difference between sounding rude and sounding genuinely grateful.Use Positive Language (Body and Verbal) – You can use positive language skills to exhibit yourself as a helpful, constructive person rather than a destructive, disinterested one.  Positive body language involves the act of maintaining eye contact while speaking, using hand gestures to accentuate important points, leaning in closer while someone else is speaking, smiling, and mirroring the person you’re involved in a conversation with.  Positive verbal language concentrates on what can be done, suggests helpful choices and alternatives, and sounds accommodating and encouraging rather than one-dimensionally bureaucratic.Smile – Everyone likes the sight of a genuine smile.  Think about how you feel when a complete stranger looks into your eyes and smiles.  Suddenly she doesn’t seem like a stranger anymore, does she?  Instead she seems warm and friendly, someone you wouldn’t mind being around for a little while longer.Keep Unqualified Opinions to Yourself – If you don’t have all the facts, or you’re uneducated on the topic of discussion, it’s in your best interest to spend your time listening.  Unqualified opinions just make a person sound foolishly arrogant.Provide Tangible Value – Don’t just follow in the footsteps of everyone else.  Figure out which pieces of the puzzle are missing and put them in place.  When you add tangible value, you increase your own value in the eyes of others.Respect Elders, Respect Minors, Respect Everyone – There are no boundaries or classes that define a group of people that deserve to be respected.  Treat everyone with the same level of respect you would give to your grandfather and the same level of patience you would have with your baby brother.  People will notice your kindness.Make Frequent Eye Contact… but Don’t Stare – There’s little doubt that eye contact is one of the most captivating forms of personal communication.  When executed properly, eye contact injects closeness into human interaction, which leads to likeability.  The key is to make frequent eye contact without gawking.  If you fail to make eye contact you will be seen as insincere and untrustworthy.  Likewise, an overbearing stare can make you appear arrogant and egotistical.Don’t Over-Promise… Instead, Over-Deliver – Some people habitually make promises they are just barely able to fulfill.  They promise perfection and deliver mediocrity.  Sure, they do deliver something.  But it’s not inline with the original expectations, so all it does is drive negative press.  If you want people to like you, forget about making promises and simply over-deliver on everything you do.Stand Up for Your Beliefs Without Promoting Them – Yes, it is possible to stand up for your beliefs without foisting them down someone else’s throat.  Discuss your personal beliefs when someone asks about them, but don’t spawn offensive attacks of propaganda on unsuspecting victims.  Stand firm by your values and always keep an open mind to new information.Make a Firm Handshake – There is a considerable correlation between the characteristics of a firm handshake (strength, duration, eye contact, etc.) and a positive first impression.Keep Your Hands Away from Your Face – Putting your hands on your face during a conversation tells the other person that you’re either bored, negatively judging them, or trying to hide something.Dress Clean – “Clothes and manners do not make the man; but, when he is made, they greatly improve his appearance.”  Henry Ward said that, and he knew exactly what he was talking about.  People will always judge a book by its cover.  While a stylish dress code is not absolutely necessary, it can drastically alter another person’s perception of you.Also,

Fighting Laziness at Work|https://i0.wp.com/www.marcandangel.com/images/fight-laziness.jpg?resize=464%2C217&ssl=1| Laziness can ferociously creep up on us at work even when we’re consciously committed to getting things done.  It’s a byproduct those evil shiny objects passing through our periphery just begging for attention.  We try to fight them off, but sometimes it’s an arduous battle we can’t seem to win.  After all, being lazy is what our unconscious minds would rather being doing anyways.  Not all is lost though.  With the help of a few black belt techniques, laziness can be conquered.  You just have to game your mind before your mind falls victim to the lazy game.  Here’s how…Laziness may appear attractive, but work gives satisfaction.– Anne FrankFully Understand the True Consequences of Being Lazy – If you are habitually lazy on the job there’s a good chance that you’re not fulfilling all of your responsibilities.  If you’re not fulfilling your responsibilities then you’re not doing your job, and thus, you’re not worth paying.  It’s only a matter on time before your superiors notice this and eliminate the dead weight.  There’s a pretty good article on About.com entitled “How To Get Fired.”  Take a quit look at this article and ask yourself, “How many of these points pertain to laziness?”  Similarly, if a self-employed person gets lazy, you can be fairly certain they will not be self-employed for long.Never Lose Sight of the Whole Elephant – I’ve heard people use the phrase “take one bite of the elephant at a time” more times than I can count.  It is true, breaking up a large project into a series of smaller, bite-sized milestones is a smart way to hone your concentration and keep yourself motivated in the short-term.  However, it is never wise to completely lose sight of the whole elephant (the big picture).  After all, the whole elephant is the only reason you started working in the first place.  At some point you want to get promoted, land that full-size contract deal and have the opportunity to get ahead of the pack.  Those are big picture goals, goals that motivate long-term drive.  You must always remain cognizant of the fact that a bit of laziness now on a few small tasks may snowball into a lengthy stretch of missed opportunities in the future when the judge compares your performance to that of your peers.Don’t Stop Doing… Start the Next Related Task – Once you stop, laziness kicks in and it’s hard to get going again.  The key is to complete a task and then immediately jump to the next related task.  I consider a related task to be any task with a similar type required mental thinking.  Your mind can transition seamlessly between related tasks because your efforts on the previously completed tasks have already geared your mind for the type of work required in all the subsequent tasks.  The sooner you forge ahead, the more confident you will feel going into it and the more productive you will be.Do Work for You Too – Far too often I see competent, hardworking people only doing work for someone else, usually their employer.  When the workload is extremely light (or the day comes to and end), they get lazy and do less instead of transitioning their attention to accomplishing something for themselves.  If all you’re hard work is spent growing someone else’s business and all your free time is spent being lazy, you will never grow a business of your own.  Avoid laziness by spending your down time working for you.  The more you accomplish for yourself, the more motivated you will be in all walks of your work life.Setup Physical Barriers Against Distractions – Distractions lead to laziness, and unfortunately, distractions are friggin’ everywhere!  If you’re like me, you love to check your favorite blogs and reddit.com 50 times a day.  How do I conquer the urge?  I setup a physical distraction barrier by unplugging my internet connection while I’m working.  If you’re like my wife, Angel, you are prone to spending too much of your “work at home” time watching Lifetime movies.  How do I conquer her urge for her?  I hide the dang remote!  😉  In all seriousness, sometimes you must setup physical barriers between yourself and the distractions that attempt to overpower your conscious will to work.Actually Schedule In Late Afternoon Goof-Off Time – One of the most effective anti-laziness tricks I’ve implemented actually involves scheduling in goof-off time each afternoon at 4PM.  By doing so, I have slowly eliminated my spontaneous urges to check my favorite blogs and news sites because I now know I have a scheduled time to do so.  This may seem odd, or even somewhat counterproductive, but it has actually skyrocketed my early morning through mid-afternoon productivity levels.  So even though I’ve committed to being lazy in the late afternoon, the entire early part of my day (when my mind freshest) is spent in the zone without the physiological urge to slack off and succumb to laziness.Coach Yourself Out Loud… Inch by Inch – This is another one that sounds strange (literally), but truly is an effective self-motivation method.  Break the task you’re currently working on into a few smaller, logical steps and then coach yourself through them out loud.  “You have to get this done!  This step is so easy!  Let’s do it right now!”  When you complete a step, congratulate yourself on a job well done.  “That was great work!  You’re on fire!  We’re going to be finished with this in no time!”  I find that coaching myself out loud through each step actually makes me more cognizant of my forward progress, thus motivating me to work even harder on the next small step.  Success is just a game of inches.  Every small inch of forward progress is a grand accomplishment, because at some point you will be able to add up all those inches.  When you do, you will find yourself in the end zone… Touchdown!Take Mentally and Physically Active Reward Breaks – Taking a short, productive break in between every solid hour of work is something I strongly recommend, but only if you spend your short breaks doing something that actively stimulates your mind and body.  Inactive activities promote laziness and mid-day fatigue.  Take a quick stroll around the office, get up and talk to someone you enjoy speaking with, or crank-up your iPod and listen to a song that motivates you.  Whatever you do, stay active and alert.Refuel Your Mind and Body with Premium Everyday – You are what you eat!  If you eat like crap, you will feel like crap.  If you feel like crap, you will produce crappy work.  Don’t sell yourself short of your full potential.  Refuel your mind and body with premium, healthy food and 8 hours of sleep each night.  Most unhealthy eaters who don’t receive enough sleep are unsurprisingly lethargic in every waking hour of their existence.Photo by: Philippe Leroyer "
